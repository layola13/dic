词源:
From Middle English *codde, from Old Norse koddi (“bag, scrotum, testicle”), from Proto-Germanic *kudǭ (“testicle, cod”), ultimately perhaps related to Proto-Indo-European *gew- (“to bend, curve”).  The fish is so named in allusion to its bulging belly.  The verb sense is a humorous back-formation.
