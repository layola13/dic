```n. |伪视镜，假视镜 |一种光学仪器，通过它观察到的图像与正常视觉相反，例如凹面看起来像凸面，凸面看起来像凹面。| Example:  The pseudoscope inverts the perceived depth of objects, making concave surfaces appear convex and vice versa. 伪视镜反转物体感知到的深度，使凹面看起来像凸面，反之亦然。|近义词：stereoscope (with opposite effect)  |反义词：stereoscope (产生相反效果) |名词)**: meaning "to look," "to watch," or "to observe."is primarily a tool used in the study of visual perception and depth perception. It's not a commonly used device in everyday life. Its main application is to demonstrate the role of learned visual cues in our interpretation of three-dimensional space.  By reversing these cues, the pseudoscope highlights how our brains actively construct ourperception of depth rather than passively receiving it.:** "Experiments using the pseudoscope have shown that depth perception is not solely reliant on retinal disparity." 使用伪视镜的实验表明，深度知觉并非完全依赖于视网膜视差。our understanding of how the brain processes visual information." 19 世纪伪视镜的发明极大地促进了我们对大脑如何处理视觉信息的理解。are optical instruments dealing with three-dimensional perception, they have opposite effects:convex and vice versa. It disrupts normal depth perception.  This reversal can be quite disorienting for the viewer."stereoscope" because it produces the opposite perceptual effect.  However, it's more accurate to describe them as having contrasting functions rather than being strict antonyms.✩鉴于伪视镜颠覆了深度知觉，它在研究大脑如何处理错觉方面还有哪些未被探索的潜力？伪视镜的发明对19世纪的艺术创作，特别是绘画和雕塑的透视技巧，产生了怎样的影响？将伪视镜的技术原理应用于虚拟现实技术，能否创造出更沉浸式、更具欺骗性的虚拟环境？
