Etymology:
"overpromptness" is derived from "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") + "prompt" (meaning "done without delay") + "-ness" (a suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality).  "Prompt" itself comes from the Latin "promptus," the past participle of "promere," meaning "to bring forth" or "to produce." The plural form, "overpromptnesses," simply adds the standard English plural suffix "-es."
