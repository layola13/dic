PHRASE->
(Due to the vulgar nature of one meaning of "cooney," common phrases are not applicable and would be highly inappropriate.)  It's best to avoid using this word altogether, especially in the offensive context.  If referring to a rabbit, simply use "rabbit."


注意事项:
The primary meaning of "cooney" is a highly offensive and derogatory slang term for a woman's genitalia.  Its use is strongly discouraged. While it can also refer to a rabbit in some regions, using "rabbit" is always preferable to avoid misinterpretation and causing offense.
