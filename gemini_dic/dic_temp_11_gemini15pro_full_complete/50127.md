USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The dentry stores information about a file. =  目录项存储关于文件的信息。
The file system uses dentries to locate files. = 文件系统使用目录项来定位文件。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The system is caching the dentry for faster access. = 系统正在缓存目录项以便更快地访问。
The kernel is updating the dentry with the new file information. = 内核正在用新的文件信息更新目录项。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The system has added the dentry to the cache. = 系统已将目录项添加到缓存中。
The process has accessed the file through its dentry. = 进程已通过其目录项访问了文件。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The system has been updating the dentry continuously. = 系统一直在不断更新目录项。
The process has been using this dentry for a while now. =  该进程已经使用此目录项一段时间了。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The system created a new dentry for the file. = 系统为文件创建了一个新的目录项。
The kernel removed the dentry from the cache. = 内核从缓存中删除了目录项。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was updating the dentry when the power went out. = 断电时系统正在更新目录项。
The kernel was searching for the dentry in the cache. = 内核正在缓存中搜索目录项。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The system had already cached the dentry before the file was opened. = 在打开文件之前，系统已经缓存了目录项。
The kernel had deleted the dentry before the file was closed. = 在文件关闭之前，内核已经删除了目录项。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been using the dentry for some time before it was removed. = 在删除之前，系统已经使用该目录项一段时间了。
The kernel had been searching for the dentry for several seconds before finding it. =  在找到之前，内核已经搜索该目录项几秒钟了。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The system will create a dentry for the new file. = 系统将为新文件创建一个目录项。
The kernel will cache the dentry for faster access later. = 内核将缓存目录项以便以后更快地访问。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be updating the dentry at that time. = 系统将在那个时候更新目录项。
The kernel will be searching for the dentry in the cache. = 内核将在缓存中搜索目录项。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The system will have cached the dentry by the time the file is opened. = 到文件打开时，系统将已经缓存了目录项。
The kernel will have removed the dentry by the time the process terminates. = 到进程终止时，内核将已经删除了目录项。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the system will have been using this dentry for a month. = 到下周，系统将已经使用此目录项一个月了。
By the end of the process, the kernel will have been referencing this dentry extensively. = 到进程结束时，内核将已经广泛引用此目录项。


PHRASE->
negative dentry = 否定目录项
dentry cache =  目录项缓存
dentry lookup = 目录项查找
invalid dentry = 无效目录项
