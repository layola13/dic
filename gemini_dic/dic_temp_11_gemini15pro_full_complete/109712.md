词源:

"leveful" is likely a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining "level" with the suffix "-ful."  "Level" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from the Latin "libella" (a small balance, level), related to "libra" (balance, scales). The suffix "-ful" comes from Old English "-ful," meaning "full of." Therefore, "leveful" literally suggests something "full of levelness" or "characterized by being level."
