##overtrain| v. | 过度训练 | To train (a person or animal)excessively, often to the point of exhaustion or injury;  to train (a machine learning model) to the point that it performs well on training data but poorlyon unseen data. | *He overtrained for the marathon and ended up injured.*  他为马拉松过度训练，结果受伤了。 *Theneural network was overtrained, leading to poor generalization performance.* 神经网络过度训练，导致泛化性能差。 | train excessively, overwork | undertrainword formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the verb "train."  The root of "train" can be traced back to Old French *train*, meaning "to draw, drag, pull." This in turn possibly originates from the Vulgar Latin *trahīnāre*, a frequentative form of *trahere*, meaning "to pull" or "to draw."  The modern English meaning of "train" evolved through its use in various contexts, encompassing the ideas of guiding,teaching, and preparing for a specific goal. The addition of "over-" infuses the root meaning with the sense of exceeding a reasonable or effective limit.engaging in excessive physical activity or training beyond the body's capacity to recover, resulting in injuries, exhaustion, or reduced performance.  This often involves neglecting rest and recovery periods which are crucial for muscle growth and improved athletic skill.when a model learns the training data too well, memorizing the specifics instead of learning the underlying patterns. This leads to high accuracy on the training set but poor performance on new, unseen data (the test set). This phenomenon is often addressed by techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping to prevent themodel from becoming overly specialized to the training data.  In essence, the model becomes too specialized to the data it's trained on, and loses the ability to generalize to new data.  This is considered undesirable, as the real-world application of a machine learning model requires it to generalize to new examples.Think of it like a student who memorizes the answers to the practice exam rather than understanding the material – they'll do well on the practice exam, but poorly on the final exam.if they aren't careful with their training schedules. 运动员如果不注意训练计划，经常会过度训练。He overtrained last year and missed the entire season due to injury. 他去年过度训练，由于受伤错过了整个赛季。**Present Perfect:** He has overtrained several times in his career, impacting his long-term success. 他在他的职业生涯中多次过度训练，影响了他的长期成功。导致结果令人失望。将为奥运会选拔赛进行过度训练。
