词源:  Abbreviation of mistress.  "Mistress" originally meant "woman in charge of something," later "woman head of a household," and eventually acquired the specific sense of "woman having an illicit sexual relationship with a man." "Mrs." emerged as a polite title for married women, separate from the other meanings of "mistress."
