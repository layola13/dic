ionicize:/ˈaɪənɪzaɪz/ /ˈaɪənaɪz/ | v. | 电离，离子化 | To convert (an atom, molecule, or substance) into an ion or ions, typically by removing or adding electrons. |  Lightning can ionicize the air. 闪电可以使空气电离。|  The intense heat ionicized the gas.  高温使气体离子化。 | ionise, charge | deionize, neutralize | verb

Etymology->
From *ion* + *-ize*. *Ion* comes from Greek *iōn*, "going", present participle of *ienai*, "to go".  *-ize* is a suffix forming verbs from Greek *izein* and Latin *-izare*.
