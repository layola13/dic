l-glucose:/ˌɛl ˈɡluːkoʊs/
noun
左旋葡萄糖
L-glucose is the enantiomer of D-glucose, meaning it is a mirror image that cannot be superimposed.  It is a monosaccharide that differs from D-glucose in its spatial arrangement of atoms.
L-glucose is not metabolized by most organisms.  It is used in some research applications.
L-Glucose is less sweet than D-glucose. 左旋葡萄糖不如右旋葡萄糖甜。
L-glucose has potential applications in pharmaceuticals. 左旋葡萄糖在制药方面有潜在的应用。

synonym: (No commonly used synonym for its specific chemical meaning, but other monosaccharides like L-mannose and L-galactose are related.)
antonym: D-glucose
