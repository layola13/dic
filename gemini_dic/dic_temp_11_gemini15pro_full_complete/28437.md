carboxide: /kɑːrˈbɒksaɪd/
noun
碳氧化物; 一氧化碳
A binary compound of carbon with oxygen, especially carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless flammable gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone.
例句：Carbon monoxide, or carboxide, is a poisonous gas. 一氧化碳，或碳氧化物，是一种有毒气体。

例句：Exposure to high levels of carboxide can be fatal. 暴露于高浓度的一氧化碳可能是致命的。

近义词：carbon monoxide
反义词:  (No direct antonym for a chemical compound)
词性: n.
