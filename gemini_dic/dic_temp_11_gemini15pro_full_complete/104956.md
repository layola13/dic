kelvin:/ˈkɛlvɪn/| n.|开尔文（温度单位）|A unit of absolute temperature, where zero kelvin (0 K) is absolute zero, the point at which all molecular motion ceases.  The size of one kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius.|例句：Water freezes at 273.15 kelvin.  水在273.15开尔文时结冰。

|例句：Room temperature is approximately 300 kelvin. 室温大约是300开尔文。|近义词：K (abbreviation)|反义词: N/A|词性:noun
