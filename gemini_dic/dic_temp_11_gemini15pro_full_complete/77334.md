gauchely: /ˈɡoʊʃli/ (US), /ˈɡəʊʃli/ (UK) | adv. | 笨拙地，不优雅地 |  In a socially awkward or clumsy manner; lacking grace or tact. |  He gauchely asked her to dance, tripping over his own feet. 他笨拙地邀请她跳舞，还被自己的脚绊倒了。|  She gauchely complimented her friend's new haircut, making it sound like an insult.  她笨拙地称赞朋友的新发型，听起来像是在侮辱人。 |  awkwardly, clumsily, ineptly | gracefully, elegantly, smoothly | adverb

Etymology:
From French *gauche* "left, awkward," perhaps from Frankish *wauk*, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *wenkaz*  "crooked, bent."  The connection to "left" likely arose from the fact that most people are right-handed, making the left hand less skilled and therefore "awkward."
