PHRASE-> (Since Oliver is a proper noun,  phrases are less applicable.  Here are examples using the general term "name"):

What's your name? 你叫什么名字？
What's his name again?  他叫什么名字来着？
What was the name of that book? 那本书叫什么名字？
I can't remember the name of the street. 我不记得那条街的名字了。

注意事项:  As demonstrated, applying verb tenses directly to a proper noun like "Olivers" (plural) can be somewhat awkward.  It's more natural to use the singular "Oliver" or to refer to the "Oliver family."
