depolarizer:/ˌdiːˈpoʊləˌraɪzər/ | n. |去极化剂；消偏振器|A substance that removes polarization, especially from an electric cell or battery, allowing current to flow freely.  It counteracts the buildup of opposing charges that hinder the flow of electricity.| The battery's depolarizer allows it to function for a longer period.  电池的去极化剂使其能够工作更长时间。| synonyms:  neutralizer, counteragent | antonyms: polarizer | noun
