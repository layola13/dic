注意事项:
* "Intercohesion's" is not a commonly used word. "Intercohesion" itself is already infrequent. Using the possessive form makes it even rarer.  It's often more natural to rephrase using "the intercohesion of..."

词源: "Inter-" (prefix meaning "between, among, mutually") + "cohesion" (from Latin "cohaerere" - to stick together).
