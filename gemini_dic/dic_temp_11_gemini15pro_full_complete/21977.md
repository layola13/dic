ETYMOLOGY->
From French *bohémien*, from *Bohême* "Bohemia" (now a region of Czech Republic).  Bohemia was mistakenly believed to be the origin of the Romani people (also called "gypsies").  Therefore, "bohemian" became associated with the perceived nomadic and unconventional lifestyle of the Romani, and later with artists and writers who lived a similarly unconventional life.
