Etymology:
From over- + skeptical + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Skeptical" comes from the Greek "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring" or "thoughtful," referring to a philosophical school that questioned the possibility of certain knowledge.  "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
