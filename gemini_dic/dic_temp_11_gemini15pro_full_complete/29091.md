ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *karyatis*, plural *karyatides*, meaning "women of Karyai".  Karyai was a town in Laconia, ancient Greece, whose women were famed for their beauty and graceful dancing.  The term likely arose because the women of Karyai participated in rituals involving the carrying of sacred objects, which may have inspired the architectural form.
