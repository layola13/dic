PHRASE->
(Not applicable.  "Affrontingly" is an adverb and doesn't typically form set phrases. It modifies verbs and adjectives, describing *how* something is done, not forming noun-like units.)


词源:
From affront + -ing + -ly.  "Affront" comes from the Old French "afronter" meaning "to strike on the forehead,"  later evolving to mean "to insult."
