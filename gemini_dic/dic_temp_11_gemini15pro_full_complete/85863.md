ETYMOLOGY->
This idiom originates from the physical act of tumbling head over heels, which suggests a loss of control and disorientation. This sense of being overwhelmed is then transferred metaphorically to the feeling of being deeply in love. The first recorded use of the phrase in its figurative sense dates back to the 14th century.
