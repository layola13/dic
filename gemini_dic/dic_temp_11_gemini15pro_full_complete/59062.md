词源:
From Old English dwellan "to lead astray, hinder, delay, deceive," from Proto-Germanic *dwaljanan "to wander, go astray, err" (source also of Old Saxon dwalon "to err," Old Norse dvelja "to delay, tarry," Old Frisian dwala "to err, lead astray," Middle Dutch dwellen "to delay, hinder," Old High German twellan "to hinder," German twellen "to loiter"). The meaning shifted in Middle English to "linger, tarry, remain," then to "reside, inhabit."


注意事项:  dwells 是 dwell 的第三人称单数形式。
