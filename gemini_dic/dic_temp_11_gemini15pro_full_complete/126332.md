注意事项:

"myos-" itself is not a word used in isolation in English.  It is a combining form, meaning it combines with other words or parts of words to create new medical terms.  Therefore, providing examples of its use in different tenses is not entirely applicable, as it doesn't function as an independent verb, noun, or adjective. The usage examples provided above demonstrate how words containing "myos-" can be used in sentences.
