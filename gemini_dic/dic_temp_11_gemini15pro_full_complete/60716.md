ETYMOLOGY->
electro- (prefix): from Greek *ēlektron* meaning "amber," referring to static electricity.
-oculographically (suffix): from Greek *okoulus* meaning "eye" + *-graphos* meaning "writing" + *-ikos* (adjectival suffix) + *-ly* (adverbial suffix).  Therefore, relating to the recording of eye movements.
