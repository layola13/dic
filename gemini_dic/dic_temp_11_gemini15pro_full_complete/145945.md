词源:
From over- + discreet + -ness.  "Over-" acts as an intensifier, meaning "excessively" or "too much."  "Discreet" comes from the Latin "discretus," meaning "separated, distinguished," implying a careful separation of words and actions. "-ness" turns the adjective "overdiscreet" into the noun "overdiscreetness."
