ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *amber*, from Old French *ambre*, from Medieval Latin *ambar*, from Arabic *ʿanbar* ('ambergris'), probably via Vulgar Latin *ambra*, alteration of Latin *ambrosia*.  The confusion arose because both ambergris and amber are found washed ashore.  Later, the meaning shifted to refer specifically to the fossilized resin.
