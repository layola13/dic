From Canadian French *dalle* (plural *dalles*), meaning "flagstone," "slab," or "gutter." Ultimately from Old French *daille*, meaning "plank" or "board," derived from Latin *talea*, meaning "cutting," "rod," or "stick." The term was used by French explorers to describe the flat, exposed bedrock formations along rivers.
