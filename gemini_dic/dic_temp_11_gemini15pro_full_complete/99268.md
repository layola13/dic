interconfounded:/ˌɪntərˌkənˈfaʊndɪd/ | adj. |  互相混淆的，互相干扰的 |  Confused or intertwined in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish separate elements or effects.  It implies a more complex mixing than simply "confounded."  | The results of the study were interconfounded by the multiple variables, making it difficult to determine the true cause of the observed effect. 研究结果被多个变量互相干扰，难以确定观察到的效应的真正原因。| 近义词: confounded, entangled, intertwined | 反义词: distinct, separate | 词性: 形容词

词源:  "Inter-" (prefix meaning "between" or "among") + "confound" (from Latin "confundere" meaning "to pour together," "mix," or "confuse").

注意事项:  Because "interconfounded" is a relatively uncommon and technical term, it's crucial to use it accurately and in appropriate contexts.  Consider using simpler synonyms like "confounded," "entangled," or "intertwined" if the nuance of complex intermixing isn't essential to your meaning.
