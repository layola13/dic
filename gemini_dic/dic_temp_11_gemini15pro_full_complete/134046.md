Etymology:
non- (prefix):  from Latin *non "not"
identification (noun): from identify + -fication.  Identify comes from Late Latin identificare "to make identical, identify," from Latin idem "the same" + facere "to make."  The suffix -fication comes from French -fication, ultimately from Latin -ficātiō, from the verb stem of facere "to do, make."
