词源: From Old English *drugoth, from Proto-Germanic *drugaz. Cognate with Old Norse draugr (“apparition, ghost”).  The semantic shift from "dryness" to "apparition" likely occurred due to the association of dryness with death and decay.  The modern sense of "prolonged period of dryness" developed later.
