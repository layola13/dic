ETYMOLOGY->
From caving, which is the present participle of the verb 'cave', meaning to explore caves. 'Cave' itself comes from the Old French word 'cave' meaning 'cave, cellar, vault', ultimately derived from the Latin 'cavus' meaning 'hollow'.  The '-ing' suffix creates a gerund, which functions as a noun. The apostrophe and 's' indicate the possessive form of the gerund.
