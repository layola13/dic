PHRASE->

(Due to the abstract nature of "incognizance's," it doesn't readily form common phrases.  It's more often used in formal contexts describing a lack of awareness or knowledge.)


注意事项:  The word "incognizance's" is grammatically unusual. "Incognizance" itself is already a noun, and adding an apostrophe 's' to it makes it a possessive, implying that the incognizance *possesses* something.  It would be much more common and natural to simply use "incognizance" or rephrase the sentence.  For example, instead of "His incognizance's of the situation was surprising," it would be more natural to say "His incognizance of the situation was surprising" or "His being incognizant of the situation was surprising."
