ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *bounden*, *bownden*, from Old Norse *búinn* (past participle of *búa* (“to prepare, make ready, dwell”)), from Proto-Germanic *būaną* (“to dwell, inhabit”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰew- (“to be, exist, grow”). Cognate with Danish *bo* (“to dwell”), Swedish *bo* (“to dwell”), Icelandic *búa* (“to dwell, live, prepare”).  The meaning "leap" is probably from a Scandinavian source, perhaps influenced by Old Norse *búinn* in the sense "ready to start."
