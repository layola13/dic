"Practicable" comes from the Late Middle English "practicable," from Old French, from Medieval Latin "practicabilis," from "practicāre" (to practice), from Latin "prāctica" (practice), from Greek "πρακτική" (praktikē).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
