nonvegetative:/ˌnɒnˈvɛdʒɪtətɪv/ | adj. | 非植物性的，无营养的 | Not relating to or characteristic of plant life or growth; not supporting growth.  Describes a state or part of an organism not involved in growth or reproduction. | The nonvegetative parts of the bacteria were studied under a microscope.  在显微镜下研究了细菌的非植物性部分。| The bacteria's nonvegetative spores can survive harsh conditions. 细菌的非营养性孢子可以在恶劣的环境中生存。| 近义词: non-growing, dormant, inactive | 反义词: vegetative, growing, reproductive | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
From "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "vegetative" (from Latin "vegetativus," meaning "quickening, enlivening, animating," from "vegetare," meaning "to animate, quicken," related to "vegere," meaning "to be lively, vigorous").

PHRASE->
nonvegetative state  非营养状态
nonvegetative bacteria 非营养细菌
nonvegetative spores 非营养孢子
nonvegetative reproduction  无性繁殖 (While this is a common phrase, it's important to note that "nonvegetative" doesn't directly mean asexual.  Asexual reproduction can still involve vegetative parts.  This phrase usually refers to reproduction through spores or other non-growth structures.)
nonvegetative propagation  无性繁殖 (Similar caution as above applies)
