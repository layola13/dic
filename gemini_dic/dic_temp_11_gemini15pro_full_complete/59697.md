注意事项:
While "echt" is a valid word, it's not frequently used in modern English.  Its use is generally confined to specific contexts, such as discussions about art, antiques, or cultural authenticity.  It might sound somewhat archaic or affected in everyday conversation.  Using synonyms like "genuine," "authentic," or "real" is often more natural.
