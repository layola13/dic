词源:  Likely a variation of "doobie," which itself is of uncertain origin, potentially influenced by slang terms related to drugs and smoking.  One theory suggests it may be related to the 1970s slang term "doobie brothers," referring to people who smoked marijuana together. Another theory connects it to the word "dub," referring to something considered low-quality or fake, perhaps initially applied to poorly rolled joints.
