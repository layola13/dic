homochlamydeous:/ˌhɒməʊkləˈmɪdiəs/| adj.|同被的，同花被的|Having a perianth that is not differentiated into calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but consists of tepals.  The perianth segments are all alike or nearly so.|Example 1: Tulips are homochlamydeous, with brightly colored tepals that attract pollinators.|例句 1：郁金香是同被的，其色彩鲜艳的花被片吸引传粉者。

Example 2: Many lilies are also homochlamydeous, with six undifferentiated tepals.|例句 2：许多百合花也是同被的，有六个未分化的花被片。|近义词:monochlamydeous (sometimes)|反义词:heterochlamydeous|词性:adjective

Etymology:
From *homo- (Greek, "same") + *chlamys* (Greek, "cloak, mantle") + *-ous* (adjective suffix).  *Chlamys* in botany refers to the perianth, the outer envelope of a flower, which in some plants is differentiated into a calyx and corolla.
