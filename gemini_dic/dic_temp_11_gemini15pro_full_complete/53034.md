dioecia:/daɪˈiːʃə/
n.
雌雄异株
The condition in which male and female reproductive structures are on separate plants.
Dioecia is a common phenomenon in many plant species, such as holly. 雌雄异株是许多植物物种中的常见现象，例如冬青。

Dioecious plants require both male and female plants to be present for fertilization to occur. 雌雄异株的植物需要雄株和雌株同时存在才能进行受精。
