The word "gaglani" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It likely doesn't exist or might be a misspelling, slang term, or a proper noun specific to a particular region or community.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more insights.  For example, is it a surname, a place name, or a term used in a specific online community?

Since I cannot analyze "gaglani," I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "happen" as an example:

happen:/ˈhæpən/| v. |发生，碰巧| to occur, to take place by chance|例句：The accident happened so fast. 事故发生得太快了。|例句：What happened to your car? 你的车怎么了？|近义词：occur, transpire, befall|反义词:prevent|词性:动词
