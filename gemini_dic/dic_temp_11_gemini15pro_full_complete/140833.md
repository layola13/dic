词源：  "On-side" originates from sports, specifically from games like soccer and rugby where a player's position relative to the ball and opposing players determines legality.  It has since expanded to more general usage, referring to being in a permitted or agreeable position in various contexts.  "On" indicates position and "side" refers to the correct or permitted area or perspective.
