fumaroles:/ˈfjuːməroʊlz/ (US), /ˈfjuːməˌrəʊlz/ (UK)| n. | 喷气孔；火山喷气孔 | An opening in or near a volcano, from which hot sulfurous gases emerge. |  The scientists studied the gases emitted from the fumaroles on the volcano's slopes. 科学家们研究了火山斜坡上喷气孔排放出的气体。

Example: The air around the fumaroles was thick with the smell of sulfur.  喷气孔周围的空气中弥漫着硫磺的味道。

Example:  Fumaroles are often a sign of volcanic activity. 喷气孔通常是火山活动的标志。


Synonyms: vents, openings, fissures

Antonyms: N/A (No direct antonym for a geological feature)

Etymology: From Italian *fumarola*, from *fumare* "to smoke," from Latin *fumare* "to smoke."
