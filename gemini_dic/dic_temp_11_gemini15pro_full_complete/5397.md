ETYMOLOGY->
From Hebrew *`almah` (young woman, maiden), related to Arabic *`alima` (to know, be aware, be learned). The term has been subject to much debate, particularly in relation to the Septuagint's translation as "parthenos" (virgin) in Isaiah 7:14.  This translation has influenced Christian interpretations of the prophecy.
