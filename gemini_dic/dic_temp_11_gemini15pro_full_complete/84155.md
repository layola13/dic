词源：
"half-" comes from Old English "healf," meaning "side, part, portion."
"oxidized" comes from "oxide,"  ultimately from French "oxygène" (oxygen),  with "-ize" added to form a verb meaning "to combine with oxygen."  Therefore, "half-oxidized" literally means "combined with oxygen to a partial extent."
