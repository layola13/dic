Etymology:
From nutrition + -al + -ly.  "Nutrition" comes from the Late Latin "nutritiōn-" (stem of "nutritiō"), meaning "nourishment," which is derived from the past participle stem of "nutrire" meaning "to nourish," from "nutrix" meaning "nurse."  The "-al" suffix forms adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characterized by," and "-ly" forms adverbs from adjectives.
