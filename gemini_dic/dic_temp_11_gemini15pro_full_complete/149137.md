##oxidizable:/ˈɒksɪdaɪzəbl/ | adj.| 可氧化的 | 易氧化的；能被氧化的 |  Thismetal is highly oxidizable in humid air.  这种金属在潮湿的空气中很容易氧化。 The oil is oxidizable, leading to rancidity.这种油脂易氧化，导致变质。| 近义词：oxidative, susceptible to oxidation | 反义词：non-oxidizable,oxidation-resistant | 形容词the late 18th century by Antoine Lavoisier. Lavoisier, a key figure in the chemical revolution, realized that oxygen was a crucial component in combustion and the formation of many compounds. He coined the term “oxygène” (from Greek roots meaning "acid-former"), reflecting the then-prevalent belief that all acids contained oxygen. From "oxygène" came the verb “oxyder” (to oxidize) meaning, initially, to combine with oxygen. Over time, "oxidize" acquired a broader meaning that included reactionsinvolving oxygen loss or electron transfer, and the adjective "oxidizable"  emerged to describe substances prone to these reactions.with oxygen, but other oxidizing agents can participate as well.  This results in a change in the oxidation state of the substance. The ease with which a substance oxidizes varies depending on its chemical properties.  Some are easily oxidized (highly oxidizable) at room temperature and others require high temperatures or strong oxidizing agents foroxidation to occur.can significantly affect the performance of the catalytic converter.  易氧化杂质的存在会显著影响催化转化器的性能。关重要。对氧化的脆弱性。chemical integrity despite exposure to oxygen or oxidizing agents. 与抗氧化相似，但通常用于即使暴露于氧气或氧化剂也能保持其化学完整性的物质。science.  For example, in chemistry it might describe a compound's reactivity in redox reactions while in food science it often relates to the shelf life and quality of food products.  In materials science, the "oxidizability" of a material directly impacts its corrosion resistance and durability.
