emeership is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, possibly formed by analogy with words like leadership or scholarship.  It likely means the act or process of emerging or the state of having emerged.  The root word is "emerge."

词源:  From emerge + -ship. Emerge comes from Late Middle English: from Old French émerger, from Latin emergere ‘rise up, bring to light’, from e- (variant of ex-) ‘out of’ + mergere ‘dip, plunge’.
