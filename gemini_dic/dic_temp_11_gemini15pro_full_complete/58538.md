词源: From Middle English *duggen*, *diggen*, from Old Norse *duga* (“to be of use, be suitable, be valid, avail, be good for, last, endure”), from Proto-Germanic *duganą* (“to be good, be useful”). Cognate with Dutch *deugen* (“to be virtuous, be good, be suitable”). Related also to Old English *dugan* (“to avail, be good for, be able, be capable”).  The noun sense "teat, udder" is from a different, probably imitative, origin.
