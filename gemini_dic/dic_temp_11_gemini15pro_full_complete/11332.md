It is not commonly used in phrases in modern English.




注意事项:

"Areed" is an archaic word and rarely used in modern English. "Agreed" is the commonly used modern equivalent.  Therefore, many of the tense examples, especially continuous tenses, feel somewhat unnatural.  It's best used in simple tenses in a formal or literary context.
