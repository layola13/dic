bowssen: This word doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, providing a standard linguistic analysis is impossible.  If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed guess.

If you meant "bowson," it could potentially be a proper noun (a surname, perhaps) or another neologism.  Again, without more information, analysis is difficult.
