mesomycetes:/ˌmɛzoʊmaɪˈsiːtiːz/| n. |中菌纲|A class of fungi, formerly considered a subclass of Zygomycetes, characterized by the formation of zygospores with suspensors.|Mesomycetes are not commonly discussed anymore, as molecular evidence supports their placement within other fungal groups.|Synonym: Trichomycetes|Antonym: (No direct antonym, as these are a classification group.  Could perhaps contrast with other fungal classes like Ascomycetes or Basidiomycetes.)|noun
