collineation:/ˌkɒlɪniˈeɪʃən/ | n. | 共线化，直射变换，射影变换 | A transformation that maps lines to lines.  It preserves incidence, meaning that if three or more points lie on a line, their images under the collineation will also lie on a line. |  Example 1: The collineation transformed the triangle into another triangle.  这个直射变换将三角形转换成另一个三角形。

Example 2: Collineation plays a crucial role in projective geometry. 直射变换在射影几何中起着至关重要的作用。 | synonyms: projective transformation, homography | antonyms: N/A | noun
