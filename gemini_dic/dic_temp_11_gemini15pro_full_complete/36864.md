color-force:/ˈkʌlər fɔːrs/| n.|色力|The strong force, one of the four fundamental forces in physics, responsible for holding quarks together to form hadrons like protons and neutrons.  It's often called the "color force" because the property that mediates the force is called "color charge," analogous to electric charge in electromagnetism, but with three types (red, green, blue) instead of just positive and negative.|The color force prevents quarks from existing in isolation.|近义词:strong force, strong interaction|反义词:None (fundamental force)|词性:noun
