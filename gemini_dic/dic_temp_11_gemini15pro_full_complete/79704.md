glucina:/ɡluːˈsaɪnə/
noun
氧化铍, 铍土
A sweet-tasting, highly toxic, white or colorless crystalline compound, BeO, used in ceramics and as a neutron moderator.  It's an older, less common name for beryllium oxide.
Beryllia (beryllium oxide) was historically known as glucina due to its sweet taste.  However, due to its toxicity, tasting it is strongly discouraged.
近义词: beryllia, beryllium oxide
反义词: (No direct antonym for a chemical compound)
词性: n.


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *glucine*, from Ancient Greek γλυκύς (glukús, “sweet”) + -ine (suffix forming abstract nouns).  The name refers to the sweet taste of some beryllium salts.
