nonprimitives:/nɒnˈprɪmɪtɪvz/| n.|非基本类型，非原始类型|Data types that are not built-in, but are constructed from primitive types.  They are often referred to as reference types or object types. |Example: In Java, "String" is a nonprimitive type, while 'int' is a primitive type.|Synonyms: reference types, object types, composite types|Antonyms: primitive types|noun

nonprimitive:/nɒnˈprɪmɪtɪv/| adj.|非原始的，非基本类型的|Describing a data type that is not a primitive type. |Example:  A linked list is a nonprimitive data structure.|Synonyms: non-basic, derived, complex|Antonyms: primitive, basic, fundamental|adjective
