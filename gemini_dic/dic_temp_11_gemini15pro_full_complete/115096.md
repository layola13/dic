ETYMOLOGY->
From *manganese* + *-esian*, a suffix used to form adjectives relating to chemical elements. *Manganese* itself ultimately comes from the Italian *manganese*, from the Greek *mágnes* (magnet), due to confusion with magnetic iron ore (magnetite).  The mineral pyrolusite (MnO₂) was called *magnesia nigra* (black magnesia) in Latin.  Later, the name was altered to distinguish it from *magnesia alba* (magnesium oxide).
