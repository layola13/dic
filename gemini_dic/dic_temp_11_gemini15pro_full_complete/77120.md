garyon: /ˈɡæriən/ | n. | 加里昂（一种假设的基本粒子）| A hypothetical fundamental particle.  It is a theoretical construct in some models of particle physics. |  Scientists are exploring the possibility of garyons existing. 科学家正在探索加里昂存在的可能性。| Garyons are thought to be constituents of matter. 加里昂被认为是物质的组成部分。 | 近义词: particle, fundamental particle | 反义词:  (No direct antonym for a hypothetical particle) | 词性: noun


词源:  "Garyon" is a neologism, meaning it's a newly coined word.  It likely derives from a personal name or a combination of elements meant to suggest its theoretical nature.  There is no established etymology in recognized dictionaries.
