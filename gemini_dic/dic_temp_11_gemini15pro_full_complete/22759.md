Etymology: From Middle English *borwen, from Old English borgian (“to borrow, lend, pledge”), from Proto-Germanic *borgōną (“to borrow, lend, become surety”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰerǵʰ- (“high, elevated”). Cognate with Old Frisian borgia (“to borrow”), Middle Dutch borgen (“to borrow, lend, give bail”), Old High German borgen (“to borrow, lend, save, rescue”), German borgen (“to borrow, lend”), Old Norse bjarga (“to save, help, rescue”). Related to borough. The original sense was “to become surety for someone,” hence “to lend” and “to borrow.”
