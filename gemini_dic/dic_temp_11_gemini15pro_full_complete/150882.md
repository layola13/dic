##parakite 的详细解析| n. | 飞行伞；三角翼伞 |  一种轻便的、类似降落伞的飞行器，通常由一个三角形的帆布和控制线组成，用于滑翔飞行。 | Example: He soaredthrough the air on his parakite. (他乘着他的飞行伞在空中翱翔。) | 近义词：paraglider, hang glider |反义词：无nature and controlled flight aspect.  The "para" prefix, derived from the Greek word  "παρά" (para), means "beside," "near," or "beyond." In this context, it signifies a device that issimilar to, but distinct from, a parachute – instead of purely descending, a parakite enables gliding flight. The "kite" component speaks to the ability to control direction and maneuverability in the air, unlike a freefall parachute.  Therefore, the etymology reflects a functional description of what a parakiteis and does.of recreational or adventurous activities.  It’s not as widely used as “paraglider,” and tends to be less formal or technical in its application. While a paraglider utilizes a more sophisticated wing design, the implied similarities between these two devices show in their nomenclature.  Their similar structure allows for many of the sameaction verbs to be used in relation to each of them.中飘舞。)动作。)I fly a parakite every weekend. (我每个周末都放飞行伞。)  He flies a parakite with great skill.
