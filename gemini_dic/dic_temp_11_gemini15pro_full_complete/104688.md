karyomiton:/ˌkæriˈɒmɪtɒn/ | n. | 核丝分裂球 |A stage in nuclear division, specifically mitosis, characterized by the aggregation of chromosomes into a compact mass within the nucleus. | During karyomiton, the chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope. 在核丝分裂球阶段，染色体浓缩并在显微镜下可见。| Synonym: karyokinesis, mitosis | Antonym: meiosis | noun

Etymology:  From Greek *karyo- "kernel, nut" + mitos "thread".
