注意事项:

"Cheze" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a misspelling or variant of "chaise," which is a type of long chair or sofa.  This entire analysis is based on the assumption that "cheze" is intended to mean "chair." If a different meaning was intended, the analysis would need to be revised.
