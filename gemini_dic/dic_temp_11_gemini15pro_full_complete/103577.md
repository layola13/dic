Etymology:
The origin of "johnnycake" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's a corruption of "journey cake," a simple bread easily carried by travelers. Another posits it derives from "Shawnee cake," reflecting the Native American influence on early American cuisine.  A third theory connects it to "jonakin," a variant spelling found in early texts.
