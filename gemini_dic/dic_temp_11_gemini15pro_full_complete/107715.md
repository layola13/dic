ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lanterne, *lantern, from Anglo-Norman *lanterne, *laterne, from Old North French *lantern, from Vulgar Latin *lanterna, from Latin laterna (“a lamp, lantern, torch”), perhaps from a derivative of *latere (“to lie hidden”), from PIE *lāt- (“to hide”).  The notion is perhaps of a concealed light. Doublet of lantern.
