Etymology:  Derived from "bug" (meaning a defect or fault) + "-iness" (a suffix forming nouns indicating a state or quality).  The term "bug" in the context of computing errors is often attributed to Grace Hopper, who found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947.  However, the term "bug" referring to technical malfunctions predates this incident.
