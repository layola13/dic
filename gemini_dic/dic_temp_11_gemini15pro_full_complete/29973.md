cavicornia:/ˌkævɪˈkɔːrniə/ | n. |空角类动物|A suborder of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla) that includes ruminants with hollow horns, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and antelopes.  It is no longer considered a valid taxonomic group. | Cavicornia, although historically used, is now considered an outdated classification. 空角类动物虽然历史上曾被使用，但现在被认为是过时的分类。|  Synonyms: Bovidae (more accurate), ruminants (broader) | Antonyms:  None (since it's a biological classification, there isn't a direct opposite) | noun
