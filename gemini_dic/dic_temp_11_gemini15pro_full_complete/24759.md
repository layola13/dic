词源: From Middle English *brooken*, from Old English *brucan* (“to use, enjoy, possess, brook”), from Proto-Germanic *brukōną* (“to use, enjoy”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰrewgʰ- (“to enjoy”). Cognate with Dutch *bruiken* (“to use”), German *brauchen* (“to need, use”), Scots *bruik* (“to use, enjoy”).  The original sense was "to use," which evolved to "put up with," and then "tolerate."
