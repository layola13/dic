ethenoid:/ˈɛθɪnɔɪd/| adj.|乙烯基的，含雙鍵的|Relating to or denoting compounds containing the ethene (ethylene) structural unit, especially those containing a carbon-carbon double bond.|Ethenoid compounds are more reactive than their saturated counterparts. 乙烯化合物比它們的飽和化合物更具反應性。|The ethenoid linkage is susceptible to addition reactions. 乙烯基鍵易受加成反應影響。|近义词：unsaturated, olefinic|反义词：saturated|词性:adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From ethene + -oid.  Ethene itself comes from ethyl + -ene.  Ethyl is from ether + -yl, reflecting its earlier preparation from diethyl ether.  The suffix -ene denotes an unsaturated hydrocarbon, specifically an alkene.  The suffix -oid means "resembling" or "like."
