PHRASE->
N/A -  'Mosaically' is typically not used in set phrases.  It functions as an adverb describing *how* something is done, rather than forming a fixed expression with other words.  It's more contextually driven.


词源: From mosaic + -ly.  Mosaic ultimately comes from Latin *musaicum* (opus) "work of the Muses," because mosaics were considered a high art form.
