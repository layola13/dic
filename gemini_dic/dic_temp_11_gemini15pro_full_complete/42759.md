词源: "Country" comes from Old French "contree" from Vulgar Latin "(terra) contrata" meaning "(land) lying opposite," from Latin "contra" meaning "against." "Damaged" comes from the Old French "damager," from "damage," which ultimately derives from Latin "damnum," meaning "loss" or "harm."  This compound term indicates harm or loss specifically caused by a country's actions or policies.
