The program has been writing data to the outpath's for the last hour. = 程序过去一小时一直在将数据写入输出路径。
The system has been creating files in the outpath's all day. = 系统一整天都在输出路径中创建文件。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The script created the outpath's before writing the files. = 脚本在写入文件之前创建了输出路径。
The program wrote the log files to the outpath's yesterday. = 程序昨天将日志文件写入输出路径。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was writing to the outpath's when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，系统正在写入输出路径。
The program was creating the outpath's structure while processing the data. = 程序在处理数据时正在创建输出路径结构。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had already created the outpath's before the data processing started. = 在数据处理开始之前，程序已经创建了输出路径。
The script had written the files to the outpath's before the system crashed. = 系统崩溃之前，脚本已将文件写入输出路径。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been writing to the outpath's for several hours before the disk filled up. = 在磁盘填满之前，系统已经向输出路径写入几个小时了。
The program had been creating files in the outpath's all night before the process finished. = 在进程完成之前，程序整晚都在输出路径中创建文件。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The script will create the outpath's before writing the output. = 脚本将在写入输出之前创建输出路径。
The program will store the results in the specified outpath's. = 程序会将结果存储在指定的输出路径中。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be writing to the outpath's during the data processing. = 系统将在数据处理期间写入输出路径。
The program will be creating the necessary files in the outpath's tomorrow. = 程序明天将在输出路径中创建必要的文件。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the program will have written all the files to the outpath's. = 到明天，程序将把所有文件都写入输出路径。
The script will have created the outpath's by the time the processing begins. = 到处理开始时，脚本将已经创建了输出路径。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the system will have been writing data to the outpath's for a month. = 到下周，系统将已经向输出路径写入数据一个月了。
The program will have been storing results in the outpath's for a year by the time the project is complete. = 到项目完成时，程序将已经将结果存储在输出路径中一年了。


PHRASE->
specify the outpath's = 指定输出路径
create the outpath's = 创建输出路径
write to the outpath's = 写入输出路径
read from the outpath's = 从输出路径读取
check the outpath's = 检查输出路径


注意事项:

“outpath’s” 更常见且更正确的写法是 "output path" 或 "outpath" (没有撇号)。  撇号通常表示所有格，在这里使用不太合适，除非你想表达 “这个输出路径的东西”，例如 "the outpath's contents" (输出路径的内容)。  所以建议尽量避免使用 "outpath's"。
