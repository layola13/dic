ETYMOLOGY->
From late Middle English *flagraunt* "burning, blazing," from Old French *flagrant*  (present participle of *flagrer* "to burn, blaze") < Latin *flagrāns*, present participle of *flagrāre* "to burn, blaze." The figurative sense "glaring, scandalous" arose in the 16th century.  The noun *flagrantness* is derived from the adjective *flagrant* with the suffix *-ness*.
