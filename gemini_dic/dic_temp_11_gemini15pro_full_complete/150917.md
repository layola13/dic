##parallelization: /ˌpærəlelaɪˈzeɪʃən/并行化；并行处理time) by multiple processors or cores, thereby speeding up the overall processing time.  It's a key technique in high-performance computing, allowing for significantimprovements in efficiency for computationally intensive tasks.  The level of parallelization achievable depends on the nature of the task and the architecture of the system. For example, a task that inherently involves sequential steps cannot be fully parallelized; however, partsof it might still be parallelizable.* Modern computer architectures are designed to support the efficient parallelization of multiple processes. 现代计算机体系结构旨在支持多个进程的有效并行化。"parallelization" comes from the word "parallel," meaning "side by side," or more generally,  simultaneous or concurrent occurrence. The suffix "-ization" signifies the process of making something parallel.  The root word "parallel" traces back to the Greek words  *παρά* (*pará*) meaning"beside" and *ἀλλήλων* (*allēlōn*) meaning "one another".  Therefore, the etymological root signifies things occurring "beside one another," perfectly reflecting the concept of simultaneous or concurrent execution.noun nature of "parallelization," verb conjugations aren't directly applicable. However, we can illustrate usage in different sentence structures:depends on the level of parallelization. 系统的效率取决于并行化程度。的并行化。* We have implemented parallelization in our latest software update. 我们已经在最新的软件更新中实现了并行化。数月了。的并行化。。。.  在取得突破之前，他们已经实施并行化好几年了。improve the speed of our computations. 我们将实现并行化以提高计算速度。be testing the parallelization algorithms. 下周，我们将测试并行化算法。the year, we will have completed the parallelization of the entire system. 到年底，我们将完成整个系统的并行化。Continuous):**化对性能的影响十年了。
