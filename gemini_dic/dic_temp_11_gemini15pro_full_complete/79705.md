glucinic: /ɡluːˈsɪnɪk/ | adj. |  葡萄糖酸的；铍的 | Relating to or derived from glucose or glucinum (an old name for beryllium). | Glucinic acid is a crystalline acid obtained by the oxidation of glucose. 葡萄糖酸是一种通过葡萄糖氧化获得的结晶酸。|  The glucinic salts were used in early experiments. 葡萄糖酸盐被用于早期的实验中。| 近义词: beryllate (referring to beryllium) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *glucinique*, from glucose + -inique (equivalent to English -inic).  The term ultimately derives from Greek γλυκύς (glykýs, “sweet”).  The "glucinum" part refers to the sweet taste of some beryllium salts.
