The word "heyens" is not a recognized English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you meant a different word, please provide it and I will be happy to analyze it for you.

If you're interested in how new words are formed in English, I can provide information on that topic.  For example, new words can be created through:

* **Compounding:** Combining existing words (e.g., "sunshine," "keyboard").
* **Derivation:** Adding prefixes or suffixes to existing words (e.g., "unhappy," "quickly").
* **Borrowing:** Adopting words from other languages (e.g., "taco," "karaoke").
* **Acronyms:** Forming words from the initial letters of a phrase (e.g., "laser," "scuba").
* **Back-formation:** Creating a new word by removing a supposed affix from an existing word (e.g., "edit" from "editor").
* **Blending:** Combining parts of two words (e.g., "smog" from "smoke" and "fog").

Please let me know if you'd like to explore any of these processes further.
