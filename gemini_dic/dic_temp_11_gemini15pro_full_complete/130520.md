词源:  "Nonaccord" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "accord" (meaning "agreement" or "harmony").  "Accord" itself has roots in the Old French word "acort" and ultimately the Latin "accordare," meaning "to bring to the heart."  Therefore, "nonaccord" literally means "not in agreement."
