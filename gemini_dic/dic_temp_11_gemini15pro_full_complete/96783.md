近义词: asymmetrical, unequal
反义词: equivalvular, symmetrical
词性: adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + equi- (equal) + valv- (valve) + -ular (adjectival suffix).  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "equi-", indicating a lack of equality.  "Valv-" refers to a valve, and "-ular" forms an adjective meaning "relating to" or "having the form of."
