fractal:/ˈfræktəl/ | n. adj. |分形，分形的|A curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos.|The coastline of Britain is a good example of a fractal. |synonyms: fragmented, fractional, irregular |antonyms: smooth, regular |noun, adjective
