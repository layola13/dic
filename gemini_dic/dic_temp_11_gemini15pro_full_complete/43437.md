PHRASE->
(While grammatically correct, "craps's" is uncommon and awkward.  Phrases using "craps" are more natural.)

craps table: 双骰子赌博桌
craps game: 双骰子赌博游戏
play craps: 玩双骰子赌博
craps rules: 双骰子赌博规则
craps odds: 双骰子赌博赔率


注意事项:

While "craps's" is grammatically correct as the possessive form of "craps," it's very rarely used and sounds awkward. It's more natural to use "craps" followed by a prepositional phrase, like "the rules of craps" or "the table for craps."  This explains the somewhat contrived examples used above.  In real-world usage, rephrasing to avoid "craps's" is highly recommended.
