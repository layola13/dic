词源:
butlerlike is a combination of "butler" and the suffix "-like."  "Butler" comes from Old French *buteillier, meaning "bottle bearer," ultimately from Latin butticula "small bottle."  The suffix "-like" is of Old English origin, meaning "having the characteristics of."  Therefore, "butlerlike" literally means "having the characteristics of a butler."
