词源:  From Middle English *nib, *neb, from Old English nib (“beak, bill, nib, point”), from Proto-Germanic *nibą (“point, beak”). Cognate with Dutch nib (“nib”), German Nib (“nib”).

需要注意的是，nibs本身已经是复数形式，表示多个笔尖。nibs's 这种形式比较罕见，通常用 "the nibs of the pens" 或 "the pens' nibs" 来表示多支钢笔的笔尖。 尽管在语法上可以构成nibs's的所有格形式，但实际使用中很少见，建议使用其他表达方式。
