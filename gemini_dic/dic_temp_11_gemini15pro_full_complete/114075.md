magnetomotor:/ˌmæɡˌniːtəˈmoʊtər/ | adj. | 磁动势的 | Relating to or producing magnetomotive force. | The magnetomotor force is the driving force that produces magnetic flux. 磁动势是产生磁通量的驱动力。|  The strength of the magnetic field is directly proportional to the magnetomotor force. 磁场强度与磁动势成正比。 |近义词: magnetic | 反义词: non-magnetic | 词性: adjective


magnetomotive:/ˌmæɡˌniːtəˈmoʊtɪv/ | adj. | 磁通势的，磁动势的 | Producing or tending to produce magnetic flux. | The magnetomotive force is analogous to the electromotive force in an electric circuit. 磁通势类似于电路中的电动势。| The coil provides the magnetomotive force needed to create the magnetic field. 线圈提供产生磁场所需的磁通势。| 近义词: magnetomotor | 反义词: non-magnetic | 词性: adjective


**词源:**

"Magnetomotive" is derived from "magneto-" (relating to magnetism) + "motive" (causing motion).  The word element "magneto-" ultimately comes from the Greek "Magnēs lithos" meaning "Magnesian stone," referring to lodestone, a naturally magnetic mineral found in Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece.  "Motive" derives from Latin "motus," the past participle of "movēre," meaning "to move."
