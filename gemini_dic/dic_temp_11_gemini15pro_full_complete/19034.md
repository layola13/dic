ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *betechen*, from Old English *betǣcan* ("to show, demonstrate, point out, indicate, announce, entrust, commit, assign, bequeath"), from *be-* (intensifying prefix) + *tǣcan* ("to teach, show").  Cognate with German *bezeichnen* ("to mark, denote"). The passive form "be taught" developed naturally from this meaning.
