inable:/ɪˈneɪbl/ | adj. | 能的，可的 |  Not a standard word in modern English. Likely an archaic or poetic form meaning "able to be in" or "capable of being contained within."  Its meaning can be inferred from its components: "in" (within) + "able" (capable of).|  (No authentic examples exist in modern usage. Constructed example:) The inable spirit of hope resided within her heart.  希望的内在精神驻留在她的心中。 | 近义词: containable, admissible | 反义词: uncontainable, inadmissible | 词性: adjective

词源: From "in" + "able."  "In" comes from Old English "in," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*in," meaning "in, into, on, upon." "Able" comes from Old French "hable," from Latin "habilis" meaning "apt, fit, suitable," from "habere" meaning "to have, to hold."
