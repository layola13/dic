词源:  The origin of the word "Dixie" is uncertain. One popular theory traces it back to $10 banknotes issued in Louisiana before the Civil War. These notes bore the French word "dix" (ten) and became known as "dixies." Another theory suggests it comes from Jeremiah Dixon, a surveyor who helped draw the Mason-Dixon Line, a boundary between northern and southern states.
