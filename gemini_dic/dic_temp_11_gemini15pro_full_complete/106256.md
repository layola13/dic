"Knowleching" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) based on "knowledge."  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary definition.  However, if we assume it's intended to mean "the process of gaining knowledge" or "acknowledging something as knowledge," I can offer a hypothetical analysis:

knowledging: /ˈnɒlɪdʒɪŋ/ | n. | 获取知识; 承认…为知识 |  The act of acquiring knowledge or recognizing something as knowledge. | Example:  Knowledging the limitations of the study is crucial. 承认研究的局限性至关重要。| Synonym: learning, acknowledging, recognizing | Antonym: ignoring, denying | Noun
