ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English folc "people, nation, tribe, multitude; common people," related to Old Frisian folk, Old Saxon folc, Old High German folc, Old Norse folk "people, troops," Gothic fulks "people, nation, crowd."  The original sense was probably "host of warriors," and the word is cognate with Latin plebs "common people" and possibly with Greek plethos "multitude." The sense of "one's own people, family" is from c. 1200. The adjective use, meaning "of the common people," is from late 14c. The weakened sense of "people in general" is from 18c.
