ETYMOLOGY->
From grief + -less + -ness.  Grief comes from the Old French *grief* (modern French *grif*), from Late Latin *gravis* "heavy, weighty, serious," ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *gʷerə- (2)* "heavy."  The suffix *-less* indicates absence or lack of something.  The suffix *-ness* forms nouns expressing a state or quality.
