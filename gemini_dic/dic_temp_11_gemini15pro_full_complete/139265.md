注意事项:

This word, "obligingness's," while grammatically possible (as a possessive form of "obligingness"), is extremely rare and awkward.  It's highly recommended to rephrase to avoid its use.  For instance, instead of "the obligingness's of the staff," use "the staff's obligingness" or "the obliging nature of the staff."
