词源：From Old Norse *litr, "color, dye, appearance".  Originally referred to straw used as bedding for animals, which would become mixed with their droppings.  This sense evolved to mean the mixture itself, and later to any scattered rubbish.  The sense of a group of offspring born at the same time comes from the animals sharing the same bedding.
