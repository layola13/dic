overdiverse:/ˌoʊvərdaɪˈvɜːrs/ | adj. | 过于多样化的；过度多样化的 | Excessively diverse; having too much diversity.  Characterized by a level of biodiversity that is considered higher than optimal or sustainable for a given ecosystem.  Often implies a situation where the high diversity might lead to instability or other negative consequences. | The overdiverse ecosystem, paradoxically, proved fragile and prone to collapse. 这个过于多样化的生态系统，反常地表现出脆弱和容易崩溃的倾向。

The rainforest, while overdiverse in terms of plant species, had a surprisingly low number of large mammals. 这片雨林，虽然在植物种类方面过于多样化，但大型哺乳动物的数量却少得惊人。| 近义词: excessively diverse, hyperdiverse | 反义词: homogeneous, uniform,  monotonous | 词性: 形容词
