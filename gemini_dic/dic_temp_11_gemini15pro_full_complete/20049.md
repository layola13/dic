biophotophone:/ˌbaɪoʊˈfoʊtəˌfoʊn/ | n. |生物光电话| An instrument for transmitting speech along a beam of light, using the effect of voice vibrations on a sensitive flame or other light source. It converts sound vibrations into fluctuations in light intensity, allowing for the transmission of speech or other audio signals over a light beam.  | Example: Alexander Graham Bell's biophotophone was a precursor to fiber optic communication.  亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔的生物光电话是光纤通信的先驱。 | Example: The biophotophone, though innovative, was limited by its reliance on clear lines of sight. 尽管生物光电话具有创新性，但它受限于其对清晰视线的依赖。| Synonym: photophone | Antonym: N/A | noun
