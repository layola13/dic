词源:
Originating in the late 19th century, "duds" likely comes from the word "dude," which initially referred to a dandy or fop, someone overly concerned with their appearance. Their elaborate clothes, if they went out of style, could be considered "duds."  Another theory suggests it's related to the term "dud" for an unexploded bomb or firework, implying something useless or ineffective.
