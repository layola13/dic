词源:  The origin of "cadgy" is uncertain, but it is likely related to "cad," meaning a dishonest or unscrupulous man.  The connection might be that a cad would be nervously cautious, fearing discovery.  Another possible link is to the Scottish word "cadgie," meaning cheerful or lively, which could have ironically evolved into its current meaning.
