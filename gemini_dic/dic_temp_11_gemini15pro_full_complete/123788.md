ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *mōt (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *mōtam (compare Old Frisian mōt "meeting, court," Old Saxon mōt "meeting, court, council," Old High German muot "meeting, assembly, council," German Muth "courage, spirit," Gothic 𐌼𐍉𐍄𐍃 (mōts) "toll, custom-house"), from Proto-Indo-European *mē- (compare Latin metiri "to measure, allot," Greek μέτρον (métron) "measure").  The original sense was "assembly, meeting," later evolving to "subject of discussion" and the verb meaning "to discuss."
