词源:  From Middle English *mamed, from Old English *ġe-mādmian (“to marry, give in marriage”), related to Old English mādm (“marriage gift, dowry”) and Old Norse meiða (“to hurt, injure”).  More distantly related to Old English map (“treasure, reward”).  The original sense seems to have been "provided with a marriage portion".  The modern spelling is influenced by "married."
