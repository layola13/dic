PHRASE->
(Not applicable. "Continualnesses" is not commonly used in phrases.  Its singular form, "continualness," is already a noun representing a state of being, making it less likely to be part of fixed phrases.)


注意事项:  The word "continualnesses" is grammatically correct but extremely rare and awkward.  "Continuity" or "continuance" are much more common and natural choices.
