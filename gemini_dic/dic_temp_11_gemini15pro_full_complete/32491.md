注意事项:
* "Chingo" is considered vulgar slang and should be avoided in formal settings.  Its usage can be offensive to some.  Consider your audience before using it.
* While primarily used in the Southwest US and areas with a significant Latino population, its usage is spreading. However, it is not universally understood.


词源:  Derived from Mexican Spanish, likely related to the Spanish word "chingar" (to fuck, to bother, to mess with), though the exact etymology is debated.  It acts as an intensifier, indicating a large quantity.
