词源: From gutsy + -ly. Gutsy (adjective) means having guts; brave and determined.  It originates from "guts" which originally referred to the bowels, and later came to be associated with courage and fortitude (perhaps because strong emotions are felt in the gut).  The suffix "-ly" is commonly used to form adverbs from adjectives.
