词源: From the adjective "conceited" + "-ly" (adverbial suffix). "Conceited" comes from the verb "conceit," meaning "to form a concept or idea," which in turn comes from the Old French "conceit" and ultimately from the Latin "concipere" (to conceive).  The meaning shifted over time to imply an excessive focus on one's own ideas and thus, excessive pride.
