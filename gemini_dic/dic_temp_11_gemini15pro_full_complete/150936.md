```| 旁系同源 | The evolutionary relationship between two genes within the samespecies that have arisen through duplication of a single ancestral gene.  Paralogy refers to homologous genes that have diverged after a gene duplication event within a genome.This contrasts with orthology, where homologous genes are found in different species due to speciation.  | Example: The alpha and beta globin genes are paralogs, having arisen from a gene duplication event.  α球蛋白基因和β球蛋白基因是旁系同源基因，它们起源于一次基因复制事件。 | 近义词: homology (同源性), gene duplication(基因复制) | 反义词: orthology (直系同源) | 名词beside" or "alongside," and "logos" (λόγος), meaning "word," "reason," or "proportion."  In the context of biology, "para" suggests a relationship of similarity alongside the main line of descent, reflecting the branching evolution arising from gene duplication.single genome.  These duplicates might then diverge in function over evolutionary time, leading to new functionalities or specialized roles.in predicting their function, as they often retain some degree of similarity to their ancestral gene.. **Describing genetic relationships:** "The analysis revealed that gene X and gene Y are paralogs, indicating a gene duplication event sometime during the evolution of species Z."precise control."arose from a common ancestor through speciation.  In contrast, paralogy describes the relationship between genes within the *same* species that arose from a duplication event within that species’ genome.  Both concepts are important for understanding evolutionary relationships, with orthology primarily used in tracking the ancestral relationship across species, while paralogy tracksthe evolutionary diversification of genes within a single lineage.
