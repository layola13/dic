The word "ekara" doesn't appear to be a valid word in English or any common language.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it could be a word from a less common language. Please double-check the spelling or provide more context (such as the language it's from).

Since I can't analyze "ekara", I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | used to ask for information about something; used to ask for repetition of something not heard or understood; used to express surprise or disbelief | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Example: What did you say? 你说什么？ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for 'what') | Word type: Interrogative
