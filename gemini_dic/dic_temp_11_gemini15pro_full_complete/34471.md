词源: "clawers" is a plural form derived from "claw," which comes from the Old English "clawu," related to the Old High German "klāwa" and the Latin "glūma" (husk, shell).  The "-er" suffix is less common for creating plurals but can be found in some dialects or informal usage.  It typically implies a more active or agentive sense, sometimes suggesting repeated or habitual action, although in this case it primarily functions as a plural marker.
