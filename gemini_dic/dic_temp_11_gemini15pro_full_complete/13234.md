词源: 
"Ataunto" is likely derived from Spanish "a tanto," meaning "to such an extent" or "so much." It suggests a level of capability or sufficiency.  However, it's important to note that "ataunto" is not a standard English word and its usage is limited.  It might be considered archaic or regional.  Using more common synonyms like "capable," "competent," or "adequate" is generally recommended in modern English.
