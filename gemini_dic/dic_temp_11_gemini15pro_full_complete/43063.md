注意事项:
“cowo” itself doesn't have a formally recognized etymology. It's likely derived as a playful or misspelled variation of "comrade," "crew," or even "co-worker," adapted for online gaming and social contexts. It's crucial to remember that this term is informal and primarily used online.  Using it in formal settings might be misunderstood.
