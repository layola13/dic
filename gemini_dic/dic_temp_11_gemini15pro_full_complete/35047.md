closedai:/kloʊzd eɪˈaɪ/ | n. | 封闭式人工智能 | A hypothetical type of artificial intelligence system that operates within a restricted environment and with limited access to external information.  It contrasts with open AI, which can interact more freely with the world. | Example: A closed AI might be trained to play a specific game with a fixed set of rules, but it wouldn't be able to learn or adapt to new games or rules without being explicitly reprogrammed.  封闭式人工智能可能被训练玩具有固定规则的特定游戏，但如果没有明确的重新编程，它将无法学习或适应新的游戏或规则。 | Example:  Some researchers argue that closed AI systems are inherently safer than open AI systems, as their behavior is more predictable and controllable. 一些研究人员认为，封闭式人工智能系统本质上比开放式人工智能系统更安全，因为它们的行为更可预测和可控。 | 近义词: restricted AI, contained AI | 反义词: open AI, general AI | 词性: noun
