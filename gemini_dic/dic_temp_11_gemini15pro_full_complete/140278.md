注意事项:

"Oft" is an archaic word and less commonly used in modern English.  "Often" is the more common and preferred term.  While grammatically correct in all the tenses demonstrated, it sounds stilted and unnatural in some, particularly the continuous tenses.  It's best used in formal writing or for stylistic effect to create a sense of old-fashioned language.
