Etymology:  Likely originating in the late 19th century, "honky-tonk" initially referred to noisy, often disreputable saloons or variety shows, particularly in the American West and South.  The exact origin is uncertain, but some theories suggest it may be imitative of the sound of the pianos or other instruments played in such establishments.  Another theory connects it to the name of a saloon in Fort Worth, Texas.
