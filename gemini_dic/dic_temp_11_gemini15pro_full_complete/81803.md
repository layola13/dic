词源:
From Spanish *granado "pomegranate," from Latin *granatum "having many seeds," from granum "seed, grain."  So called because the early grenades resembled pomegranates in shape and because they were filled with small pellets.  来自西班牙语 *granado “石榴”，源于拉丁语 *granatum “多籽的”，来自 granum “种子，谷物”。之所以这样称呼，是因为早期的榴弹在形状上类似于石榴，并且里面装满了小弹丸。
