The word "obuncous" does not exist in the English language.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a proper lexical analysis.  If you meant a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist you.

For example, if you perhaps meant "obnoxious," here's the analysis:

obnoxious: /əbˈnɑːkʃəs/ | adj. | 令人讨厌的；可憎的 | Extremely unpleasant. |  Example: His obnoxious behavior made it difficult to like him. 他的讨厌行为让人很难喜欢他。| Example: The obnoxious smell of the garbage permeated the entire alley. 垃圾令人作呕的气味弥漫了整条小巷。 | Synonyms: offensive, repugnant, disagreeable, unpleasant | Antonyms: pleasant, agreeable, delightful, charming | Word Type: Adjective
