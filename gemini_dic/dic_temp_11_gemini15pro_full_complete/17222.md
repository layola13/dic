ETYMOLOGY -> From Middle English *baude, from Old French baude (feminine of baus “joyful, merry”), from Frankish *bald “bold, brave,” from Proto-Germanic *balþaz “bold, strong, brave.”  The semantic shift from “bold” to “procuress” likely occurred through association with the idea of brazen or shameless behavior.
