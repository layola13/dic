ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *directionalis, from Latin directionem (nominative directio) "a straightening, a direction," from dirigere "to direct," from dis- "apart" (see dis-) + regere "to guide, rule" (from PIE root *reg- "move in a straight line," with derivatives meaning "to direct in a straight line," thus "to lead, rule").
