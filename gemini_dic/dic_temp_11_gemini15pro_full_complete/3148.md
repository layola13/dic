ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *āgan "to own, possess," related to Old Norse eiga, Old High German eigan, Gothic aigan.  The form "aet" likely represents a dialectal or archaic variant.  Its use as a noun meaning "schedule" or "diary" may have developed from the idea of possessing or keeping a record.
