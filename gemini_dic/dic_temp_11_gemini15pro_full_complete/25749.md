ETYMOLOGY->
From French *bourbain*, from Old French *borber*, meaning "to plow a field," from Late Latin *burbare*, ultimately from Gaulish.  The original sense referred to the land outside a walled city or town, hence "suburban." The negative connotations of "dull" and "conventional" developed later.
