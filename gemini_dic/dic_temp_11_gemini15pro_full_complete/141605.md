opsonization:/ˌɒpsənaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |調理作用，調理現象 | The process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte.  This is achieved by coating the pathogen with opsonins. |  Opsonization is crucial for effective immune responses against bacterial infections. 調理作用對於有效應對細菌感染的免疫反應至關重要。|  近义词: immune adherence | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but a lack of opsonization would hinder phagocytosis) | noun
