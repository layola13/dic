注意事项:

"Cancelier" is primarily used in French.  The English equivalent is "cancel,"  though "cancelier" might be seen in very specific legal or historical contexts relating to French law or history.  This analysis focuses on the French usage.  The English word "chancellor" is a different word altogether and is not etymologically related to "cancel."
