nitrosaccharin: /ˌnaɪtroʊˈsækərɪn/ | n. | 硝基糖精 | An artificial sweetener derived from saccharin by nitration.  It's significantly sweeter than saccharin but raises concerns about potential health risks and is generally not used commercially. |  Studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of nitrosaccharin consumption. 需要研究来确定长期食用硝基糖精的影响。 |  synonyms:  (No direct synonyms as it's a very specific chemical compound. Could potentially list other artificial sweeteners like "sucralose," "aspartame," or "cyclamate" depending on the context but these are not chemically similar) | antonyms: (No direct antonyms) | noun
