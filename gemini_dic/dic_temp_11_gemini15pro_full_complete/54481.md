PHRASE->
(Due to the infrequent usage of "disinterestedness's" in possessive form, common phrases are difficult to establish. It's more common to see phrases using "disinterestedness" itself.)

注意事项:
"Disinterestedness's" is grammatically correct but rarely used.  Using "disinterestedness" without the possessive 's is much more common and natural.  Avoid using the possessive form unless absolutely necessary for clarity and consider rephrasing if possible.
