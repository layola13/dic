antherozoid: /ˌænθərˈəʊzɔɪd/ | n. | 游动精子；精子 | A motile male gamete of algae, fungi, bryophytes, pteridophytes, and some gymnosperms.  It is typically flagellated and swims through water to reach the female gamete (egg). | Example 1: The antherozoids of the fern swim towards the archegonium.  蕨类的游动精子游向颈卵器。

Example 2:  Researchers studied the movement of the antherozoids under a microscope. 研究人员在显微镜下研究了游动精子的运动。 | Synonym: sperm, spermatozoid | Antonym: egg, ovum | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From New Latin *antherozoīdes, from Ancient Greek ἀνθήρ (anthḗr, “flower, bloom”) + ζωή (zōḗ, “life”) + -oid.

Past Perfect Continuous:
Example 1: The scientists had been observing the antherozoids for hours before they finally witnessed fertilization. 科学家们观察了几个小时的游动精子，最终才目睹了受精过程。
Example 2:  The antherozoids had been swimming actively before reaching the archegonium. 游动精子在到达颈卵器之前一直活跃地游动。


Simple Future:
Example 1: The researchers will study the antherozoids of other fern species next week. 研究人员下周将研究其他蕨类物种的游动精子。
Example 2: The fern will release its antherozoids when the conditions are right. 当条件合适时，蕨类植物会释放它的游动精子。
