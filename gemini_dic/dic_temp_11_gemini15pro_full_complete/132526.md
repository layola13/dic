nondevelopable:/ˌnɒndɪˈvɛləpəbl/ | adj. | 不可展的，不可展开的 | Not capable of being developed; incapable of being expanded or unfolded into a plane surface without distortion. |  This curved surface is nondevelopable. 这个曲面是不可展的。| The artist struggled with the nondevelopable material.  这位艺术家与不可展开的材料作斗争。 |近义词：unexpandible, non-expandable |反义词: developable, expandable |词性: 形容词

Etymology:
non- (prefix):  from Latin *non "not"
developable (adjective): from develop (verb) + -able (suffix). Develop comes from Old French desveloper "to unwrap, unfold," from des- "un-, out" + voloper "to wrap." -able comes from Old French -able and directly from Latin -abilis.
