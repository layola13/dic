ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *articulaten*, from Latin articulātus, past participle of articulāre (“to utter distinctly, joint”), from articulus (“joint, division, small part”), diminutive of artus (“joint, limb”).  The sense development is from "having joints" to "uttering distinctly, as if separating sounds like joints".
