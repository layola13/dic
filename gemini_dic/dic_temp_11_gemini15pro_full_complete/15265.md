ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *bakking*, from *bakken* (“to bake”), from Old Norse *baka* (“to bake”).  The sense of "support" likely developed from the idea of something providing a solid foundation or "backing," like the back of an object. The musical sense arose from the idea of a band "backing up" a singer.
