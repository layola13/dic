ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *Epicurēus, from Ancient Greek Ἐπίκουρος (Epíkouros, “Epicurus”), the name of a Greek philosopher who advocated moderate pleasure as the highest good.  The original philosophy of Epicurus was not focused on excessive indulgence, but rather on the avoidance of pain and the pursuit of simple pleasures. Over time, the meaning of "epicurean" has shifted to denote a love of luxury and sensual gratification, especially in food and drink.
