词源：The phrase "ivory tower" comes from the biblical Song of Solomon 7:4, which describes a woman's neck as being "like an ivory tower."  Later, it was used by French poet and critic Sainte-Beuve to describe the poet Alfred de Vigny's seclusion and detachment from the world.  The phrase eventually gained its current meaning of being out of touch with reality.
