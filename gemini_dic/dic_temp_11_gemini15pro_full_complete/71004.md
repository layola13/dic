The word "firids" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. 

However, if you meant "finds," I can offer the following:

finds /faɪndz/ | n. | 发现物; 发现，发现的东西 |  These archaeological finds are incredibly important.  这些考古发现非常重要。| finds: discoveries, results |  losses | noun

finds /faɪndz/ | v. | (find的第三人称单数形式) 发现; 找到; 认为; 感觉到 | He finds the work very tiring. 他觉得这份工作很累人。 | finds: discovers, locates, unearths | loses, misses | verb
