amphitropous:/æmˈfɪtrəpəs/
adjective
倒生的，双向的
(of an ovule) inverted so that the micropyle and funicle are close together.
Example: The amphitropous ovule is curved in such a way that the micropyle and funicle are nearly parallel.  倒生的胚珠弯曲的方式使珠孔和珠柄几乎平行。

Example:  Amphitropous ovules are commonly found in certain families of flowering plants.  倒生胚珠常见于某些开花植物科。
Synonym:  anatropous, campylotropous (related but distinct ovule orientations)
Antonym:  orthotropous (straight ovule orientation)
词性: adjective
