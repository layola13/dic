Etymology: From alcohol + -ist. "Alcohol" comes from Medieval Latin alcohol, from Arabic al-kuḥl "kohl," originally a fine metallic powder used as eye makeup. The sense was extended to "essence" or "spirit," and eventually to "spirits of wine." The suffix "-ist" denotes a person who practices or is devoted to something.
