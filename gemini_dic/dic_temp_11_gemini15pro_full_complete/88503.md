Etymology:

"historionomer" is likely a blend of "historian" and "astronomer".  "Historian" comes from the Old French "historie," ultimately from the Latin "historia," meaning "narrative, account, tale, story," derived from the Greek "historia" meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation." "Astronomer" comes from the Old French "astronomie," from Latin "astronomia," and ultimately from Greek "astronomia,"  from "astron" (star) + "nomos" (law, arrangement). The blending of these two words suggests a focus on history with a potentially meticulous, scientific approach, perhaps reminiscent of the study of celestial movements and cycles.
