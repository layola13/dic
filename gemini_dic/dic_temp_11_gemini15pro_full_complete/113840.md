ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb phrase "make up," meaning to create or invent something (often a story or excuse).  The past participle "made-up" then became an adjective describing something that has been created or invented, hence "fictitious" or "fabricated."  It also gained a separate meaning related to cosmetics, referring to a face with makeup applied.
