atropism: /ˈæt.rə.pɪ.zəm/ | n. | 向性，趋向性 | The turning or growth movement of a living organism, especially a plant, in response to an external stimulus such as light, gravity, or chemicals. |  The sunflower exhibits positive phototropism, meaning its head turns towards the sun.  向日葵表现出正向光性，这意味着它的头转向太阳。

The roots of a plant show positive gravitropism, growing downwards towards the pull of gravity. 植物的根表现出正向重力性，向下生长朝向重力拉的方向。 | synonyms: tropism, orientation, turning | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but one could consider random growth) | noun
