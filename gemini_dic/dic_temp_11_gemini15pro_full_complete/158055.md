##plasma:/ˈplæz.mə/| n. |等离子体，血浆|Plasma is a state of matter similar to gas, but where a significant portion of the atoms are ionized (have lost or gained electrons).  It's characterizedby the presence of freely moving ions and electrons, which makes it highly conductive.  In the context of biology, plasma refers to the liquid component of blood thatcarries blood cells.(血浆含有蛋白质、葡萄糖和其他重要物质。)**反义词:**  无直接反义词，但可以根据语境考虑与“固体”、“液体”、“气体” 的对比。Its use in physics to describe this state of matter was coined by Irving Langmuir in the 1920s, due to its resemblance to the molded or formed nature of visible light.  The biological use stems from its role as the liquid component carrying formed cellular elements (blood cells).The word "plasma" can be used in a variety of contexts, primarily in physics and biology:etching in semiconductor manufacturing.usage across different contexts:to check for any abnormalities." (医生开具了血浆化验单，以检查是否有任何异常。)"Solar flares are massive eruptions of plasma and energy from the Sun's surface." (太阳耀斑是来自太阳表面的等离子体和能量的大规模爆发。), antonyms, and etymology.  The examples focus on showing the word in different contexts and illustrating its dual usage in physics and biology.
