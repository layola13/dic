antimechanism:/ˌæntiˈmɛkənɪzəm/| n.|反机械论|A philosophical doctrine that opposes mechanism, especially in its tendency to explain biological phenomena by reference to physical and chemical laws alone. It emphasizes the role of vital or purposive forces in nature. |Biologists who favoured antimechanism pointed to the capacity of living things for self-regulation and self-reproduction as evidence against purely mechanistic explanations. 生物学家们赞成反机械论，他们指出生物的自我调节和自我繁殖能力，以此作为反对纯粹机械解释的证据。|  vitalism, teleology| mechanism, reductionism| noun

antimechanistic:/ˌæntiˌmɛkəˈnɪstɪk/| adj.|反机械论的|Opposed to or rejecting mechanism, especially in the explanation of biological phenomena. |His antimechanistic views led him to believe in a vital force that animates living organisms. 他的反机械论观点使他相信有一种生命力使生物体具有活力。| vitalistic, teleological| mechanistic, reductionistic| adjective
