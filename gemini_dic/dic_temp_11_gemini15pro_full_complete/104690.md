karyostenosis:/ˌkærioʊstəˈnoʊsɪs/| n. |核固缩，核浓缩|The shrinking or condensation of the cell nucleus, often observed in dying cells.  This can be a normal part of cell death (apoptosis) or can be caused by disease or external factors.|例句：Karyostenosis was observed in the tissue samples exposed to the toxin. 在暴露于毒素的组织样本中观察到核固缩。

例句：The pathologist noted karyostenosis in the cancerous cells. 病理学家注意到癌细胞中的核固缩。|近义词：pyknosis|反义词:karyolysis|词性:noun
