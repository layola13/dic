inbeaming: /ɪnˈbiːmɪŋ/ | adj. | 灌注的，照耀的 |  Radiating inward; directing or transmitting (light, energy, etc.) into something.  This word is not commonly used and likely a neologism or a specialized term. It's formed from "in-" (into) and "beaming" (emitting beams of light or energy). |  The scientist described an *inbeaming* process that infused the crystal with energy. 科学家描述了一个向晶体注入能量的过程。| 近义词: infusing, irradiating, imbuing | 反义词: extracting, draining | 词性: 形容词
