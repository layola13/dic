##oxamic: 详细解析/ | adj. | 草酰胺的；草酰氨基的 |Oxamic refers to compounds containing the oxamic acid group (-CONH-COOH). This group is characterized by an amide (-CONH-) linked to a carboxyl group (-COOH).  Oxamic acid itself is the simplest compound in this class.  | Example: Oxamic acid derivatives are used in various chemical syntheses.  草酰胺酸衍生物用于各种化学合成。| 近义词: oxalamidic (though less common) | 反义词:  None directly opposite, but terms describing compounds *without* the oxamic acidgroup could be considered indirect opposites depending on the context. | adj.and "-amic," a suffix used to denote the amide related to a given acid. Oxalic acid itself derives from the Greek word "oxalis," meaning "sorrel," a plant from which oxalic acid was first isolated. Hence, the name reflects the chemical connection to oxalic acid, indicating a structural resemblance andderivative nature.You would encounter this term in research papers, chemical textbooks, and technical documentation related to organic chemistry or materials science where compounds with this specific functional group are discussed.The synthesis of N-substituted oxamic acid derivatives involves several steps. N-取代草酰胺酸衍生物的合成涉及几个步骤。derivatives is key to understanding oxamic compounds. Oxalic acid ($HOOC-COOH$) is a dicarboxylic acid, meaning it contains two carboxyl groups.  Oxamic acid ($H_2NCO-COOH$), on the other hand, replaces one of these carboxyl groups with an amide, forming theoxamic acid group.  Various other oxamic acid derivatives exist through modifications to the amide nitrogen or the remaining carboxyl group.the scientific domain and helps differentiate it from related chemical terms.
