ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *desconfit*, past participle of *desconfire* "to defeat, rout, undo," from *des-* "expressing reversal" + *confire* "to preserve, pickle, prepare, adorn, accomplish," from Latin *conficere* "to do, make, finish, complete." The sense shifted from "defeat in battle" to "frustrate, thwart" to "disconcert, embarrass."
