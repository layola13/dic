Etymology: From Middle English *churlishnes, from churlish + -ness.  Churlish itself comes from Old English *ceorlisc, meaning "of or pertaining to a peasant," from ceorl "peasant, freeman of the lowest rank."  The word's meaning degraded over time to signify a lack of manners associated with the perceived lower classes.
