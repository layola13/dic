ETYMOLOGY->
From French *fétichiste*, from Portuguese *feitiço* "charm, sorcery, witchcraft," alteration (influenced by *feito* "deed, fact") of Latin *facticius* "artificial, made by art," from *facere* "to make, do."  The sense shifted from "object of superstitious veneration" to "object of irrational devotion" in the late 19th century.
