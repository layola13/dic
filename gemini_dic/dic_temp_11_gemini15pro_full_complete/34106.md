词源：
The suffix "-ize" (and its British English variant "-ise") comes from the Greek suffix "-ίζειν" (-izein), which was used to form verbs.  It passed into Latin as "-izāre," and from there into French as "-iser."  The suffix eventually entered English, sometimes through French and sometimes directly from Latin or Greek.
