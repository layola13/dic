ETYMOLOGY->
"off" (adv., prep.) Old English "of," from Proto-Germanic "*af" (source also of Old Norse "af," Old Frisian "of," Dutch "af," German "ab" "off, from, down"), from PIE root "*apo" "off, away."
"tackle" (n.) late 14c., "equipment, apparatus, gear," from Middle Low German "takel" "rope, cord, rigging of a ship," from Middle Dutch "takel," probably from a PIE root meaning "to weave, construct." The sporting sense "act of seizing and stopping an opponent" is from 1889.
