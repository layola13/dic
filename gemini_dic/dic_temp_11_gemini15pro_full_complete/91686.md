hypercomposite:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɒmpəzɪt/ | adj. | 超合数的 |  A hypercomposite number is a positive integer which has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.  It's a concept in number theory related to highly composite numbers. | The number 12 is a hypercomposite number because it has six divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12), which is more than any smaller positive integer. | Synonyms: Highly composite (related, but not identical) | Antonyms: Prime (in a broad sense, as primes have the fewest divisors) | Adjective

Etymology:
"Hyper-" (Greek): over, above, beyond
"Composite" (Latin compositus, past participle of componere): put together, compound
