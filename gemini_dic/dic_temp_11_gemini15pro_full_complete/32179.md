注意事项:
Chiaro is primarily used in Italian. While it can be understood by English speakers familiar with Romance languages, it's not a common English word.  It's best used in contexts where Italian words are appropriate, such as musical terminology or discussions of Italian art and culture.  Otherwise, using the English equivalent "clear" is recommended.
