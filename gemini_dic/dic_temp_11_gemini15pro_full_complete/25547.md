词源：
"Bullyrock" is likely a combination of "bully" and "rock."  "Bully" meaning someone who uses superior strength to intimidate others, and "rock" possibly referring to a hard, unyielding nature, or perhaps implying a physical size and strength like a rock.  It's likely a colloquial or regional term, as it's not widely documented in standard dictionaries.
