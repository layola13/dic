ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *creke*, from Old Norse *kriki* ("corner, nook, bend"), from Proto-Germanic *krekiz* ("bend, turn").  Cognate with Dutch *kreek* ("creek, inlet"), German *Krick* ("small stream"). The sense of "small stream" likely developed from the winding nature of such waterways.
