ETYMOLOGY->
This idiom likely originates from the idea of a road bending out of sight, implying a loss of direction or sanity.  The "bend" refers to a curve or turn in the road.  Someone who is "around the bend" is thought to have gone beyond the point of clear thinking or rational behavior, metaphorically disappearing around the curve of reason.
