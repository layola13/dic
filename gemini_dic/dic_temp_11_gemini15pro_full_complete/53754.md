ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *desconfit*, past participle of *desconfire* "to defeat, rout," from *des-* "expressing reversal" + *confire* "to preserve, pickle," from Latin *conficere* "to accomplish, complete, execute, finish, make, produce."  The original sense was "to undo, defeat utterly," which evolved to mean "to frustrate the plans of." The modern sense of "to embarrass" emerged in the 16th century.
