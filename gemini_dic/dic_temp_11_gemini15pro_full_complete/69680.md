词源: From Old English *fandian, *fendan "to try, test, tempt, put to the test; provide, furnish," from Proto-Germanic *fandijanan "to try, tempt" (source also of Old Frisian fandia "to tempt," Old Saxon fandōn, Old High German fantōn "to try, examine," German fahnden "to search, investigate," Gothic fandian "to try, tempt").


注意事项: fends是fend的第三人称单数形式。虽然fend本身可以是及物动词或不及物动词，但fends永远是及物动词。
