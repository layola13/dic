注意事项:
While grammatically correct in some contexts, the possessive form "ease's" is infrequent.  Using "of ease" is generally preferred.  For example, "the feeling of ease" is more common than "the ease's feeling."  Also, the contracted form "ease's" (for "ease is") is very rare and should be avoided in formal writing.
