词源:
From earlier *garnysshen, from Anglo-French *garniss-, present participle stem of garnir (“to furnish, equip, garnish”), from Frankish *warnjan, from Proto-Germanic *warnōną (“to furnish, provide, warn”). Cognate with Old High German warnōn (“to warn, admonish, provide for, furnish”). More at warn.  The meaning shifted from "furnished, adorned" to "over-decorated" and then to "gaudily or tastelessly decorated."
