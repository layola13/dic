词源：From Middle English *mislom, from mis- + lom (“tool, instrument, utensil”), from Old Norse lǫm.  Related to loom.  Originally a misunderstanding about the proper use of a tool.  Meaning generalized to any misunderstanding.  (This etymology is conjectural, as *mislom is not attested. However, it's a plausible reconstruction based on the meaning and similar formations.)
