注意事项:
The word "nymphet" is highly controversial and its usage should be approached with extreme caution due to its association with the sexualization of minors.  It is generally considered inappropriate and potentially offensive to use this term to describe a real child.  Its primary usage remains within the context of literary analysis and discussions of Nabokov's work.  使用“nymphet”这个词语极具争议性，由于它与未成年人的性化有关，因此使用时应格外谨慎。用这个词来形容一个真正的孩子通常被认为是不合适的，而且可能会冒犯他人。它的主要用途仍然是在文学分析和讨论纳博科夫作品的语境中。
