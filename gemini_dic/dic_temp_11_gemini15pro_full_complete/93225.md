YHWH/ˈjɑːhweɪ (Yahweh) or /ˈdʒiːhoʊvə (Jehovah)/ | n. |耶和华，上帝| The Tetragrammaton, the four Hebrew letters (יהוה‎) representing the personal name of God in the Hebrew Bible.  It is considered too sacred to be pronounced by many Jewish traditions, and is often substituted with "Adonai" (Lord) or "HaShem" (The Name). The pronunciation "Yahweh" is a scholarly reconstruction based on ancient texts and linguistic analysis. The pronunciation "Jehovah" arose from combining the vowels of "Adonai" with the consonants of YHWH.| Example:  Many religious scholars believe "Yahweh" is the most accurate pronunciation of God's name. 许多宗教学者认为“Yahweh”是上帝名字最准确的发音。

Example: The Tetragrammaton, YHWH, appears throughout the Hebrew Bible. 四字神名YHWH遍布希伯来圣经。| 近义词: God, Lord, The Almighty | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Noun
