"angusticlave" is a relatively recent word, likely coined in the late 20th or early 21st century. It combines "angusti-" (from Latin "angustus," meaning "narrow" or "confined") with "-clave," a suffix derived from "clavis" (Latin for "key"), often used to denote an enclosed space or chamber (as in "conclave").
