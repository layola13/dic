dolichocephalism:/ˌdɒlɪkoʊˈsɛfəlɪzəm/ /ˌdɑːlɪkoʊˈsɛfəlɪzəm/| n. | 长头畸形 |  A condition where the head is longer than would be expected, relative to its width.  It's characterized by a cephalic index (the ratio of the maximum width of the head to its maximum length) of less than 75. |  Dolichocephalism can be a normal variation in head shape, but it can also be associated with certain genetic disorders. 长头畸形可以是头部形状的正常变异，但也可能与某些遗传疾病有关。 | Example: The archaeologist noted the dolichocephalism evident in the ancient skull. 考古学家注意到古代头骨明显的长头畸形。| Synonym: long-headedness | Antonym: brachycephalism | noun
