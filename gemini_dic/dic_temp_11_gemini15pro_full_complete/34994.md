ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *cloistre*, from Latin claustrum "lock, bolt, bar, barrier," also "monastery, convent" (source also of Italian chiostro, Spanish claustro), from claudere "to shut, close."  The original sense of "monastery or convent" is now obsolete. The modern meaning developed from the seclusion associated with monastic life.
