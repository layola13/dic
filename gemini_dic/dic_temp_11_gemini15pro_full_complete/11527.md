arimed: /əˈraɪmd/ | adj. | 武装的；装备的 | Equipped with weapons; armed. |  The soldiers were arimed and ready for battle. 士兵们全副武装，准备战斗。| Synonyms: armed, equipped, outfitted | Antonyms: unarmed, defenseless | adjective

Etymology: From Old French *arimer, from a- (prefix meaning "to") + rime ("row," "line," "series"), implying arranging in a line or order for battle, hence "to equip."  The meaning shifted over time to specifically refer to equipping with weapons.
