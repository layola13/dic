nongases:/ˈnɒnˌɡæsɪz/ | n. | 非气体 | Substances that are not in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure. |  The nongases in the mixture settled to the bottom. 混合物中的非气体沉淀到底部。| synonyms: solids, liquids | antonyms: gases | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From "non-" (not) + "gases" (plural of gas).  "Non-" is a prefix of Latin origin meaning "not." "Gas" ultimately derives from the Greek word "khaos" meaning "void" or "empty space."
