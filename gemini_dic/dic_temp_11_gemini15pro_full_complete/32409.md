Etymology:
From chill + -ness + -'s (possessive).  "Chill" comes from Old English *ciele (n.), *cielan (v.) "to be cold, make cold," from Proto-Germanic *kaliz, *kaljan "cold" (source also of Old Saxon kali, Old Norse kalr, Dutch koel, German kühl "cool").  "-ness" is a common suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  The final "-'s" is the possessive marker.
