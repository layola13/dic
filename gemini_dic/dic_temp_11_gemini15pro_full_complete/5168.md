PHRASE->
(Not applicable as "allest" is rarely used in set phrases.  It's more of a descriptive word used for emphasis.)


注意事项:
"Allest" is not a standard English word and is considered informal or humorous.  It's often used to emphasize smallness or comprehensiveness in a playful way.  While it might be understood, using "smallest," "tiniest," or "most comprehensive" would be more appropriate in formal writing or speech.  Its etymology is likely a humorous extension of "all" suggesting the superlative degree.
