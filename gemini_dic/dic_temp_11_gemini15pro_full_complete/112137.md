词源:  "Loodi" is likely a slang or informal term, and its exact etymology is uncertain. It may be a regional variation or a newly coined word.  It's not found in standard dictionaries. It might be related to words like "loopy" (meaning crazy or silly) but this is speculative.  If you have more context about where you encountered this word, it might be possible to provide a more accurate origin.
