词源:  "inking" comes from "ink," which has a complex etymology ultimately deriving from the Latin "encaustum" (burnt in), referring to a pigment used in ancient painting. The suffix "-ing" transforms the noun "ink" into a gerund or present participle, indicating the act of applying ink or the result of such action.  Therefore, "inkings" is the plural form, referring to multiple instances of this.
