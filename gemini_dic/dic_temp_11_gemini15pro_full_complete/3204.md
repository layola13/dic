ETYMOLOGY->
From affect + -ed + -ness.  "Affect" ultimately derives from the Latin "afficere" (to do something to, to influence).  The suffix "-ed" creates the past participle (and sometimes adjective form) of verbs. The suffix "-ness" transforms an adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.
