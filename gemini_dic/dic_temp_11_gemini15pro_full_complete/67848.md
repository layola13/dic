注意事项:

该词语属于脏话，不适合在正式场合使用。请谨慎使用。

词源:  "F-ing" is derived from the present participle of the highly vulgar word "fuck." It serves as a euphemism, allowing speakers to express similar intensity without using the offensive word directly. Its origins are likely linked to the general trend of creating euphemisms for taboo words.
