isobar:/ˈaɪsəʊbɑːr/ /ˈaɪsəˌbɑr/
n.
等压线; 同量异位素
A line on a map connecting points having the same atmospheric pressure at a given time or on average over a given period.  A line on a weather map or chart connecting points of equal or constant barometric pressure.  One of two or more atoms or elements having the same atomic weights or mass numbers but different atomic numbers.
Isobars are shown on weather maps to connect points of equal atmospheric pressure. 等压线在地图上用来连接气压相等的点。
Carbon-14 and nitrogen-14 are isobars. 碳-14和氮-14是同量异位素。
近义词: isopleth (for general lines of equal value)
反义词:  (No direct antonym, but areas of significantly different pressure might be described as being separated by a pressure gradient)
词性: noun
