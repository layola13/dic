cyclone-separators:/ˈsaɪkloʊn ˌsɛpəreɪtərz/| n. |旋风分离器|A device that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a gas stream.  The gas stream enters a cylindrical or conical chamber tangentially, causing a swirling motion.  Heavier particles are forced to the outer walls and fall to the bottom, while the cleaner gas exits through a central outlet.|The factory installed new cyclone-separators to reduce air pollution. 工厂安装了新的旋风分离器以减少空气污染。 The cyclone-separators efficiently removed the dust from the airstream. 旋风分离器有效地清除了气流中的灰尘。|近义词：centrifugal separators, vortex separators|反义词:|名词
