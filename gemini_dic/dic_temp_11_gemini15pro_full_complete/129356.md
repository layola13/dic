注意事项:

"Noli" is primarily used in its original Latin context or in phrases derived from Latin.  It is not a common word in modern English.  Its usage is generally limited to formal or literary contexts.  More common ways to express prohibition in English include "don't," "do not," and other similar constructions.  Therefore, providing examples in various tenses and grammatical structures is not applicable as they wouldn't naturally occur in English.
