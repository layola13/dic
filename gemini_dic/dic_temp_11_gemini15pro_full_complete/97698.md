"inide" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism, a technical term specific to a narrow field, or a word from a language other than English.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word), I may be able to offer more assistance.
