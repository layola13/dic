The word "noag" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun, or a technical term specific to a certain field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis for it.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more specific information.  For example, if it's a name, I could help you find its origin.  If it's a technical term, I could direct you to relevant resources.

Since I cannot analyze "noag", I will provide an analysis for the common word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
