词源:  From non- + connivance.  Connivance comes from the Old French *conivance, from coniver "to wink, blink," from Latin connivēre "to shut the eyes, wink," from com- "together" + nivēre "to wink."  Therefore, nonconnivance literally means "not winking," implying not turning a blind eye to wrongdoing.
