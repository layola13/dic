词源：From Old French logier "to provide lodging," from loge "lodging," from Frankish *laubja "shelter," from Proto-Germanic *laubja "covered place, foliage, arbor," from PIE root *leubh- "to peel, strip off bark" (source also of Greek lopos "husk, pod," Latin liber "book," originally "inner bark of a tree"). The sense shifted from "provide lodging" to "dwell, reside" (early 15c.).
