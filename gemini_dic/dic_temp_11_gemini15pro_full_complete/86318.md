注意事项:  It's important to note that "Hebrew's" is not a standard grammatical form. It's more common and natural to use "Hebrew" as an adjective (e.g., "Hebrew scriptures," "Hebrew language") or to use a possessive form like "the Hebrews' scriptures" if referring to something possessed by the Hebrew people.
