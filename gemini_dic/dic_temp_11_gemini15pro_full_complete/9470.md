词源:
"Antiresistantly" is formed by combining the prefix "anti-" (meaning "against" or "opposite of") with the word "resistant" and the adverbial suffix "-ly."  "Resistant" itself comes from the Latin "resistere," meaning "to withstand" or "to oppose." Therefore, "antiresistantly" literally means "in a manner opposing resistance."
