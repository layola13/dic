PHRASE->
(Since "delf" is a noun referring to a specific type of pottery, it doesn't have common phrasal verb combinations like more common words.  Therefore, providing examples with "what" as requested by the prompt instead.)

What's up?  怎么了？/你好吗？
What the hell!  搞什么鬼！
what if = 如果...会怎么样
what for = 为了什么
no matter what = 无论如何


注意事项:
As noted earlier, "delf" is not a common word in modern English. Its usage is primarily confined to discussions about art history, antiques, or specific cultural contexts.  While grammatically correct examples can be constructed for all tenses, they may sound somewhat artificial in everyday conversation.
