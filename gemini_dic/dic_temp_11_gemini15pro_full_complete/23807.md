ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *brasen*, from Old English *bræsen* (“made of brass”), from *bræs* (“brass”).  Ultimately from Proto-Germanic *brasa- (“brass”). Cognate with Dutch *brazen* (“brazen”), German *erzen* (“brazen”).  The figurative sense of “shameless” arose from the association of brass with prostitutes (who wore brass tokens) and other connotations of loudness or harshness.
