ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "blason" meaning "shield, coat of arms," probably from Germanic origin, related to "blaze" in the sense of "to shine, to mark."  The evolution of meaning went from the literal shield to the description of the shield, and then to a more general sense of proclamation or display.
