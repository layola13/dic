词源:
From French *grotesque*, from Italian *grottesco* “of a cave, like a grotto,” from *grotta* “cave, grotto,” from Late Latin *grupta*, variant of Latin *crypta* "vault, crypt." So called from the ancient paintings and decorations found in the caves and grottos of Rome, which were discovered in the late 15th century and were considered bizarre and fantastic.
