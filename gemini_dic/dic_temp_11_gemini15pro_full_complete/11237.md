ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *arch*, meaning "cunning, sly, mischievous," ultimately from Old French *archier*, "to shoot with a bow," from Latin *arcus*, "bow." The meaning shifted from skill with a bow to cunning or slyness. The suffix *-ness* transforms the adjective *arch* into the noun *archness*.
