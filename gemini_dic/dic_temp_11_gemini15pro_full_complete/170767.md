##pseudocoelom: 详细解析ːləm/ | n. | 假体腔 |解析:**true coelom (found in coelomates), which is completely surrounded by mesoderm-derived tissue, a pseudocoelom is only partially lined by mesoderm. The other side of the pseudocoelom is bordered by the endoderm. This means that the pseudocoelom is not a true body cavity within the mesoderm-derived tissues. Organisms possessing a pseudocoelom arecalled pseudocoelomates.  This body cavity is filled with fluid, and it provides some space for internal organs, allowing for greater complexity than acoelomates (organisms lacking a body cavity). However, it offers less structural supportand compartmentalization compared to the true coelomates' coelom.  The pseudocoelom is often important for hydrostatic skeletons, providing a means of support and movement through fluid pressure.  Examples of pseudocoelomates include roundworms and rotifers.s pseudocoelom functions in both support and fluid transport.  线虫的假体腔在支撑和体液运输中发挥作用。体交换。cavity."  This highlights the difference between a true coelom and the incomplete body cavity found in pseudocoelomates.or "internal cavity" might be used in a less precise context.body cavity (acoelomate) fundamentally affects the body plan and physiological capabilities of an organism. This has significant implications in classifying and understanding the evolutionary relationships between different animal phyla.  For example, the pseudocoelom allows for more complex body organization than acoelomate animals, but it limits the extentof organ specialization and compartmentalization compared to animals with a true coelom.  The study of comparative anatomy and embryology is crucial to understanding these differences.
