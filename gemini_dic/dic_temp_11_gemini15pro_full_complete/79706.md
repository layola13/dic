glucinum:/ɡluːˈsaɪnəm/ /ɡluːˈsɪniəm/| n. |铍|A metallic chemical element, atomic number 4, atomic weight 9.0122, symbol Be.  Formerly called glucinum due to the sweet taste of its salts. Now largely replaced by the name beryllium.|Beryllium, formerly known as glucinum, is a strong, lightweight metal used in aerospace alloys.|近义词: beryllium|反义词: None (Elements don't have opposites)|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *glucine* (meaning "sweet"), from Greek *glykys* (meaning "sweet"), because of the sweet taste of some of its compounds, + *-ium* (suffix used to form names of metallic elements).
