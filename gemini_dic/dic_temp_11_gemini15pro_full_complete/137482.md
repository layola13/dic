注意事项:

Since "nontonality" isn't a formally recognized English word, the pronunciation provided is a reasoned guess based on how similar words are pronounced.  The definitions, usage examples, and related terms are based on the understanding of "non-" as a prefix indicating absence and "tonality" referring to the organization of music around a key center.  This analysis assumes the word intends to describe music that lacks a tonal center.
