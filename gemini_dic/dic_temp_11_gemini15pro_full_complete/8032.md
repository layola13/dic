anthropics: /ænˈθrɒpɪks/ | n. | 人择原理 |  The philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it.  It argues that the very fact of our existence imposes constraints on the possible properties of the universe. |  Anthropics suggests that the universe must be capable of supporting life, or we wouldn't be here to observe it.  人择原理表明，宇宙必须能够支持生命，否则我们就不会在这里观察它。|  cosmological principle, observation selection effect | N/A | noun
