anonymousnesses:/ˌænəˈnɪməsnəsəz/ | n. | 匿名性，匿名状态（罕用） |  The state or quality of being anonymous, especially in multiple instances or to a high degree. |  It's rare to encounter the word "anonymousnesses," as "anonymity" usually suffices.  However, one might contrive a sentence like: "The anonymousnesses of the online forum allowed for open debate without fear of reprisal." | 近义词: anonymity, namelessness, obscurity | 反义词: identification, publicity, renown | 词性: noun

Etymology: From "anonymous" + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing state, quality, or condition). "Anonymous" comes from the Greek "anōnymos," meaning "nameless," from "an-" (without) + "onoma" (name).
