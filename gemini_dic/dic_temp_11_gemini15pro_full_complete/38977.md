ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "confinement" (noun), from "confine," from Latin "confīnis" ("bordering," "adjacent") from "con" ("together") + "fīnis" ("boundary," "limit," "end").  The meaning shifted from "bordering territory" to "imprisonment" or "restriction" in movement. The sense of "childbirth" arose later, referring to the period a woman is confined to bed or home.
