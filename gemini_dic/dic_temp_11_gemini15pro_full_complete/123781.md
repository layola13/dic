ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *mōt (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *mōtam (compare Old Frisian mōt "meeting, assembly," Old Saxon mōt "meeting, court," Dutch moet "must," German Mut "courage, mood"), from Proto-Indo-European *mō-t- (compare Latin meō "I go," Gothic ga-mōtjan "to meet"). Originally meaning "a meeting or assembly," the sense evolved to "a discussion or debate," and later to "something debatable or undecided."
