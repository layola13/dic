dodet:/ˈdɔːdet/ (This pronunciation is a guess, as "dodet" is not a standard English word.)| n. (assumed)|十二烷, 十二边形 (Assumed based on potential root "dodec-" meaning twelve)|This word likely refers to a dodecane (a type of hydrocarbon with twelve carbon atoms) or a dodecagon (a twelve-sided polygon).  Since it's not a recognized word, further explanation requires context.|Example:  The chemist synthesized a novel dodet.  化学家合成了一种新的十二烷。(This example is contrived, as the word is not standard.)|近义词: dodecane, dodecagon (depending on intended meaning)|反义词:  None (as it's not a standard word with established opposites)|词性: noun (assumed)


词源:
Likely from the Greek "dodeka-" meaning "twelve."  This root appears in words like "dodecahedron" (twelve-sided solid) and "dodecagon."  The "-et" ending could suggest a diminutive or a specific type, but without more context, its function is unclear.

PHRASE-> (Since "dodet" isn't a real word, these phrases are contrived and for illustrative purposes.)

synthesis of dodet  十二烷的合成
properties of dodet  十二烷的特性
analysis of dodet  十二烷的分析
reaction of dodet  十二烷的反应
structure of dodet  十二烷的结构


注意事项:  Because "dodet" isn't a real word, all examples and explanations are based on conjecture and the likely etymology of the potential root "dodec-."  Using this word in real communication would likely lead to confusion.
