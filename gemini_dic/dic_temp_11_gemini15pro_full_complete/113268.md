词源:
From Middle English *lusti*, from Old English *lustig* (“pleasant, merry, joyful, vigorous, lustful”), from Proto-Germanic *lustagaz* (“desirable, pleasant”), from Proto-Indo-European *lewk- (“to shine, see”). Cognate with West Frisian *lustich* (“cheerful, jolly”), Dutch *lustig* (“cheerful, jolly, funny”), German *lustig* (“cheerful, jolly, funny”), Swedish *lustig* (“jolly, merry, funny”), Icelandic *lystugur* (“cheerful, jolly, merry”). More at light. The meaning shifted from “merry, cheerful” to “healthy, vigorous,” and then in Middle English acquired connotations of “lustful.”
