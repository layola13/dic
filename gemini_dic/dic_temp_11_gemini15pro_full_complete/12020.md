arthrostraca:/ˌɑːrθrɒˈstreɪkə/ | n. |节肢动物门甲壳纲的一亚纲（旧称）|A former subclass of crustaceans, now generally considered to comprise the classes Malacostraca (e.g., crabs, shrimps, woodlice) and Maxillopoda (e.g., barnacles, copepods).  It is no longer scientifically valid.|Arthrostraca, which included crabs and shrimps, were once thought to be a single group. 节肢动物（包含螃蟹和虾）曾被认为是一个单一类别。|Synonym: Crustacea (in older classifications)|Antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a taxonomic group. Could contrast with other invertebrate groups like Insecta or Mollusca)|Noun

Biologists no longer recognize Arthrostraca as a valid group. 生物学家不再承认节肢动物是一个有效的类别。
Some older textbooks still refer to Arthrostraca. 一些旧教科书仍然提到节肢动物。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Scientists are constantly refining the classification of crustaceans. 科学家们正在不断完善甲壳类动物的分类。
Researchers are discovering new species that challenge old taxonomic groups like Arthrostraca. 研究人员正在发现新的物种，这些物种对像节肢动物这样的旧分类群提出了挑战。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Taxonomists have abandoned the term Arthrostraca. 分类学家已经放弃了节肢动物这个术语。
Genetic analysis has shown that Arthrostraca is not a natural group. 基因分析表明，节肢动物不是一个自然群体。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Biologists have been studying crustacean evolution for many years. 生物学家多年来一直在研究甲壳类动物的进化。
They have been refining the classification of these animals based on new evidence.  他们一直在根据新的证据改进这些动物的分类。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Scientists once classified crabs and shrimps within Arthrostraca. 科学家曾经将螃蟹和虾归类为节肢动物。
The term Arthrostraca fell out of favor in the 20th century. 节肢动物这个词在20世纪不再受青睐。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Researchers were investigating the relationships between different crustacean groups. 研究人员正在调查不同甲壳类动物群体之间的关系。
They were discovering evidence that challenged the validity of Arthrostraca.  他们正在发现挑战节肢动物有效性的证据。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before modern genetic techniques, scientists had classified crustaceans based on morphology. 在现代遗传技术出现之前，科学家根据形态对甲壳类动物进行分类。
They had considered Arthrostraca to be a valid subclass. 他们曾认为节肢动物是一个有效的亚纲。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Biologists had been studying Arthrostraca for decades before its reclassification. 在重新分类之前，生物学家已经研究了节肢动物几十年。
They had been gathering data that eventually led to its abandonment. 他们一直在收集最终导致其被放弃的数据。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Future research will further clarify the relationships between crustacean groups. 未来的研究将进一步阐明甲壳类动物群体之间的关系。
New discoveries will likely lead to further revisions of crustacean taxonomy. 新的发现可能会导致对甲壳类动物分类法的进一步修订。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Scientists will be using genetic data to refine crustacean classification. 科学家将利用基因数据来完善甲壳类动物的分类。
They will be investigating the evolutionary history of these fascinating animals. 他们将研究这些迷人动物的进化史。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of this century, biologists will have gained a much deeper understanding of crustacean evolution. 到本世纪末，生物学家将对甲壳类动物的进化有更深入的了解。
They will have developed a more accurate and comprehensive classification system. 他们将开发出一个更准确、更全面的分类系统。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
Scientists will have been studying crustacean evolution for centuries. 科学家们将已经研究甲壳类动物的进化几个世纪了。
By that time, they will have been accumulating vast amounts of data on these organisms. 到那时，他们将积累了关于这些生物的大量数据。
