gravitons: /ˈɡrævɪtɒnz/ (UK) /ˈɡrævɪtɑːnz/ (US)| n. |引力子|A hypothetical elementary particle that mediates the force of gravity in quantum gravity theories.  It is analogous to the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic force.  Gravitons are not yet proven to exist.|Scientists are searching for evidence of gravitons.|Near synonyms:  (None - as a hypothetical particle, it doesn't have direct synonyms.  One could refer to "force carriers" or "mediating particles" in a broader sense.)|Antonyms:  (None - the concept doesn't lend itself to antonyms.)|Noun
