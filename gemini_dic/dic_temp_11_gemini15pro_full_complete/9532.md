ETYMOLOGY->

From French *antisémitisme*, from *anti-* (against) + *sémitique* (Semitic) + *-isme* (-ism).  The term "Semitic" refers to a group of languages including Hebrew and Arabic.  However, "antisemitism" specifically targets Jewish people, not all speakers of Semitic languages.  The term was coined in the late 19th century to give a pseudoscientific veneer to prejudice against Jews.
