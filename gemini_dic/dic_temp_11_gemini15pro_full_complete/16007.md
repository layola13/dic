ETYMOLOGY->
From French *banal*, "belonging to the ban" (a feudal lord's jurisdiction), hence "common, commonplace," from Old French *ban* "proclamation, jurisdiction," from Frankish *ban* "command, order," from Proto-Germanic *bannan* "to proclaim." The semantic shift occurred because things available to all within a lord's ban became ordinary and commonplace.
