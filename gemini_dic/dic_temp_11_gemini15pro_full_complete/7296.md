angstrom:/ˈæŋstrəm/ |n.|埃（长度单位）|A unit of length equal to one ten-billionth of a meter (10⁻¹⁰ meter), used chiefly in expressing wavelengths and interatomic distances.|The wavelength of visible light is in the range of hundreds of angstroms.|Synonym: Ångström unit|Antonym:  (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement, but larger units like nanometer, micrometer, millimeter, etc., could be considered contrasting units)|noun
