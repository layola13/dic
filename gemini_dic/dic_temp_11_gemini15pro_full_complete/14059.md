注意事项:

"Austral's" is not a common word. "Austral" is more frequently used as an adjective itself, or in the form "austral regions/lands/seas" etc. While grammatically correct, using "austral's" possessively can sound a bit awkward.  Consider rephrasing using "of the austral regions" or similar constructions for clearer and more natural-sounding English.
