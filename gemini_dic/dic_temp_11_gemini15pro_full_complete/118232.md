mercator's projection: /mərˈkeɪtərz prəˈdʒɛkʃən/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | A cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.  | Example: Navigators relied heavily on Mercator's projection for charting courses across the oceans. 航海家非常依赖墨卡托投影来绘制穿越海洋的航线。

Example: Although useful for navigation, Mercator's projection distorts the size of landmasses, especially near the poles. 虽然对航海有用，但墨卡托投影会扭曲陆地的尺寸，尤其是在两极附近。 | 近义词: cylindrical projection 圆柱投影 | 反义词: (No direct antonym, but other map projections like the Gall-Peters projection offer different perspectives and minimize different distortions)  | 词性: noun

mercators projections: /mərˈkeɪtərz prəˈdʒɛkʃənz/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | Plural form of "Mercator's projection." Refers to multiple instances or uses of this map projection. | Example:  Many classrooms display mercators projections to teach geography. 许多教室展示墨卡托投影来教授地理。

Example:  Understanding the limitations of mercators projections is crucial for interpreting map data accurately. 理解墨卡托投影的局限性对于准确解释地图数据至关重要。 | 近义词: cylindrical projections 圆柱投影 | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, see above) | 词性: noun
