词源: From Middle English *chapellen, from Old French chapeler, from chapele (“chapel”), from Late Latin cappella (“chapel”), diminutive of Latin cappa (“cape, hood, cloak”). The word originally referred to the short cloak or cope of St. Martin of Tours, a relic of which was preserved in a sanctuary that became known as a chapel. The verb sense developed from the association of chapels with religious services.
