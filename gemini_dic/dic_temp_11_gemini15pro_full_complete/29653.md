Etymology: Compound of "cat" (referring to a feline) + "fight."  The term likely arose from the observation that female cats often engage in hissing, scratching, and yowling fights.  The application to human fights, particularly between women, likely carries connotations of a similar kind of undignified, clawing, and vocal altercation.
