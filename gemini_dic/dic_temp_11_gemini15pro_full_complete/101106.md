invertebracy:/ɪnˈvɜːrtɪbrəsi/ |n.|无脊椎动物的特性；无脊椎动物的状态|The invertebracy of the creature was evident in its lack of a backbone.|该生物的无脊椎性在其缺乏脊椎骨中显而易见。|近义词: spinelessness |反义词: vertebratecy| 词性: noun

Etymology:
From in- + vertebrate + -acy.  "In-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "without." "Vertebrate" refers to animals with a backbone. "-acy" is a suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
