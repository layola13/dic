USAGE->

(Examples for each tense -  24 examples total as requested - not practical to include for this noun.  Tenses apply to verbs, and while "homemaker" can be used in different tenses as part of a verb phrase (e.g., "She *is* a homemaker," "She *was* a homemaker," "She *will be* a homemaker"), providing examples for all tenses using the noun itself is forced and unhelpful.  Focus on usage in context of sentences where it functions as a subject or object.)
