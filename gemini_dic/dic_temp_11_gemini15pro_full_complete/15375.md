backtracking:/ˈbækˌtrækɪŋ/ | n. | 回溯法；回溯；倒退 |  A problem-solving technique that involves exploring potential solutions and abandoning a path when it leads to a dead end, then returning to the previous choice point and trying another path.  | The algorithm uses backtracking to find all possible solutions.  这个算法使用回溯法来找到所有可能的解决方案。 |  regression, recursion | progression | noun
