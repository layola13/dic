ETYMOLOGY->
From conceited + -ness.  Conceited comes from Middle French conceipt "thought, opinion," from Old French conceit "conception," past participle of concevoir "to conceive," from Latin concipere "to take in, conceive, become pregnant," from com- "together" + capere "to take."  The meaning shifted to "fanciful notion" and later to "vanity."
