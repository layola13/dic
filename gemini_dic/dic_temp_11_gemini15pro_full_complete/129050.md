nitrification:/ˌnaɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. |硝化作用| The process by which ammonia is converted to nitrites and then to nitrates, primarily by soil-dwelling bacteria, making nitrogen available to plants in a usable form. |例句：Nitrification plays a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle. 硝化作用在氮循环中起着至关重要的作用。

例句：The nitrification process is essential for plant growth. 硝化过程对植物生长至关重要。|近义词：nitrogen fixation (somewhat), mineralization|反义词：denitrification|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From  nitrify + -ation.  nitrify from nitr(o-)  + -ify.  nitr(o-) from  French nitre "niter, saltpeter" (see niter).  -ify from -fier, from French -fier, from Latin -ficāre, combining form of facere "to make, do." -ation from French -ation, from Latin -ātiō, suffix forming nouns of action.
