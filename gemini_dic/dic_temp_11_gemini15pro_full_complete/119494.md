micropegmatite:/ˈmaɪkroʊˈpɛɡməˌtaɪt/
n.
微伟晶岩
A very fine-grained igneous rock having the composition of pegmatite.  A rock composed of microscopic crystals of quartz and feldspar, typically occurring as a groundmass in graphic granite.
Micropegmatite is often found in graphic granite. 微伟晶岩经常在文象花岗岩中发现。
Micropegmatite textures can be observed under a microscope. 在显微镜下可以观察到微伟晶岩的结构。
近义词:granophyre, graphic granite
反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps coarse-grained igneous rock)


ETYMOLOGY->
micro- (small) + pegmatite (a coarsely crystalline igneous rock)
"micro-" comes from Greek "mikros" meaning "small."
"pegmatite" comes from Greek "pēgma," meaning "something fastened together," referring to the interlocking crystals.
