注意事项:
"Garbages" is not standard English. The word "garbage" is an uncountable noun and does not typically take a plural form.  The correct way to refer to multiple instances or types of garbage is simply "garbage."  While some dialects might use "garbages," it's best avoided in formal writing and speech.  Using "trash," "rubbish," or "waste" in the plural form is acceptable (trashes, rubbishes, wastes) when referring to different types of refuse.
