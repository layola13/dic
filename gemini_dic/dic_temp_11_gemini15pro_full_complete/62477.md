endosmosis:/ˌɛndɒzˈməʊsɪs/ /ˌɛndoʊzˈmoʊsɪs/
noun|内渗；内渗透|The inward passage of a fluid through a semipermeable membrane toward a fluid of higher concentration, especially when the fluids are separated by a cell membrane.|Water enters the roots of plants by endosmosis. 水通过内渗作用进入植物的根部。|近义词：inward osmosis|反义词: exosmosis|词性:n.

Etymology:
From endo- (within) + osmosis (pushing).  The term "osmosis" itself comes from the Greek ὠσμός (ōsmós), meaning "push" or "impulse."
