词性: adjective

词源:  From Latin *exstructus, past participle of *exstruere "to pile up, build up, erect," from ex- "out" + struere "to pile, build."  While the prefix *ex- often indicates removal or destruction, in this case, its original meaning might have been closer to "fully built up" or "elaborately constructed." Over time, likely due to confusion with other prefixes like *de- or *dis-, the meaning shifted to its current destructive sense.  However, this shift wasn't complete, resulting in a word that is now rarely used and often misunderstood.
