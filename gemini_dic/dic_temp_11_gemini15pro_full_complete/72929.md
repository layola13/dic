词源：From the verb "fondle," which comes from the Middle English "fondlen," meaning "to caress, treat tenderly."  Ultimately from the Old French "folaillier," related to "fol," meaning "foolish." The original meaning was likely related to playful or foolish handling, but the word has since taken on a more sexual connotation.
