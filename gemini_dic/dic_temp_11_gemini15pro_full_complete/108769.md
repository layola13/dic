Etymology: From Middle English *lesen*, from Anglo-Norman *lessier*, from Old French *laissier*, from Latin *laxāre* (“to loosen, slacken, relax”), from *laxus* (“loose, slack”).  The sense of "to grant the temporary possession or use of lands or tenements to another for rent" arose from the notion of "releasing" one's hold on property.
