adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From chintz (a brightly printed and glazed cotton fabric, typically from India) + -y (adjective suffix). The association with cheapness likely arose from the mass production and widespread availability of chintz, leading to its perception as less valuable than other fabrics.  The meaning of "stingy" is a figurative extension of this sense of cheapness.
