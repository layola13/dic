Etymology:  From Late Latin *exhibitant- (stem of exhibitans), present participle of exhibere "to show, display, produce," from ex- "out" + habere "to hold."  The original sense was "protruding, prominent." The modern sense of "excessive" likely developed from the idea of prices being "displayed" prominently or excessively high.
