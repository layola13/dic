The word "basee" is not a standard English word. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (like where you encountered this word), I can try to offer a more helpful response.

However, assuming you meant "base," here's a breakdown:

base:/beɪs/| n. adj.|基础，底部；卑鄙的|The base of the statue is made of marble. 雕像的底座是大理石做的。|近义词：foundation, bottom, basis, mean, low|反义词:top, peak, noble, virtuous|词性: noun, adjective

base:/beɪs/| vt.|以...为基础|Our research is based on scientific evidence. 我们的研究基于科学证据。|近义词：ground, establish|反义词: |词性: verb
