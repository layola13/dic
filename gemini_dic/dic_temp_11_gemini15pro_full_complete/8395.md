Etymology->
From anti- + Semitism.  "Anti-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposed to". "Semitism" refers to Semitic languages or peoples, but in this context, it specifically refers to Jewish people. The term gained prominence in the late 19th century as a seemingly more scientific or justified term for Jew-hatred.
