词源:  "nonextrications" is derived from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "extrication" (meaning "the act of freeing or releasing something from a difficult situation").  Therefore, it literally means "not being able to be freed or released."  "Extrication" itself comes from the Latin word "extricare," meaning "to disentangle."
