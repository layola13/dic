词源：
"line-caught" is a compound adjective formed from the noun "line" (referring to a fishing line) and the past participle of the verb "catch."  The word "line" ultimately comes from the Old English "līne," meaning "rope" or "cord," while "catch" comes from the Old North French "cachier," meaning "to chase" or "to hunt."  The combination "line-caught" specifically describes fish or other aquatic animals caught using a fishing line and hook, as opposed to nets or other methods.
