anorn:/ˈeɪnɔːrn/ | adj. | 无角的，没有装饰的 | Lacking horns or ornamentation. |  The anorn cattle grazed peacefully in the field. 无角的牛群在田野里平静地吃草。| Synonym: hornless, unadorned, plain | Antonym: horned, ornamented, decorated | adjective

Etymology:  "an-" (without) + "orn" (from Latin "ornatus," meaning "adorned" or "decorated").  The prefix "an-" signifies absence or negation, while the root "orn" relates to decoration or embellishment. Therefore, "anorn" literally means "without decoration" or "unadorned."
