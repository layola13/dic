irrotational:/ˌɪrəʊˈteɪʃənəl/| adj.|无旋的，非旋转的|Not rotating; having a curl of zero.  Used especially of a vector field.|The irrotational flow of the fluid was crucial to the experiment.  流体的无旋流动对实验至关重要。|近义词:curl-free, non-rotational, lamellar|反义词:rotational, vortical|词性:形容词
词源:  From ir- 'not' + rotational.  The prefix "ir-" is a variant of "in-" meaning "not," and "rotational" relates to rotation.
