From Ancient Greek ἀποδεικτικός (apodeiktikós, “demonstrative”), from ἀποδείκνυμι (apodeíknymi, “I demonstrate”).


PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Apodictically" is an adverb and doesn't typically form set phrases.  It modifies verbs and adjectives, describing *how* something is said or done, rather than forming a distinct unit of meaning with other words.
