| adj.|毫不含糊的，明确的|Expressing oneself clearly and unambiguously, without resorting to equivocation or ambiguity.|His outequivocating statement left no room for misinterpretation. 他毫不含糊的声明没有留下任何误解的余地。|Synonym: unequivocal, unambiguous, forthright, direct, plain-spoken|Antonym: equivocal, ambiguous, evasive, vague, obscure|adjective


Etymology:
"Out-" (prefix meaning "exceeding," "surpassing," or "thoroughly") + "equivocate" (from Latin "aequi-" meaning "equal" and "vocare" meaning "to call," hence "to call by the same name," or "to use ambiguous language").  The prefix "out-" intensifies the meaning of "equivocate" to suggest a complete absence of ambiguity.
