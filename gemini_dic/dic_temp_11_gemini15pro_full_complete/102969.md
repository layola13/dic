词源:
Jeames is a humorous, often derogatory, term for a liveried footman or other male servant. It originated as a misspelling of the name "James," which was a common name for servants in Victorian England.  Thackeray popularized the term in his "Jeames's Diary" in *Punch* magazine, satirizing the social pretensions of newly rich servants.
