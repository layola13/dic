The word "newan" isn't a recognized English word. It's possible there's a typo or it's a slang term, dialectal word, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, its intended meaning, etc.), I can try to offer a more accurate analysis.

Since I cannot analyze "newan," I'll use the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
