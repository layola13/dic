PHRASE-> (Not applicable as 'actinophonic' is a technical adjective and doesn't form common phrases.)


词源:  From actino- + -phonic.  "Actino-" refers to actinomycetes, and "-phonic" relates to sound or production. However, in this context, "-phonic" refers more broadly to "produced by" or "caused by".
