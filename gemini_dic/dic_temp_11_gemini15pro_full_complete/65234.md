The word "etration" itself isn't a valid English word.  It seems like a fragment, possibly of "penetration." If that's the intended word, here's the breakdown:

penetration: /ˌpɛnɪˈtreɪʃən/ | n. | 渗透，穿透，洞察力 | The penetration of the market by the new product was remarkably swift.  新产品迅速渗透市场。|例句：The bullet's penetration was deep. 子弹的穿透力很强。 |例句：His penetration into the complex issue was impressive. 他对这个复杂问题的洞察力令人印象深刻。 | 近义词：infiltration, permeation, insight, understanding | 反义词: superficiality, shallowness | 词性: 名词
