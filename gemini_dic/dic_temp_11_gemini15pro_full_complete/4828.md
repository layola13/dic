aliasing:/ˈeɪliəsɪŋ/ | n. | 混叠，别名 |  The distortion of a signal caused by a sampling rate that is too low, resulting in different signals becoming indistinguishable.  It is a phenomenon where two different signals become indistinguishable when sampled. | The jagged edges on the diagonal lines in the image are a result of aliasing. 图像中对角线上的锯齿状边缘是混叠的结果。|  Anti-aliasing techniques can mitigate these effects. 抗锯齿技术可以减轻这些影响。 | synonyms: distortion, artifact | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but consider terms like "accurate representation", "faithful reproduction") | noun
