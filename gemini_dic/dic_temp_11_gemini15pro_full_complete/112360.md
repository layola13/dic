ETYMOLOGY->
From the late 19th century, a shortened form of the earlier British word "lurry," meaning a long, flat wagon or handcart. The origin of "lurry" is uncertain, possibly related to the verb "lurry" meaning "to pull or drag," or perhaps from the dialectal word "lurry" meaning "a disturbance or commotion." The shift in meaning from "lurry" (wagon) to "lorry" (motor vehicle) occurred as motor vehicles began to replace horse-drawn wagons.
