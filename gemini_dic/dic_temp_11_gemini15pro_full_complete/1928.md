actinomere:/ˈæktɪnəmɪər/| n. |肌节|A contractile unit of striated muscle tissue, composed of overlapping thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments between two adjacent Z lines. |The arrangement of actin and myosin filaments within the actinomere gives skeletal muscle its striated appearance. 肌节内肌动蛋白和肌球蛋白丝的排列赋予骨骼肌横纹外观。| The contraction of a muscle fiber is caused by the shortening of its component actinomeres.  肌肉纤维的收缩是由其组成部分肌节的缩短引起的。|sarcomere| |noun
