词源:
From Middle English engin, from Old French engin, from Latin ingenium (“natural capacity, talent, intelligence, clever invention”), from in- (“in, within”) + gignere, genui (“to beget, produce”).  The original meaning was "inherent quality, especially mental power, hence a product of ingenuity, a contrivance." The sense narrowed to “mechanical contrivance” by the 14th century.  The possessive form simply adds -'s.
