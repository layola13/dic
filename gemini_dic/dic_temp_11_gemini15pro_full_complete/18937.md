ETYMOLOGY->
From the past participle of the verb *bespeak*, meaning "to speak for, to order."  The word *bespeak* itself comes from Old English *besprecan*, from *be-* (prefix meaning "thoroughly") + *sprecan* (to speak).  The past participle form *bespoken* gradually evolved into an adjective, *bespoke*, meaning "ordered in advance."
