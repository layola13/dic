##plasticities /plæˈstɪsətiz/ | n. |可塑性；可塑性复数 |  塑性；可塑能力；柔韧性；延展性 |  The plasticities of clay allow for intricate sculpting.  黏土的可塑性使其能够进行复杂的雕刻。  The different plasticities of the metals required varied techniques. 不同金属的可塑性需要不同的技术。 | 近义词：malleability, flexibility, ductility | 反义词：rigidity, inflexibilityword *plasticitas*, which itself derives from the Greek word *plastikos* (πλαστικός).  *Plastikos* means "fit for molding," "capable of being molded," or "skilled in molding." This in turnstems from the verb *plassein* (πλάσσειν), meaning "to mold," "to shape," or "to form."  Therefore, the root of the word reflects the inherent ability of a material to be shaped or molded.multiple instances or types of plasticity exhibited by different materials or in different contexts.  It highlights the variability or range of a material's ability to be deformed permanently without fracturing.fracturing.  Different materials, such as metals, polymers, and ceramics, exhibit varying degrees of plasticity, depending on their microstructure and composition.  A material's plasticity is often tested using tensile testing to determine its yield strength and elongation.to the brain's ability to adapt and change throughout life.  This neural plasticity allows for learning, memory formation, and recovery from brain injury. In this context, "plasticities" might represent the diverse ways in which different brain systems exhibit adapting or changing.can describe the malleable qualities of materials such as clay, wax, or even certain types of paint, enabling artists to create sculptures or paintings with a high degree of detail and texture.this attribute. For example, one might talk of the "plasticities of various polymers" to emphasize how different synthetic materials have different behaviors under stress.研究揭示了两种合金在高温条件下的可塑性存在显著差异。，重点关注与年龄相关的变化和个体差异。explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of the word "plasticities," including its etymology, usage across various fields, and illustrative examples.
