The word "lambale" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a slang term, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

However, if you meant **"lambda" (λ)**, here's the analysis:


lambda: /ˈlæmdə/ | n. | lambda; 拉姆达 | The Greek letter λ or Λ.  It is used in physics, mathematics, and computer science to represent various concepts. | Example:  The decay constant is represented by lambda. 衰变常数用拉姆达表示。| Example: Lambda expressions are used in functional programming. Lambda表达式用于函数式编程。 | Synonym: (depending on context) constant, variable, parameter | Antonym: (none generally applicable) | noun
