microperthite:/ˌmaɪkrəˈpɜːrθaɪt/
n.
微斜长石
A feldspar mineral consisting of two intergrown components, albite (sodium aluminum silicate) and orthoclase (potassium aluminum silicate), that are visible under a microscope.
Microperthite is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks. 微斜长石是许多火成岩和变质岩的常见成分。
Microperthite can be distinguished from perthite by the smaller size of the intergrowths.  微斜长石可以通过其更小的共生体尺寸与斜长石区分开来。
