ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *kene, from Old English cēne (“bold, brave, sharp, keen”), from Proto-Germanic *kōniz (“wise, clever, able”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵneh₁- (“to know”). Cognate with Dutch keen (“sharp”), German kühn (“bold, daring”).  The sense of "eager" developed in the 16th century.  The verb "to keen" (wail) is from Irish caoinim (“I weep, wail”).
