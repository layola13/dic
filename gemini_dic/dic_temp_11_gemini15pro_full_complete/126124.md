mutex:/ˈmjuːteks/| n.|互斥锁，互斥体|A programming construct that allows only one thread or process to access a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.  It's short for "mutual exclusion".|The program uses a mutex to protect the shared data from concurrent access.|Synonyms: lock, semaphore|Antonyms: N/A|noun


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The mutex prevents data corruption. = 这个互斥锁防止数据损坏。
The system uses mutexes to manage shared resources. = 系统使用互斥锁来管理共享资源。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is acquiring the mutex. = 程序正在获取互斥锁。
The thread is waiting for the mutex to be released. = 线程正在等待互斥锁被释放。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The thread has acquired the mutex. = 线程已经获取了互斥锁。
The program has released the mutex. = 程序已经释放了互斥锁。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The thread has been waiting for the mutex for a long time. = 线程一直在等待互斥锁很长时间了。
The program has been using the mutex to protect the data. = 程序一直在使用互斥锁来保护数据。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program acquired the mutex before accessing the data. = 程序在访问数据之前获取了互斥锁。
The thread released the mutex after finishing its work. = 线程完成工作后释放了互斥锁。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The thread was waiting for the mutex when the error occurred. = 错误发生时，线程正在等待互斥锁。
The program was using the mutex to protect the data during the operation. = 操作期间，程序正在使用互斥锁来保护数据。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The thread had acquired the mutex before the other thread requested it. = 在另一个线程请求互斥锁之前，该线程已经获取了它。
The program had released the mutex before the error occurred. = 错误发生之前，程序已经释放了互斥锁。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The thread had been waiting for the mutex for several seconds before it was released. = 在互斥锁被释放之前，线程已经等待了几秒钟。
The program had been using the mutex to synchronize access to the shared resource. = 程序一直在使用互斥锁来同步对共享资源的访问。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will acquire the mutex before accessing the shared data. = 程序将在访问共享数据之前获取互斥锁。
The thread will release the mutex after completing its task. = 线程将在完成其任务后释放互斥锁。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be using the mutex to protect the data during the critical section. = 在关键部分期间，程序将使用互斥锁来保护数据。
The thread will be waiting for the mutex until it becomes available. = 线程将一直等待互斥锁，直到它可用为止。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the time the other thread requests the mutex, this thread will have released it. = 当其他线程请求互斥锁时，此线程将已经释放了它。
The program will have acquired the mutex before accessing the critical section. = 程序将在访问关键部分之前获取互斥锁。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The thread will have been waiting for the mutex for a long time if it doesn't become available soon. = 如果互斥锁很快不可用，线程将已经等待了很长时间。
The program will have been using the mutex to protect the data throughout the operation. = 在整个操作过程中，程序将一直在使用互斥锁来保护数据。



PHRASE->
acquire a mutex = 获取互斥锁
release a mutex = 释放互斥锁
mutex lock = 互斥锁
mutex object = 互斥锁对象
shared mutex = 共享互斥锁
