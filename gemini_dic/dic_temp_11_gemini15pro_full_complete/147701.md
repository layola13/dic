overprecision:/ˌoʊvərprɪˈsɪʒən/ | n. | 过度精确，过度精准 | The state of being excessively precise, often to the point of being impractical or misleading.  |  His overprecision in the measurements led to delays in the project. 他在测量上的过度精确导致了项目延误。 |  precision, meticulousness | imprecision, inaccuracy | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
"over-" (Old English "ofer", meaning "above, beyond") + "precision" (from Late Latin "praecisio", meaning "a cutting off", from Latin "praecidere", "to cut off before").  The prefix "over-" indicates an excess or surpassing of normal precision.
