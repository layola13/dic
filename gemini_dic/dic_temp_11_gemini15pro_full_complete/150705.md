##parabolas:/pəˈræbələz/ | n. |抛物线 |-shaped curve.  It's a conic section—a curve formed by the intersection of a cone with a plane parallel to a side of the cone.In mathematics, parabolas are defined by quadratic equations, typically expressed as $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants. The parabola's shape is determined by the value of 'a':  a positive 'a' results in a U-shaped curve that opens upwards, while a negative 'a' yields a U-shaped curve opening downwards. The vertex is the lowest or highest point of the parabola. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, dividing the parabola into two mirror-image halves. Parabolas have many applications inphysics and engineering, describing the trajectory of projectiles under gravity and the shape of satellite dishes, among other things.建筑师设计这座桥时使用了抛物线拱形结构以增强其强度。"application" or "comparison." This is because the ancient Greek mathematicians, particularly Apollonius of Perga, studied parabolas as a comparison in terms of the geometric figures formed by intersecting cones and planes.  The connection to the U-shaped curve arises from the geometrical way parabolas were initially defined and understood.**用法说明:**," and "latus rectum," which all refer to specific points and lines related to the defining properties of the curve.  Understanding the properties of parabolas is crucial in various applications, from designing antennas to understanding the motion of objects under gravity.  The equation defining a parabola is a fundamental concept in algebra and calculus.
