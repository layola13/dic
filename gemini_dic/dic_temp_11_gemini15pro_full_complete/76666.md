ETYMOLOGY->
From Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), Italian physician and physicist, who discovered “animal electricity”. The term "galvanism" originally referred to the electricity produced by chemical action, especially in a battery, and was later broadened to encompass the effects of electricity on living tissue.
