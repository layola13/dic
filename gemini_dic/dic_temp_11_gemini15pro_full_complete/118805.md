metamict:/ˌmɛtəˈmɪkt/ | adj. |  变晶质的，非晶质的 |  Having lost crystalline structure due to radiation damage, typically from alpha particles emitted by constituent radioactive elements. This results in a partially or completely amorphous state, while retaining the original chemical composition. | The zircon crystal was metamict due to prolonged exposure to uranium and thorium. 这颗锆石晶体由于长期暴露于铀和钍而变成了变晶质。| Synonym: amorphous, disordered | Antonym: crystalline, ordered | adjective

metamict:/ˌmɛtəˈmɪkt/ | n. | 变晶质矿物 | A mineral that has become metamict. | The study focused on the properties of metamicts found in the area. 这项研究的重点是该地区发现的变晶质矿物的特性。| Synonym: amorphous mineral | Antonym: crystalline mineral | noun
