PHRASE->
N/A (Encircle is less commonly used in set phrases.  It's more often used in descriptive contexts.)


Etymology:
From en- + circle.  "En-" is a prefix meaning "to put into or onto," "to cause to be," or "to make."  "Circle" comes from the Old French "cercle" and ultimately from the Latin "circulus," meaning "small ring."
