Etymology:
From humor + -some + -ly.  "Humor" comes from Middle English, from Old French "humour," from Latin "humor" meaning "moisture, fluid."  The sense of "temperament" arose from the ancient belief that the body's fluids influenced personality.  "-some" is an Old English suffix meaning "characterized by" or "tending to."  "-ly" is a suffix forming adverbs from adjectives.
