Etymology:
From Old French *emprester*, from Vulgar Latin *imprestare* "to lend," from Latin *in praestare* "to stand before, provide, furnish," from *in* "in" + *praestare* "to stand before, excel, furnish, exhibit."  The noun meaning "loan" is now obsolete, but the sense of "money advanced as a loan" has survived.
