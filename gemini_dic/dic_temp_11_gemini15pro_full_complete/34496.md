词源: From Old English *clæne (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *klainą (“clean, pure, clear”), from Proto-Indo-European *kloy- (“to hear, listen; to be called, be famed”). Cognate with Middle Low German klēn (“clean, fine”), Dutch klein (“small, little”), German klein (“small”). The semantic development from “pure” to “small” is unique to West Germanic.  The sense of “clear” is retained in the expression “a clean bill of health.”
