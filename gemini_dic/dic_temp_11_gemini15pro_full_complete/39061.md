conformations:/ˌkɒnfɔːˈmeɪʃənz/ (US) /ˌkɑːnfɔːrˈmeɪʃənz/| n. |构象，构型|The three-dimensional shape of a molecule, especially a large molecule such as a protein, that can change by rotations about single bonds.  A molecule can adopt many conformations, but typically only one or a few are biologically active.|The protein can exist in several different conformations.|Synonyms: shapes, structures, forms, arrangements|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym for a physical arrangement, possibly 'disorder' in a general sense)|Noun
