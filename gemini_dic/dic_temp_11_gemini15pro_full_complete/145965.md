词源:
From over- + distraught.  "Distraught" itself comes from the Old English *distract, past participle of distrahere "to pull apart, distract," from Latin distractus, past participle of distrahere "draw in different directions," from dis- "apart" + trahere "to draw."  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning, indicating an excessive degree of distraughtness.
