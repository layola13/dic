词源:

The origin of "humbug" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it comes from the Irish phrase "uim bog," meaning "soft copper" or counterfeit money. Another connects it to "Hamburg," suggesting a connection with spurious goods from that city.  "Humbugger" is a derivative of "humbug," referring to a person who perpetrates a humbug.
