ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *μόνος (mónos, “single, alone”) + *γράφειν (gráphein, “to write”) + *-ous (adjective-forming suffix).  Originally referring to a scholarly work on a single subject (monograph). The biological meaning developed later by analogy, referring to a parasite restricted to a single host or an animal with a single food source.

(Monographous doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases.  It's a specialized term used mainly in scientific contexts.  Therefore, providing general phrases with "what" is more relevant given the original prompt's inclusion of such examples.)

What's up? = 怎么了？/ 你好吗？
What if it rains? = 如果下雨怎么办？
What for? = 为了什么？
What about going to the cinema? = 去看电影怎么样？
