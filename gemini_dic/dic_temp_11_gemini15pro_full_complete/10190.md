词源：From French à port "to the port," from port "port, harbor" (from Latin portus). The nautical sense "left side of a ship" arose because ships were originally steered with a steering oar mounted on the right side (starboard).  When docking, the steering oar would be on the side away from the dock, hence the left side became known as the "port" side.
