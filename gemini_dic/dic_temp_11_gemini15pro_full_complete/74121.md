ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *fole, foule "crowd, throng," from Vulgar Latin *fŏlia, plural of *fŏlium "leaf," used figuratively for a mass of people, like leaves on a tree. Ultimately from Latin folium "leaf."  The semantic shift from "leaf" to "crowd" likely occurred through the intermediate sense of a "full quantity, abundance."
