注意事项:

While "defedation" technically exists and can refer to both desecration and defecation, it's incredibly archaic and rarely used.  "Defecation" is the common and preferred term for excreting waste, while "desecration" or "pollution" are used for the act of defiling.  Using "defedation" in modern English might cause confusion or be perceived as a misspelling.  It's strongly recommended to use the more common and clearer synonyms provided.
