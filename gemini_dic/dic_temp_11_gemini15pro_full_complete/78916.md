Etymology:
From "gypsydom" + "'s" (possessive). "Gypsydom" is formed from "gypsy" (now often considered offensive and replaced by "Roma" or "Romany") + "-dom," a suffix denoting a state or condition, realm, or domain.  The word "gypsy" itself originates from a misnomer, as the Roma people were mistakenly believed to have come from Egypt.
