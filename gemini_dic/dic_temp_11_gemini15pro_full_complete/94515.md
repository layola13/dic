ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *importunen*, from Old French *importuner*, from Late Latin *importunare* "to make oneself troublesome," from Latin *importunus* "unfit, troublesome, inconvenient," from *in-* "not" + *portus* "harbor, haven."  The sense evolution was likely from "not offering safe harbor" to "troublesome" to "to bother."
