Etymology:  From comfortable + -ity.  "Comfortable" comes from the late Middle English "confortable," from Old French "confortable," ultimately from Late Latin "confortabilis" ("strengthening"), from Latin "confortare" ("to strengthen"), from "com-" (together, with) + "fortis" (strong). The suffix "-ity" turns an adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.
