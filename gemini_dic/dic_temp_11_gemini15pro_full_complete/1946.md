Etymology:
"action" (n.) + "-packed" (adj. suffix meaning "full of"). "Action" comes from Old French "accion" and ultimately from Latin "actionem," meaning "a doing, a deed." "-packed" is a combination of "pack" (v.) and "-ed" (suffix forming adjectives). "Pack" comes from Middle Dutch "pakken," meaning "to pack, stow."
