ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle Dutch *dōre, perhaps from Old French dorée (“gilded”), feminine of doré, past participle of dorer (“to gild”), from Late Latin deaurāre, from Latin de- + aurāre (“to gild”), from aurum (“gold”).  The boat sense is likely a shortening of *dory-boat, from St. Peter's boat in the Bible.
