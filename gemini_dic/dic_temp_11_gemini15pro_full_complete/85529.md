ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *hæcc, from Proto-Germanic *hakō ("hook, latch"), from Proto-Indo-European *keg- ("hook, tooth").  The sense of "opening" developed from the notion of a hatch being closed by a latch or hook. The meaning related to eggs comes from the idea of a young bird breaking through its shell.
