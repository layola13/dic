donut's:/ˈdoʊnʌts/ | n. |甜甜圈（複数）| donut's is the possessive form of "donuts," indicating ownership or association.  It means "belonging to the donut" or "of the donut." However, using "donut's" is generally considered incorrect. The correct possessive form for plural nouns ending in "s" is typically just adding an apostrophe (donuts').  While "donut's" might be used informally or colloquially, it's best to avoid it in formal writing. | Example:  The donut's sprinkles were colorful. (Less common, better: The donuts' sprinkles were colorful.) 甜甜圈上的糖屑五颜六色。| Near synonyms: doughnuts | Antonyms: N/A | Noun
