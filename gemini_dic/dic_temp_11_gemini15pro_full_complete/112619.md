词源：The term "low-down" originated in American English in the late 19th century.  "Low" referring to something base or vulgar, and "down" emphasizing the secretive or hidden nature of the information.  It likely evolved from the phrase "low down," meaning literally close to the ground, and figuratively, getting to the bottom of things.
