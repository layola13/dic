activations:/ˌæktɪˈveɪʃənz/ | n. | 激活;启动;活化（activation的复数） | The process of making something active or operative.  It often refers to the initiation of a process or function.  In the context of machine learning, it refers to the output of a node in a neural network. |  The activations of the neurons in the hidden layer are then passed to the output layer. 隐藏层的激活值被传递到输出层。| synonyms:  stimulations, triggers, actuations | antonyms: deactivations, suppressions | noun
