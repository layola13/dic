PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It is most often used in direct comparison of venom potency.)


词源:  "Out-" (prefix meaning exceeding or surpassing) + "venom" (noun referring to poisonous secretion).  The word is a relatively recent formation, likely from the late 19th or early 20th century, built by analogy with words like "outdo" or "outperform."
