metacryst:/ˈmɛtəkrɪst/| n. |变晶; 后成晶体|A relatively large crystal embedded in a finer-grained matrix of the same mineral or different minerals. It forms later than the surrounding matrix, often by recrystallization. |Example 1: The metacryst of garnet stood out against the finer-grained schist.  石榴石变晶在细粒片岩中很突出。

Example 2: Metacrysts of plagioclase feldspar are common in some metamorphic rocks. 斜长石变晶在一些变质岩中很常见。|Synonym: porphyroblast|Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps groundmass if contrasting with the matrix) |Noun
