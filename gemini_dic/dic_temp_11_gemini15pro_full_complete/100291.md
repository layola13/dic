The word "intersertion" isn't a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) perhaps intended to combine "insertion" and "intersect."  Therefore, I will analyze "insertion" and "intersect" separately, and then speculate on the possible intended meaning of "intersertion."

**Insertion:**

/ɪnˈsɜːrʃən/ | n. | 插入；嵌入；插入物 | The act of inserting something or something that is inserted. |  He carefully made a small insertion in the wood for the gem. 他小心翼翼地在木头上开了一个小口，用来镶嵌宝石。|  They edited the video by the insertion of a few extra scenes. 他们通过插入几个额外的场景来编辑视频。| synonyms: addition, incorporation, implant | antonyms: removal, extraction, deletion | noun

**Intersect:**

/ˌɪntərˈsekt/ | v. | 相交；交叉；贯穿 | To cross or meet each other. | The two lines intersect at a right angle.  这两条线以直角相交。| Our paths intersected briefly at the conference. 我们的道路在会议上短暂地相遇。| synonyms: cross, meet, converge, overlap | antonyms: diverge, separate, parallel | verb


**Hypothetical "Intersertion":**

/ˌɪntərˈsɜːrʃən/ (Hypothetical) | n. |  交叉插入; 交叉嵌入 (推测) |  A hypothetical act of inserting something at the point of intersection. |  The intersertion of the new beam at the junction strengthened the structure.  (Hypothetical usage) 新梁在交叉点的插入加强了结构。 | The intersertion of the new genetic material at the specific chromosomal intersection resulted in a novel phenotype. (Hypothetical usage) 新遗传物质在特定染色体交叉点的插入导致了新的表型。| synonyms: (none established - could be similar to insertion and intersection) | antonyms: (none established) | noun (hypothetical)
