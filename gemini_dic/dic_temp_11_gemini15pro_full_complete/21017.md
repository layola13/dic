词源:
From Middle English *blessede, from Old English blēdsod (“blessed”), past participle of blētsian, blēdsian (“to bless, consecrate, hallow, dedicate; to praise, glorify, extol”), from Proto-Germanic *blōdisōną (“to mark with blood, hallow, bless”), equivalent to blood +‎ -sian. Cognate with Old Saxon blōdison (“to bless”), Old Norse bleza (“to bless”), Old High German bluozon (“to bless”). More at bless. The superlative suffix -est derives from Old English -ost, -est, from Proto-Germanic *-istaz.
