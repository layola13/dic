gametically:/ɡəˈmɛtɪkli/
adverb
通过配子地，在配子形成过程中
Relating to or involving gametes; in the manner of gametes.
Gametes are reproductive cells (sex cells) that unite during sexual reproduction to form a new cell called a zygote.  Gametically refers to processes, inheritance, or characteristics that are linked to or transmitted through these sex cells.
例句：The trait is inherited gametically.  这个特征是通过配子遗传的。

例句：The genes are segregated gametically during meiosis.  这些基因在减数分裂过程中通过配子分离。
近义词：through gametes, via gametes
反义词：somatically
词性：副词
