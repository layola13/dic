equivoluminal:/ˌiːkwɪvəˈluːmɪnəl/
adjective
等容的，等体积的
Having the same volume.  Referring to a process or change that occurs without a change in volume.
The equivoluminal contraction phase of the cardiac cycle is when the ventricles contract without a change in volume. 心脏循环的等容收缩阶段是指心室在体积不变的情况下收缩。
During the equivoluminal relaxation phase, the pressure in the ventricles drops but the volume remains constant. 在等容舒张阶段，心室内的压力下降，但体积保持不变。
Synonym: isovolumic, isometric (in the context of muscle contraction)
Antonym:  anisovolumic (rarely used)
