ETYMOLOGY->

From dis- + ingenuous + -ness.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of." "Ingenuous" comes from the Latin "ingenuus," meaning "inborn," "native," or "frank," later developing the sense of "noble" or "freeborn," and eventually coming to mean "frank" or "artless."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "ingenuous" into the noun "ingenuousness," meaning the quality of being ingenuous.  Therefore, "disingenuousness" is the lack of ingenuousness, meaning a lack of frankness or sincerity.
