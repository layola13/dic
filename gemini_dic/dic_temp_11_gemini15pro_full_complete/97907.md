注意事项:

"Innit" is highly informal and primarily used in British English, particularly in certain dialects and among younger speakers.  It is generally avoided in formal writing and speech.  While grammatically it relates to "isn't it?", its usage has broadened to tag onto various statements, not just those requiring the verb "to be".
