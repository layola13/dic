ETYMOLOGY->
From the Hungarian "kocsi," meaning "carriage" from the village of Kocs, where the carriages were made.  This evolved to refer to a horse-drawn carriage that transported people, then broadened metaphorically to mean something that conveys or carries something else, such as knowledge or skills. Thus, a "coach" became someone who "carries" or imparts knowledge to another.
