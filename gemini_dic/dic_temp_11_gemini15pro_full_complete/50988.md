ETYMOLOGY->
From desirable + -ness.  Desirable comes from Old French *desirable (modern French désirable), from Late Latin desiderabilis, from desiderare "to long for," from de- "intensive prefix" + siderare "to consider, observe the stars," from sidus (genitive sideris) "star, constellation."  The suffix -ness forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
