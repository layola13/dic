##oxybenzene 的详细解析n/ | /ˌɑːksiˈbɛnziːn/` | n. | 氧苯；苯酚 | Oxybenzene refers to a chemical compound containing both an oxygen atom and a benzene ring.  The mostcommon understanding of oxybenzene is phenol,  which has a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the benzene ring. However, the term is quite broad, asdifferent placements and types of oxygen-containing functional groups on the benzene ring would still technically qualify as oxybenzenes.  For instance, compounds like anisole (methoxybenzene) and phenetole (ethoxybenzene) could also beconsidered oxybenzenes. |  Phenol is used as a disinfectant and in the production of resins and plastics. | 近义词:  phenol (苯酚), hydroxybenzene (羟基苯) |  反义词:(无直接反义词，需根据具体上下文判断) | 名词," "acid," or "pointed."  In chemistry, it indicates the presence of oxygen, often in a functional group.oxybenzene" isn't as commonly used as "phenol," it is scientifically accurate and provides a broader classification encompassing a range of compounds.  It's primarily used in chemical contexts to refer to benzene derivatives containing oxygen.  In formal academic or scientific writing, specifying the exact location (e.g., ortho-,meta-, para-) and nature of the oxygen-containing group is crucial to avoid ambiguity.**oxybenzenes** showed promising antibacterial activity in vitro.
