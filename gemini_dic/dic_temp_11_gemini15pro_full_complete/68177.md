Etymology:
From Middle English *feintest, superlative of *feint, from Old French feint, feminine past participle of feindre "to feign, pretend," from Latin fingere "to shape, form, mold; devise, contrive, feign," from Proto-Indo-European *dʰeyǵʰ- "to knead, form."  The semantic shift from "feigned" to "weak, indistinct" occurred in Old French.  The superlative ending -est is a common Germanic suffix.
