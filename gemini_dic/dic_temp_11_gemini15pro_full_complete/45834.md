词源: custom (n.) + -ize (v.) + -ed (adj.)

custom: 来自古法语 costume, custume "custom, habit, usage," 源自拉丁语 consuetudinem (nominative consuetudo) "habit, usage, way of living," 来自 consuetus, past participle of consuescere "accustom, habituate," 字面意思是 "be accustomed together," 来自 com- "together" (参见 com-) + suescere "become accustomed," 与PIE *swed- "to be accustomed" 有关。

-ize: 来自希腊语 -izein，用于构成动词。

-ed: 形容词后缀，表示“具有...特性的”。
