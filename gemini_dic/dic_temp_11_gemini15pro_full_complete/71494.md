From Old French *flan, from Frankish *fladōn (“flat cake”), from Proto-Germanic *flaþō (“flat object”). Related to Old High German flado (“cake, sacrificial cake”), Old English flǣþe (“flat fish”). The Spanish flan comes from the Old French flan.  The word ultimately describes the flat, disc-like shape of the dessert.
