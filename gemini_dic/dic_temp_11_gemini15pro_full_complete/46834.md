daphnin:/ˈdæfnɪn/| n.|瑞香苷|A glycoside, C15H16O6, obtained from the bark and other parts of several species of Daphne, especially D. mezereum and D. alpina. It is a crystalline, slightly acrid, bitter substance.|Daphnin is a toxic compound found in some plants.|近义词:mezerein (a related compound)|反义词: (None applicable for a chemical compound)|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From *Daphne* (genus of flowering plants) + *-in* (suffix forming names of glycosides and other neutral principles). The genus name *Daphne* comes from Greek *δάφνη* (dáphnē), the laurel tree or bay tree, likely due to the similarity of the leaves of some Daphne species to those of the laurel.
