dereferencer:/diːˈrɛfərənsər/| n.|解引用器，指针解引用|A dereferencer is a programming tool or operation that accesses the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a pointer or reference.|The dereferencer operator * is used to access the value pointed to by the pointer.|近义词:pointer resolution|反义词:reference, pointer|词性:noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
A dereferencer accesses the value of a variable. = 解引用器访问变量的值。
The dereferencer operator returns the data stored at a specific memory address. = 解引用运算符返回存储在特定内存地址的数据。


现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is dereferencing the pointer to access the data. = 程序正在解引用指针以访问数据。
The system is currently dereferencing a null pointer, which will cause a crash. = 系统当前正在解引用一个空指针，这将导致崩溃。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The dereferencer has accessed the value successfully. = 解引用器已成功访问该值。
The program has dereferenced the pointer multiple times. = 程序已经多次解引用该指针。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The system has been dereferencing pointers continuously for hours. = 系统已经连续几个小时解引用指针。
The debugger has been dereferencing the same pointer repeatedly to track its value. = 调试器一直在重复解引用同一个指针以跟踪其值。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program dereferenced the pointer and retrieved the data. = 程序解引用了指针并检索了数据。
The function dereferenced the invalid pointer, causing an error. = 函数解引用了无效指针，导致错误。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was dereferencing the pointer when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，程序正在解引用指针。
The system was dereferencing a large number of pointers during the operation. = 操作期间，系统正在解引用大量指针。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had dereferenced the pointer before the error was detected. = 在检测到错误之前，程序已经解引用了指针。
The system had already dereferenced the pointer several times before the crash. = 在崩溃之前，系统已经多次解引用了指针。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been dereferencing the pointer for a long time before the crash. = 在崩溃之前，程序已经解引用指针很长时间了。
The system had been dereferencing invalid pointers repeatedly, leading to instability. = 系统一直在重复解引用无效指针，导致不稳定。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will dereference the pointer to access the data. = 程序将解引用指针以访问数据。
The function will dereference the pointer and return the value. = 函数将解引用指针并返回值。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be dereferencing pointers during the data processing. = 系统将在数据处理期间解引用指针。
The program will be dereferencing the pointer to update the value. = 程序将解引用指针以更新值。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the process, the program will have dereferenced all the pointers. = 到流程结束时，程序将解引用所有指针。
The system will have dereferenced the pointer multiple times before the operation completes. = 在操作完成之前，系统将多次解引用指针。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the system will have been dereferencing pointers continuously for a month. = 到下周，系统将已经连续一个月解引用指针。
The program will have been dereferencing the same pointer repeatedly for performance analysis. = 程序将重复解引用同一个指针以进行性能分析。


PHRASE->
pointer dereferencing = 指针解引用
dereferencing a null pointer = 解引用空指针
dereferencing an invalid pointer = 解引用无效指针
dereferencing a pointer to an object = 解引用指向对象的指针
dereferencing operator = 解引用运算符
