词源:
"Gish" likely originates from Yiddish slang, potentially related to the word "gornisht" (meaning "nothing"). Its evolution into a term for playful trickery remains somewhat obscure, lacking definitive etymological documentation.  The word gained popularity through the improvisational comedy game "The Harold," developed by Del Close and the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, where "gishes" refer to unexpected and often absurd actions or lines delivered by performers.
