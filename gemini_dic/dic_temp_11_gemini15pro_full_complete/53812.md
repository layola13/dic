disconformity:/ˌdɪskənˈfɔːrməti/ | n. |不整合|A break in a sedimentary sequence in which the older strata were not deformed or tilted prior to deposition of the younger strata, but there is evidence of erosion or non-deposition between the strata.| The disconformity between the two rock layers suggests a period of erosion. 这两层岩石之间的不整合表明存在一个侵蚀期。|Near synonyms: unconformity, break, gap, hiatus| Antonym: conformity| noun
