词源:  "facepalm" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, gaining popularity in the early 21st century through internet forums and social media. It combines the words "face" and "palm," literally describing the action.  Although the precise origin is unclear, it's believed to have emerged from online role-playing games and fan fiction.
