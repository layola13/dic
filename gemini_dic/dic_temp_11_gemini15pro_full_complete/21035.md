blighties: /ˈblaɪtiz/ | n. |英国; 故乡（尤指对在国外服役的英国士兵而言）| Britain; home, especially to British soldiers serving abroad |  He couldn't wait to get back to the Blighties after years of service in India. | 近义词: homeland, Britain, UK | 反义词: abroad, overseas | 词性: 名词


Etymology: Blighty is derived from the Hindi word "vilāyatī" (विलायती), meaning "foreign" or "European," which in turn comes from the Persian word "wilāyat" (ولایت), meaning "province" or "foreign land." During British rule in India, "bilāyatī" came to refer specifically to Britain. British soldiers adopted the term, and it evolved into "Blighty," retaining a sense of "home" or "native land."
