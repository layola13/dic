ETYMOLOGY->
From "jack" (a general term for a common man or tool) + "knife".  The term originally referred to a large, sturdy pocketknife suitable for general use.  The verb sense, referring to the folding action, developed later.  源自“jack”（一個指普通男人或工具的通用術語）+“knife”（刀）。該術語最初指的是一種適用於一般用途的大而堅固的袖珍小刀。指摺疊動作的動詞含義是後來發展起來的。
