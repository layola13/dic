##pseudobranchia 的详细解析suːdəʊˈbræŋkiə/ | n. | 假鳃 |Unlike true gills, which are involved in gas exchange, pseudobranchia primarily function in supplying oxygenated blood to the eye and other structures in the head region. They are thought to play a role in maintaining the oxygen supply to the retina and in regulating the temperature of the eye.  Their exact function is still a subject of ongoing research, and may vary across different species.  The structure resemblesa gill, hence the name "pseudo" (false) + "branchia" (gill).这条鱼的解剖显示了一个发育良好的假鳃，表明它可能适应其特定的环境。(There are no true synonyms, as pseudobranchia refers to a specific anatomical structure.)  辅助鳃 (a less precise, Chinese term)(true gill,  Chinese term)physiology.  The plural form is "pseudobranchiae".of various fish groups.  Understanding their function helps scientists learn more about  visual acuity, oxygen metabolism, and temperature regulation in fish.
