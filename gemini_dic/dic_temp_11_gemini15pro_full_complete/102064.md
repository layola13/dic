isomorphism:/ˌaɪsəˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同构，同形|A one-to-one correspondence between two sets, which preserves the relations existing between elements in the sets.|The isomorphism between the two groups allows us to study their properties interchangeably. 这两个群之间的同构性使我们可以互换地研究它们的性质。|Example: There is an isomorphism between the group of rotations of a circle and the group of complex numbers of modulus 1.  有一个圆的旋转群和模数为1的复数群之间的同构。

|synonym:  bijection, one-to-one correspondence, equivalence|antonym:  heteromorphism|noun
