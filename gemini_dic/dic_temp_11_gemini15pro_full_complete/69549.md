注意事项:

* "Fellowess" is not as commonly used as "fellow."  "Fellow" itself is often used as a gender-neutral term.  Using "female fellow" or "woman fellow" might be clearer and more widely accepted in modern usage.
*  The provided antonyms are contextual; there isn't a direct opposite of "fellowess."
