multisets:/ˈmʌltiˌsɛts/ | n. |多重集| A multiset (also called a bag) is a generalization of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows multiple instances of the multiset's elements. The multiplicity of an element is the number of instances of the element in a specific multiset. | The multiset {a, a, b} contains two instances of a and one of b. | 近义词: bag | 反义词: set | 词性: noun
