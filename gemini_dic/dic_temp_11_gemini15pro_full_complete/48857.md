deformation's:/ˌdiːfɔːrˈmeɪʃənz/ | n. | 变形，形变 | The deformation's extent was measured using specialized equipment.  变形程度是用专门的设备测量的。|  例句：The metal bar underwent permanent deformation's after being subjected to high pressure.  金属棒在承受高压后发生了永久变形。

The building's deformation's were caused by the earthquake.  这座建筑的变形是由地震引起的。 | 近义词：distortion, contortion, warp | 反义词： reformation, restoration | 词性: 名词 (Noun), 所有格形式

词源: Late Middle English: from Old French deformacion, from Latin deformatio(n-), from the verb deformare (see deform).

用法说明:
"Deformation's" is the possessive form of "deformation," meaning it indicates ownership or association. It is less commonly used than the singular "deformation" or the plural "deformations." It is used when you want to specify that the deformation belongs to a specific singular entity.
