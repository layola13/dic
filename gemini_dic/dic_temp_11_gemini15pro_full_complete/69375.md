PHRASE->
N/A (fee'd is not commonly used in phrases.  The base form "fee" is used, e.g., "legal fees," "membership fee")

注意事项:
Since "fee'd" is the past participle of "fee", it doesn't have separate tenses. It's used in perfect tenses and passive voice constructions.  It's less common than "paid" in everyday usage.  You are more likely to see "have paid the fee" than "have fee'd the lawyer."
