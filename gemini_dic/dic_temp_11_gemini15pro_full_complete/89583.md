ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *hōd (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *hōdō, from Proto-Indo-European *keh₂- (“to cover, conceal”). Cognate with Old Norse hǫttr (“hood”), Old High German huot (“hat”), German Hut (“hat”).  The sense of "neighborhood" arose in American English in the 20th century, likely from the idea of a shared identity or "covering" within a specific area.
