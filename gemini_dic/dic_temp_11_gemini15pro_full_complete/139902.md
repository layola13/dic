ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *od, from Old Norse odr (“point, spearhead, triangle; odd number”), from Proto-Germanic *uzdaz (“pointed, sharp”), from Proto-Indo-European *h₂udʰrós (“udder; pointed, sharp”). Cognate with Old English ord (“point, beginning, source, spearhead”), Old Frisian ord (“point, place, position”), Old Saxon ord (“point, spearhead, beginning, origin”), Old High German ort (“point, place, position”), German Ort (“place”). More at ord.
The sense development is perhaps from the idea of a triangle being the first closed figure with an odd number of angles, or more directly from the use of a pointed object to mark or count, whence the singular or odd one left over.
