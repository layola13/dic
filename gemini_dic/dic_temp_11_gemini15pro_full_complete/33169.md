注意事项:

"chromi" itself is not a formally recognized word.  It is likely used informally as a shortened form of "chromium" or as a combining form related to chromium compounds.  Therefore, the provided information assumes this informal usage and focuses on the element chromium and its related compounds.  For precise scientific or technical communication, using the full term "chromium" or specific chromium compound names is recommended.
