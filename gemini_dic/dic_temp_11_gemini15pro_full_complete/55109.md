Etymology:
dis- (prefix): apart, asunder, away, utterly, not. From Old French des-, dis-, from Latin dis- “apart, asunder,” also “not, un-,” from PIE *dwis- “twice, double” (also source of Sanskrit dvi-, Greek di-, Old English twi-).  The sense evolution in Latin seems to have been "double" -> "in two parts" -> "apart."
root (n. and v.): Old Norse rot "root," from Proto-Germanic *wrot (source also of Old English wyrt "root, herb, plant," Old Frisian wurt "root," Old Saxon wrot, Middle Dutch wortel, Dutch wortel, Old High German wurz, German Wurzel "root"), from PIE *wrd- "root, branch" (source also of Latin radix "root").
