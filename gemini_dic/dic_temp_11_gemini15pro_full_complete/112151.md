词性: phrasal verb

词源:  The phrasal verb "look down on" is formed from the verb "look" and the adverbial particle "down on." "Look" has its origins in Old English "lōcian," meaning "to see, behold." "Down" also comes from Old English "dūn," relating to a descending direction. "On" is from Old English "on," indicating position or direction.  The combination of these words creates the figurative sense of looking from a superior position, thus implying disdain or condescension.
