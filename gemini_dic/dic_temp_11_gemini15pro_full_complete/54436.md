From dis- + inflation + -'s (possessive).  "Dis-" is a Latin prefix meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force. "Inflation" comes from the Late Latin inflatio, from inflat- (past participle stem of inflare "to inflate"), from in- "in" + flare "to blow."
