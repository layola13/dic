词源:  From Middle English *barberie, from Old French barbier, from Late Latin barberia, from Latin barba (“beard”). Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bʰardʰā (“beard”).  The meaning "barber shop" is derived from the fact that barbers historically also performed minor surgeries, including bloodletting, and the barberry plant was used medicinally for its astringent properties.
