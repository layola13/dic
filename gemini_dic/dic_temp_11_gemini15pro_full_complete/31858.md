ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *cherfulnes*, derived from *cherful* (cheerful) + *-nes* (suffix forming abstract nouns of quality).  *Cherful* comes from Old English *ceorful* "full of care, anxious," with a semantic shift to "glad, joyful" influenced by Old Norse *kjarfullr* "dear, beloved," ultimately from Proto-Germanic *kerą* "care, anxiety" (source also of Old English *cearu* "care, sorrow"). The shift in meaning likely occurred through the intermediate sense of "dearly loved," which implied happiness.
