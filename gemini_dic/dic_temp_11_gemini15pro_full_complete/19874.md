词源:  The origin of "bingo" is uncertain, but it likely derives from earlier forms of lottery or lotto. One theory suggests it comes from a similar game played in the early 20th century where players would mark their cards with beans and shout "Beano!" when they won.  When the game was commercialized, the name supposedly evolved to "Bingo," possibly through a mishearing or deliberate change.
