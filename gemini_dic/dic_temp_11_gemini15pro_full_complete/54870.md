PHRASE->
(While phrases with "displeasingly" are grammatically correct, they are not commonly used.  It's more natural to use the adverb to modify a verb directly.)

Instead of focusing on phrases, here are some alternative ways to express similar sentiments, which are more common:

1. in a displeasing manner
2. to act displeasingly
3. a displeasingly high price
4. speak displeasingly of someone
5. behave displeasingly towards someone


词源: From dis- + pleasing + -ly.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."  "Pleasing" comes from the verb "please," ultimately from Latin "placere" meaning "to be agreeable to."  "-ly" is a suffix that forms adverbs.
