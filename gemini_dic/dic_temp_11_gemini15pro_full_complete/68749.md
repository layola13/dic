词源:  Old English *feorm, *fearm "provisions, food, feast, shelter, protection," also "lease, rent," from Proto-Germanic *fermaz (source also of Old Frisian ferm "living, livelihood," Old Saxon felm, Old High German farma "food, provisions"), from PIE root *per- (1) "to traffic, sell." The sense evolution is from "provision, food supplied as rent" to "land providing food, rented land" (c. 1300).
