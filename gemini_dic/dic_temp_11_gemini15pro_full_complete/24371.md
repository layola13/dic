Etymology:
"bring" comes from Old English "bringan," meaning "to carry, convey, lead." "terms" comes from Old French "termes," meaning "end, limit, boundary," ultimately from Latin "terminus." The phrasal verb "bring to terms" combines these meanings to convey the idea of bringing someone to a point of acceptance or agreement, often involving boundaries or limitations.
