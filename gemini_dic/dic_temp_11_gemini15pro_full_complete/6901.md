ETYMOLOGY->
"anchor" (n.) - from Old English *ancor, from Latin ancora, from Greek ankura "an anchor," probably of Semitic origin (compare Arabic angar "anchor").  The metaphorical sense of "something that provides stability or security" developed later.
"man" (n.) - from Old English man, mann "human being, person (male or female); brave man, hero," from Proto-Germanic *mann- (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Dutch man, Old High German man, German Mann, Old Norse maðr, Gothic manna "man").  

The term "anchorman" arose in the mid-20th century with the development of television news broadcasting, using "anchor" in its metaphorical sense of providing stability and holding the news program together.  The female equivalent, "anchorwoman," appeared later.
