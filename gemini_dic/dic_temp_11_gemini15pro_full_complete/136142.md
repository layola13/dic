nonrefractively:/ˌnɒnriˈfræktɪvli/
adverb
非折射地
in a manner that does not cause refraction (the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another).
The light passed through the material nonrefractively. 光线非折射地穿过了这种材料。
Synonym: directly, straight
Antonym: refractively
词性: 副词


Etymology:
non- (prefix meaning "not") + refractive + -ly (adverb suffix)
"non-" comes from Latin "non" (not).
"refractive" comes from Latin "refringere" (to break back), from "re-" (back) + "frangere" (to break).
