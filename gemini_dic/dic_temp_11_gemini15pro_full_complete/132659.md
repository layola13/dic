词源：
Non- (prefix meaning "not") + disingenuous + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality).  Disingenuous comes from the Latin dis- (expressing negation) + ingenuus ("native, freeborn, noble, frank, sincere").  Therefore, nondisingenuousness represents the negation of the negation of sincerity, resulting in sincerity itself.
