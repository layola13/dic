From Old French "franchise" (freedom, liberty, privilege), from "franc" (free), from Frankish "*frank" (free), from Proto-Germanic "*frankaz" (free).  The word originally referred to the freedoms granted to a town or individual by a monarch. Later, it evolved to mean the right to vote and then the business model we know today.
