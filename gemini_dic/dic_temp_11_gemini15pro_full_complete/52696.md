digonous:/daɪˈɡɒnəs/
adjective
二角形的，有两角的
Having two angles or corners.  Relating to or characterized by two angles.
A digonous figure is a polygon with two sides and two angles, which is degenerate in Euclidean geometry but can exist in spherical geometry.  A digon on a sphere is formed by two great circle arcs which intersect at two antipodal points.
Example:  While difficult to visualize in planar geometry, a digon can be readily understood as a shape on the surface of a sphere.
Example: Imagine two lines of longitude meeting at the north and south poles; this forms a digon.
近义词:biangular
