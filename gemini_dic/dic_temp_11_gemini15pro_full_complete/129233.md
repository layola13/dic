noctilucin:/nɒktɪˈluːsɪn/ | n. |夜光素; 发光蛋白 |A protein that produces bioluminescence in certain organisms, especially dinoflagellates.| The noctilucin in the dinoflagellates caused the ocean to glow at night. 夜光藻中的夜光素使海洋在夜间发光。|Synonyms: luciferin, photoprotein | Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific protein. One could consider "non-luminescent protein" but that's not a single word.) | noun
