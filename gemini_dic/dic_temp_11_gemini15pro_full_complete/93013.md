Etymology->
From Middle French *idiote*, from Latin *idiota* "ordinary person, layman; uneducated person," from Greek *idiōtēs* "private person, layman, ignorant person," from *idios* "one's own, private."  Originally, an "idiot" was simply a private citizen, as opposed to someone holding public office.  Over time, the word acquired its pejorative meaning, implying a lack of intelligence or common sense.
