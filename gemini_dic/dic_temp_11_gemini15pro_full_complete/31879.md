cheerlessness: /ˈtʃɪrləsnəs/ | n. | 忧郁，沉闷，不快乐 |  The state of being without cheer; gloominess; dreariness.  It describes an atmosphere or mood lacking happiness or joy. | The cheerlessness of the November day made everyone feel down.  十一月这天的沉闷让每个人都感到沮丧。| synonyms: gloom, dejection, melancholy, despondency, bleakness | antonyms: cheerfulness, happiness, joy, lightheartedness, gaiety | noun


Etymology:
From cheerless + -ness.  Cheerless itself comes from cheer + -less.  "Cheer" ultimately derives from Old French "chiere" meaning "face, countenance."  The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something, and "-ness" turns an adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.
