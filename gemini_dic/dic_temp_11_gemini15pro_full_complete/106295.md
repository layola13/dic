词源:
"Knuff" is a word of Dutch or Afrikaans origin, likely related to the Dutch word "knuffelen" which means to cuddle or hug. While "knuff" retains a sense of physical contact, it refers to a push or nudge rather than an embrace.  "knuff" 来自荷兰语或南非荷兰语，可能与荷兰语单词 "knuffelen" 相关，意思是拥抱或搂抱。 虽然 "knuff" 保留了身体接触的含义，但它指的是推或轻推，而不是拥抱。
