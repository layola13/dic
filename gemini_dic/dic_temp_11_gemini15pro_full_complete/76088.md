Etymology:
From furry + -ness.  "Furry" comes from the Middle English "furri," from Old English "fyrht," meaning "frightened, timid." This likely refers to the bristling of fur when an animal is frightened.  The meaning shifted to refer to the fur itself. "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
