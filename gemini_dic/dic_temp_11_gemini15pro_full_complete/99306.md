PHRASE->
(Due to the sensitive nature of the word "intercourse," common phrases directly using it are rare and often vulgar.  Therefore, I will provide phrases related to the more general meaning of interaction and communication.)

diplomatic intercourse = 外交往来
social intercourse = 社交
commercial intercourse = 商业往来
sexual intercourse = 性交


注意事项:

* The word "intercourse" is primarily used in formal contexts, especially when referring to dealings between groups or nations.  When referring to sexual relations, it is generally considered more formal and less common than terms like "sex" or "lovemaking."  In casual conversation, using "intercourse" to refer to sex can sometimes sound awkward or even euphemistic.  Care should be taken when using this word due to its potential for misinterpretation.
