ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *incumbent-, incumbens, present participle of incumbere "to lie on, lean on, press upon, apply oneself to," from in- "on" + -cumbere "lie down," related to cubare "to lie." The sense of "currently holding office" arose from the notion of someone "leaning on" or "resting on" the responsibility of the office.
