ETYMOLOGY->
From assail + -able + -ness.  "Assail" comes from Old French "asaillir,"  meaning "to leap upon," ultimately from Latin "assilire,"  from "ad-" (to) + "salire" (to leap). "-able" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of being," from Old French "-able" and Latin "-abilis." "-ness" is a native English suffix forming nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition.
