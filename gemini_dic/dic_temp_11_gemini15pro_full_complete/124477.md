mouldability's:/ˌmoʊldəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可塑性，成形性 | The mouldability's of clay makes it ideal for sculpting.  黏土的可塑性使它非常适合雕塑。|  The product's mouldability's is a key factor in its manufacturing process. 该产品的可塑性是其制造过程中的关键因素。 | 近义词: plasticity, malleability, flexibility | 反义词: rigidity, inflexibility | 词性: 名词

词源: mouldability + 's (possessive)
From mouldable + -ity + 's.  Mouldable comes from mould (shape) + -able (capable of being).  Ultimately from Old French *moldre (to grind), from Latin molere. The possessive 's indicates the quality of mouldability belonging to something specific, although this usage is somewhat unusual and might be better expressed with "the mouldability of".
