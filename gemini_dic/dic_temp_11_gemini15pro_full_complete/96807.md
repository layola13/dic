inertiae:/ɪˈnɜːrʃiiː/ /ɪˈnɜːrʃiˌeɪ/ | n. |惯性，惰性 |The plural form of inertia, a Latin word.  It refers to the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. In physics, it's often used in the plural in more technical contexts, especially when discussing tensors and matrices. |The *inertiae* of the system made it difficult to implement changes quickly. 系统的惯性使得快速实施更改变得困难。|Synonym: (singular) inertia, inactivity, torpor |Antonym: (singular) activity, energy, dynamism |Noun
