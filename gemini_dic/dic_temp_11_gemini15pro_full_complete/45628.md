ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *curs, from Proto-Germanic *kursaz, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱer- (to cry out). Related to the Old Norse kurr ("grumbling") and the Middle High German kurz ("short, abrupt"). The original sense was likely a sharp utterance of anger or disapproval, later evolving to include supernatural connotations.
