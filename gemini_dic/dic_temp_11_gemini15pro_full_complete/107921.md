PHRASE->

(Since "lary" is a medical term, common phrases using it directly are rare.  It's more likely to be part of a longer phrase describing a specific condition like "laryngeal cancer" or "laryngeal inflammation."  Therefore, the following are phrases related to the throat/larynx area, not directly using "lary"):

sore throat = 喉咙痛
clear your throat = 清嗓子
lose your voice = 失声
throat lozenge = 喉咙含片
lump in your throat = 哽咽的感觉
