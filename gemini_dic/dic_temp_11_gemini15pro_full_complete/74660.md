Etymology:  From "free wheel" (n.) + "-ing" (suffix forming present participles and adjectives). "Free wheel" refers to a mechanism on a bicycle or other vehicle that allows the driven wheels to rotate independently of the pedals or driving mechanism, thus allowing coasting. The figurative sense of "acting without restraint" developed from this idea.
