Etymology: From the adjective "fey," derived from Middle English *fay* (influenced by Old French *fae*), ultimately from Old English *fæge* meaning "fated to die," then later "doomed, ill-fated, marked by death."  The sense shifted to "visionary, clairvoyant" then to "whimsical, otherworldly."  The adverbial suffix "-ly" was added to form "feyly."
