backtracker:/ˈbækˌtrækər/| n.|回溯算法，回溯者|A backtracker is an algorithm or a person who uses a backtracking algorithm. This algorithm solves problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.|The programmer used a backtracker to solve the Sudoku puzzle.|近义词：backtracking algorithm, depth-first search|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps iterative algorithm)|词性:noun
