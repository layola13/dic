overconsolidation:/ˌoʊvərˌkɑːnˌsɑːlɪˈdeɪʃən/ | n. | 超固结；过固结 |The state of a soil that has been subjected to a greater pressure than the present overburden. This results in a lower void ratio, higher shear strength, and lower compressibility than normally consolidated soil. | The overconsolidation of the clay layer contributed to the stability of the foundation.  这层粘土的超固结作用有助于地基的稳定性。| Synonyms: preconsolidation | Antonyms: underconsolidation | noun


overconsolidation:/ˌoʊvərˌkɑːnˌsɑːlɪˈdeɪʃən/ | adj. | 超固结的 |Describing a soil that has been overconsolidated. | The overconsolidated clay exhibited high shear strength. 超固结粘土表现出高抗剪强度。| Synonyms: preconsolidated | Antonyms: underconsolidated | adjective
