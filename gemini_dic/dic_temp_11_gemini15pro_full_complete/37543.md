PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's primarily an adverb describing the *manner* of something, not combined with other words to form set phrases.) It's more natural to use its synonyms in phrases. For example, instead of "commonplacely say," one would more likely say "ordinarily say" or "routinely say."  Therefore, providing phrases is difficult and would sound forced.  It's best understood through its usage as an adverb.
