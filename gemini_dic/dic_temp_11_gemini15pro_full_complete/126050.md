注意事项:

* "Mustaiba" primarily refers to the oil, not the seeds themselves.  "Mustard seeds" are referred to as "rai" (Hindi) or "sarso" (Hindi).
* While "mustard oil" is a common synonym, in some regions, "mustard oil" might refer to an essential oil derived from mustard seeds, which is quite pungent and used medicinally, rather than the cooking oil.  "Mustaiba" more clearly refers to the cooking oil.
