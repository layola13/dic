注意事项:
"Europan" (with a lowercase "e") is sometimes used, particularly in science fiction, to refer to a hypothetical inhabitant of Jupiter's moon Europa.  However, in common usage relating to Europe or its people, "European" (with a capital "E") is the standard and correct spelling.  This analysis focuses on the more common usage relating to Europe.
