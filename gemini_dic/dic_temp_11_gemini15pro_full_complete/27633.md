cand:/kænd/ | n. | 糖果；蜜饯；砂糖 | A sweet food made with sugar and often flavouring or fruit. |  She gave the child a piece of cand. 她给了孩子一块糖。| Synonyms: sweet, confection, candy | Antonyms: savory, unsweetened | Noun


Etymology:
From Middle English *cand*, from Old French *quand*, variant of *quant*, from Latin *quando* (“when”). The semantic shift likely occurred through the use of candied spices and fruits in medieval apothecaries, which were dispensed "when" (quando) needed.  Later, the term became generalized to refer to any sweet confection.
