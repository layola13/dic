词源:  "hangability" + "-ities" (plural suffix).  "Hangability" comes from "hangable" (capable of being hanged) + "-ity" (suffix forming abstract nouns). "Hangable" derives from "hang" + "-able" (suffix meaning "capable of being").  Therefore, "hangabilities" refers to the multiple instances or aspects of something's ability to be hung.

用法说明:
"Hangabilities" is a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in technical or specialized contexts where the ability of something to be hung is a relevant property, such as in discussions of textiles, artwork, or display systems. It implies more than just the simple ability to be suspended; it often suggests an assessment of how well or easily something hangs, including factors like drape, balance, and stability.
