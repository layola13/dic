Etymology:
From inter- (between) + continental (relating to a continent).  "Inter-" comes from Latin, meaning "between, among, in the midst of, during, mutually, reciprocally," from PIE *enter- "between, among."  "Continental" comes from Late Latin continentalis, from continens (genitive continentis) "holding together, continuous,"  from continere "to hold together, enclose, contain."
