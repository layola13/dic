homoplast:/ˈhɒməˌplæst/ /ˈhoʊməˌplæst/ | n. | 同塑性,同质体 |A character shared by a set of species but not present in their common ancestor. A good example is the evolution of the eye which has originated independently in many different species.  |The wings of bats and birds are homoplasts because they evolved convergently, not from a shared winged ancestor.| 近义词:analogue, analogous structure | 反义词:homolog, homologous structure | noun
