cross-bedding:/ˈkrɒsˌbɛdɪŋ/ (US) /ˈkrɒsˌbedɪŋ/ (UK)| n.| 交错层理 |The arrangement of layers within a stratum at an angle to the main bedding plane, indicative of sediment transport by currents, typically by wind or water.  This structure is formed as inclined layers of sediment are deposited by flowing water or wind.| The geologist identified cross-bedding in the sandstone, indicating an ancient riverbed. 地质学家在砂岩中发现了交错层理，表明这是一个古老的河床。| Synonyms: cross-stratification| Antonyms: parallel bedding| Noun
