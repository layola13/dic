The word "listel" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's possible there's a typo, or it's a very specialized term.  Did you perhaps mean "listen," "list," or "libel"?  I can provide information for those words.

If you meant **listen**:

listen: /ˈlɪsən/ | v. | 听 | To pay attention to sound; to hear something with thoughtful attention. |  例句：Listen to the music. 听音乐。 | 近义词: hear, attend | 反义词: ignore, disregard | 词性: verb
