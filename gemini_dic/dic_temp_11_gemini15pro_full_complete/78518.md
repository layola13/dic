Etymology:  From ghetto + -ing.  Ghetto comes from Italian ghetto, perhaps from Venetian dialect  ghèto “foundry” (near the site of the first ghetto in Venice), or from Italian gettare "to throw, cast,"  referring to the casting of metal or possibly to the discarding of waste in the area.  The earliest ghettoes were established in Venice in 1516.
