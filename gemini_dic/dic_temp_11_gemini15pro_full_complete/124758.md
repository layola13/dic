mro:/ˈɛmˌɑːrˈoʊ/| n.| 方法解析顺序 (Method Resolution Order)|Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which a programming language searches for a method in a hierarchy of classes or objects. It is particularly relevant in languages that support multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.|The MRO of this class is A, B, C.|近义词: inheritance hierarchy, linearization|反义词: None|词性: noun
