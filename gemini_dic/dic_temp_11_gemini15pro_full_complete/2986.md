词源:  Aemotion appears to be a relatively recent coinage, likely formed by blending "emotion" with the intensifying prefix "a-" (as in "arouse," "awake").  It lacks a long etymological history like many traditional English words.  Its usage suggests an attempt to convey a heightened sense of emotional excitement and enthusiasm beyond the standard meaning of "emotion."
