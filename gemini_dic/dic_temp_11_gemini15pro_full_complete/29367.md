ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *crecelle*, a diminutive of *crecele* "rattle," referring to the bird's cry, from Vulgar Latin *crepitiola*, diminutive of Latin *crepitus* "rattling, creaking."  The spelling shifted to "castrel" by association with Old Northern French *quercerelle* "kestrel," influenced by the word "cast" (perhaps alluding to the bird's hunting technique).
