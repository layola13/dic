词源: From French excitant, present participle of exciter (“to excite”), from Latin excitare (“to rouse, stir up”).

注意事项:  Excitant is less commonly used than "exciting" or "stimulating". While "exciting" focuses on the feeling evoked, "excitant" refers more to the agent or cause of excitement.  As a noun, it often refers to a substance that produces a physiological response.
