isentropic:/ˌaɪsənˈtrɒpɪk/ /ˌaɪsənˈtrɑːpɪk/| adj.|等熵的|Relating to a process that occurs without any change in entropy.  A process is isentropic if it is both adiabatic (no heat exchange) and reversible (no energy losses due to friction or other dissipative effects).|The compression stage in an ideal gas turbine engine is assumed to be isentropic.  理想燃气涡轮发动机的压缩阶段被假定为等熵的。

The expansion of the gas through the nozzle was nearly isentropic.  气体通过喷嘴的膨胀几乎是等熵的。|近义词：adiabatic (under certain conditions)|反义词: non-isentropic|词性: adjective
