ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *interpretatus, past participle of interpretari ("to explain, expound, translate"), from interpres ("broker, negotiator, translator, explainer") + -ari (verb-forming suffix). The Latin word is borrowed from Etruscan, perhaps from a compound of Turkic *til- ("tongue") and *maz- ("to strike, to forge").
