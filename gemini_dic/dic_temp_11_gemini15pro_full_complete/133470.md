n.|非虚弱；强壮|The nonfeebleness of her spirit impressed everyone. 她坚强的精神给每个人都留下了深刻的印象.| strength, robustness, vigor|feebleness, weakness, frailty|noun

Etymology:
non- (prefix):  Meaning "not," from Old French non-, from Latin non "not," originally ne oinom (ne unum "not one").
feeble (adjective): From Old French feble, foible (Modern French faible), from Late Latin flebilis "lamentable," from Latin flere "to weep." The semantic shift from "lamentable" to "weak" likely occurred through the notion of someone weak enough to evoke pity.
-ness (suffix):  Forms nouns meaning "state or quality of being," from Old English -nes, -nis.
