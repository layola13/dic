注意事项：

* "gadoliniums" itself isn't grammatically correct. The element is referred to as "gadolinium," even when discussing multiple atoms or ions of the element.  The plural form isn't used.  Therefore, all examples use "gadolinium".
* There aren't true synonyms or antonyms for a specific chemical element.
