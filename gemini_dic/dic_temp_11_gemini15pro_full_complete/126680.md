Etymology:  Likely a reduplication of "nam," a dialectal variant of "nim" or "nimmy," meaning "timid" or "finicky," combined with "pamby," possibly related to "pampy," meaning "spoiled" or "overindulged."  This creates a rhyming and somewhat childish-sounding term that reinforces the sense of weakness and immaturity.
