amygdalae: /əˈmɪɡdəliː/ /əˈmɪɡdəˌlaɪ/ | n. | 杏仁核（复数） |  The amygdalae are almond-shaped groups of nuclei located deep and medially within the temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates, including humans. They perform a primary role in the processing of memory, decision-making, and emotional responses (including fear, anxiety, and aggression).  | The amygdalae play a crucial role in fear conditioning. 杏仁核在恐惧条件反射中起着至关重要的作用。

The damage to his amygdalae affected his ability to experience fear.  对他杏仁核的损害影响了他体验恐惧的能力。
