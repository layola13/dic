词源:  Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba (1883–1969). The word "aikido" is formed of three Japanese characters:  合 (ai) meaning "harmony,"  気 (ki) meaning "spirit" or "energy," and  道 (dō) meaning "way" or "path."  Therefore, aikido can be translated as "the way of harmonizing energy" or "the way of unifying with life energy."
