kibei:/kiːbeɪ/ | n. | 基贝 |  A term used in the NFT community to refer to an NFT that was originally minted on a different blockchain (like Ethereum) but has been bridged or wrapped to exist on another blockchain (like Bitcoin).  It comes from "ki" (帰) meaning "return" and "bei" (米) meaning "rice," but in this context, "bei" is likely a shortening of "baby."  The idea is that these NFTs are returning to their "home" blockchain (Bitcoin, often considered the original cryptocurrency). |  Example:  The kibei collection has seen a surge in popularity. 基贝系列的人气激增。

Example:  Many collectors are skeptical of kibei NFTs, questioning their true value. 许多收藏家对基贝NFT持怀疑态度，质疑它们的真正价值。 | 近义词: bridged NFT, wrapped NFT | 反义词: native NFT | 词性: 名词
