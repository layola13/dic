词源:  "mistering" is derived from the verb "to mister," which is a back-formation from the noun "mister" (Mr.).  While "mister" is commonly used as a title of respect for men, the verb "to mister" and the gerund "mistering" are less common and  refer to the act of making something mysterious or obscure, often by withholding information or creating an aura of secrecy.
