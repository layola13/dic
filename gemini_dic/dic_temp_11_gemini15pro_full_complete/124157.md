Etymology:
From Anglo-French *mort main* "dead hand," from the idea that land held by a corporation, especially the Church, was considered "dead" to the feudal lord because it could not be transferred or inherited, and thus he lost out on potential feudal dues.  Ultimately from Latin *mortua manus* "dead hand."
