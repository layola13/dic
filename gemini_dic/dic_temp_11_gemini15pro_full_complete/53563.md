注意事项:
* "Disbelief's" is not a commonly used word.  "Disbelief" is the standard form.  The possessive form ("disbelief's") is only used when describing something belonging to or originating from disbelief itself (e.g., "disbelief's power").  It is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward.  Rephrasing is often preferred.
* The provided examples use "disbelief's" as requested, but in natural English, these sentences would often be rephrased. For instance, "His disbelief's obvious" would be better as "His disbelief is obvious" or "He is clearly in disbelief."
