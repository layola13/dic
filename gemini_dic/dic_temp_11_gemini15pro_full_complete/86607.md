heliopora:/ˌhiːliˈɒpərə/ | n. | 蓝珊瑚 | A genus of corals, the only genus in the family Helioporidae, commonly known as blue coral.  It is unique among reef-building corals because its skeleton is made of aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, and contains iron salts that give it a distinctive blue colour. |  Example 1: The heliopora colonies thrived in the shallow, sunlit waters. 蓝珊瑚群落在阳光充足的浅水中繁衍生息。

Example 2:  Researchers are studying the growth patterns of heliopora to understand its resilience to changing ocean conditions. 研究人员正在研究蓝珊瑚的生长模式，以了解其对不断变化的海洋条件的适应力。 | 近义词: blue coral (this is more of a descriptive name than a synonym) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *hēlios* (ἥλιος) "sun" + *poros* (πόρος) "passage, pore".  The name refers to the numerous pores visible on the surface of the coral.
