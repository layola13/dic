注意事项:
词源:  "Nonerratically" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "erratic" (meaning "irregular or unpredictable"). "Erratic" itself derives from the Latin word "errare," meaning "to wander" or "to err."  “nonerratically”来自前缀“non-”（意思是“不”）和形容词“erratic”（意思是“不规则的或不可预测的”）。“erratic”本身源自拉丁语单词“errare”，意思是“徘徊”或“犯错”。
