The word "lianteef" does not appear to be a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a typo or it's a word from another language.  If you can provide more context or clarify the spelling, I can try to help.

Since I cannot analyze "lianteef," I'll use the word "happen" as a demonstration of the requested format.


happen:/ˈhæpən/
verb
发生，出现
to occur, to take place
例句：The accident happened so quickly. 事故发生得太快了。

例句：What happened to your car?  你的车怎么了？

近义词：occur, take place, transpire
反义词：cease, stop

It just so happens that = 恰好
