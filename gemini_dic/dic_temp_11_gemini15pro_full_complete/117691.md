注意事项:

"melada" appears to be a Spanish word, not English.  The analysis provided is based on the assumption that it is being used in an English context with its Spanish meaning.  If you intended a different word, please clarify.  The etymology likely traces back to Latin "mel" (honey) through Portuguese "marmelada" (quince jam), eventually leading to the Spanish "melada".
