atomicity:/ˌætəˈmɪsəti/ | n. |原子性; 不可分割性 | The property of transactions to be either entirely completed or entirely canceled, ensuring data consistency.  It means that a group of operations either all happen successfully or none of them do, and if an error occurs during the process, the data is rolled back to its previous state.| Database transactions require atomicity to maintain data integrity. 数据库事务需要原子性来维护数据完整性。| synonyms: indivisibility, unity, all-or-nothing | antonyms: divisibility, separability | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *atomicitas, from Latin atomus ("atom") + -itas ("-ity").

USAGE->
