词源:  Likely derived from "fair," with the suffix "-is" possibly influenced by words like "festive."  A definitive etymology is difficult to establish, as "feris" is not a widely recognized standard English word.  It's likely a colloquial or dialectal term, or perhaps a neologism.  It's important to note that while understandable in context, it might be considered informal or even non-standard in formal writing.
