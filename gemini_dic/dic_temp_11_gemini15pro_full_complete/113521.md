词源：
"Mobility as a Service" (MaaS) is a relatively recent term, coined in the early 21st century, with its roots in the broader concept of "X as a Service" (XaaS).  The exact origin is debated, but Finland is often credited with pioneering its development and implementation.  "Metal as a Service" (MaaS) is an even newer term, building on the same XaaS model and referring to the provision of metal resources on demand.  It lacks a clear single origin but is emerging within the context of cloud computing and industrial digitalization.
