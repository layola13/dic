"bolan" isn't a recognized English word.  It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun (like a place name), or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary entry for it.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a name, I could help you with its pronunciation or origin.  If it's from another language, I might be able to translate it.
