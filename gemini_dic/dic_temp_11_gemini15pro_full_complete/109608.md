ETYMOLOGY->
The phrase "let on" likely originates from the older sense of "let" meaning "to allow" or "to cause." "On" in this context likely evolved from its use in phrasal verbs implying continuation or progression, like "carry on" or "go on."  The combination suggests allowing something to become known or to continue a pretense.
