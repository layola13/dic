词源:  Gelders derives from Gelderland, the name of a province in the Netherlands.  Gelderland itself has a complex etymology, potentially originating from a combination of Germanic elements meaning "yielding land" or "good land."


注意事项:
"Gelders" is capitalized when referring to the province or its people/language, but lowercase when used as a general adjective (e.g., "gelders horse").  It is relatively uncommon outside the Netherlands.
