The workers checked the ingate before pouring the metal. = 工人们在浇注金属之前检查了浇口。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Molten metal was flowing through the ingate when the accident happened. = 事故发生时，熔融金属正流过浇口。
They were examining the ingate for blockages. = 他们正在检查浇口是否有堵塞。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The metal had solidified before they realized the ingate was blocked. = 在他们意识到浇口堵塞之前，金属已经凝固了。
They had inspected the ingate thoroughly before starting the process. = 在开始这个过程之前，他们已经彻底检查了浇口。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
They had been monitoring the ingate temperature throughout the process. = 他们在整个过程中一直在监测浇口的温度。
The foundry had been using that ingate design for several years before switching to a new one. = 该铸造厂在改用新设计之前已经使用该浇口设计好几年了。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
We will inspect the ingate before the next casting. = 我们将在下次铸造前检查浇口。
The new ingate design will improve the flow rate. = 新的浇口设计将提高流速。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The engineers will be testing the new ingate design tomorrow. = 工程师们明天将测试新的浇口设计。
They will be monitoring the ingate temperature closely during the casting process. = 在铸造过程中，他们将密切监测浇口的温度。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the week, we will have completed the ingate design. = 到本周末，我们将完成浇口设计。
The foundry will have cast several parts using the new ingate by next month. = 到下个月，铸造厂将使用新的浇口铸造几个零件。
