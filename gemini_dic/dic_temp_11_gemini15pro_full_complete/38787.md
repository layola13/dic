conductible:/kənˈdʌktəbl/ | adj. | 可传导的 | Capable of conducting something (especially electricity, heat, or sound). |  Electricity is conductible through copper wires. 电可以通过铜线传导。|  Heat is readily conductible through metal. 热量很容易通过金属传导。 | 近义词: conductive, transmissible | 反义词: nonconductive, insulating | 词性: adjective

词源: From conduct + -ible.  "Conduct" comes from Late Latin conductus, past participle of conducere "to lead, bring together," from com- "together" (see com-) + ducere "to lead" (from PIE root *deuk- "to lead").  "-ible" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of, susceptible of, fit to be," from French -ible and directly from Latin -ibilis.
