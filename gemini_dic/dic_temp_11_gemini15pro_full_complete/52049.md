diallel:/daɪˈæliːl/
noun
双列杂交，双列杂交的
A diallel cross is a mating scheme used in genetics in which each genotype in a set is crossed with every other genotype in the set, including itself.
Diallel crosses are used to estimate the general and specific combining abilities of inbred lines.
例句：The researcher conducted a diallel cross to study the inheritance of yield traits.  研究人员进行了双列杂交以研究产量性状的遗传。

例句：The diallel experiment revealed significant differences in combining ability among the tested varieties. 双列杂交试验揭示了受试品种间组合能力的显著差异。
近义词：crossbreeding, hybridization
反义词:  N/A
