bicallous:/baɪˈkæləs/
adjective
双胼胝体的；有两个胼胝体的
having two callosities
No例句 found in general English. This is a specialized anatomical term.  (Could be used in a sentence like: "The MRI revealed a bicallous brain structure.")
近义词: No common synonyms exist.  Potentially "double-callosum" though not a standard term.
反义词: No antonyms exist. The absence of a corpus callosum is referred to as "agenesis of the corpus callosum."
词性: adjective

词源: From "bi-" (meaning two) + "callous" (referring to a hardened or thickened area, in this case the corpus callosum).  Ultimately from Latin "callum" (hard skin).
