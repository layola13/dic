注意事项:  "Infilm" is not a standard English word.  While grammatically correct in its construction, it is rarely used.  "Film" is the more common verb. This entire response is based on the hypothetical usage of "infilm" as if it were a commonly used word.  It is highly recommended to use "film" instead.
