词源:
The origin of "naff" is uncertain, but it's believed to have originated in British slang, possibly from Polari (a form of slang used in some gay subcultures) or from RAF slang (Royal Air Force). Some suggest a connection to the acronym "N.A.A.F.I." (Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes), which provided recreational facilities and goods to British armed forces personnel, and the perceived low quality of some of these goods.  However, these etymologies are not definitively proven.
