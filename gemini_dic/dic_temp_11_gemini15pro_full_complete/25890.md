词源: From burly + -ly.  "Burly" itself comes from Middle English *borlich, likely from Old English *burlic, related to Old Norse *bjartr, meaning "bright, shining," and later developing the sense of "strong, stout." The shift in meaning from "bright" to "strong" may be due to an association with large, powerful figures.
