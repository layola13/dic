Etymology:
From Middle English *drien*, from Old English *drīgan* (“to dry, become dry”), from Proto-Germanic *drūgijaną* (“to dry”), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰrewgʰ- (“dry”). Cognate with West Frisian *drage* (“to dry”), Dutch *dragen* (“to bear, carry, wear, endure, suffer, tolerate”), German *tragen* (“to carry, wear”), Danish *drægge* (“to drag”).  The meaning shifted in West Germanic from "become dry" to "carry" in some languages.
