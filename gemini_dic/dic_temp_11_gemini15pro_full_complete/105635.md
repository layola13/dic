词源:  "King hit" originated in Australian English. "King" is used as an intensifier, similar to "dead" in "dead tired".  The precise origin is uncertain, but it gained popularity in the mid-20th century.  Due to its negative connotations, some media outlets now avoid the term, preferring "coward punch."
