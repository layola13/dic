ETYMOLOGY->

From Old English *cumb, from Proto-Germanic *kumbaz "valley, bowl," from Proto-Indo-European *kumbos "bowl, container."  Related to Old High German kumpf "bowl," Latin cumba "boat, skiff."  The sense of "rooster's comb" is likely a metaphorical extension, referring to the comb's resemblance to a valley or ridge.
