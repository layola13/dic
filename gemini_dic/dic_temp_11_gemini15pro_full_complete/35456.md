coacervates:/koʊˈæsərveɪts/| n. |凝聚层;团聚体|A collection of colloidal droplets held together by electrostatic forces, typically formed by the mixing of two oppositely charged polymers in water.  They are thought to have played a role in the origin of life. |Coacervates can selectively absorb and concentrate certain molecules from the surrounding environment.|Synonyms:  aggregates, clusters, globules|Antonyms: solutions, dispersions|Noun

coacervate:/koʊˈæsərveɪt/| v. |凝聚; (使)成凝聚层|To form or cause to form into coacervates. |The proteins coacervated in the solution.|Synonyms: aggregate, cluster, coalesce|Antonyms: disperse, dissolve|Verb
