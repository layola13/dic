ETYMOLOGY->
From "bully" (meaning a person who uses strength or power to intimidate others) + "boy" (a male child or youth).  The term "bully" itself has a complex history, possibly originating from the Dutch word "boel" meaning "lover," which later evolved to mean "pimp" and eventually took on its current negative connotation.
