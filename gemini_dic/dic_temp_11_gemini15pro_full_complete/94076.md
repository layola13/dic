Etymology: From French *impassibilité*, from Latin *impassibilitas*, from *impassibilis* "incapable of suffering," from *in-* "not" + *passibilis* "capable of suffering" (from *pati* "to suffer").  The English suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "impassive" into the noun "impassiveness."  The plural form "impassivenesses" is less common but grammatically correct, used when referring to multiple instances or types of impassiveness.
