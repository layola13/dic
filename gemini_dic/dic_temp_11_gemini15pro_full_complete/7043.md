anelectric: /ˌeɪnɪˈlɛktrɪk/ | adj. | 非电的；不带电的；不产生电的 | Not electric; not carrying or producing electricity. |  The handle is anelectric, so it's safe to touch. 这个把手是非电的，所以触摸是安全的。| The toy car is anelectric, it uses a spring mechanism. 这辆玩具车是非电的，它使用弹簧装置。 | 近义词: non-electric, non-electrical | 反义词: electric, electrical | 词性: 形容词

词源: "an-" (not, without) + "electric" (pertaining to electricity).  The prefix "an-" is a variant of "a-" which is used before words beginning with a vowel or "h". It denotes negation or absence.  "Electric" comes from the Latin "electricus" and ultimately from the Greek "ēlektron" (amber), as static electricity was first observed by rubbing amber.
