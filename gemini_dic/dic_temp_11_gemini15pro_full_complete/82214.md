词源：
From French *grotesque*, from Italian *grottesco* “of a cave, like a grotto”, from *grotta* “cave, grotto”, from Late Latin *grupta*, variant of Latin *crypta* “crypt”.  So called because paintings and sculptures like those discovered in the ruins of Nero's Domus Aurea (Golden House), which were thought to be caves, were of this style.
来自法语 *grotesque*，来自意大利语 *grottesco* “洞穴的，像石窟”，来自 *grotta* “洞穴，石窟”，来自晚期拉丁语 *grupta*，拉丁语 *crypta* “地下室”的变体。之所以这样称呼，是因为在尼禄的黄金宫殿遗址中发现的绘画和雕塑（被认为是洞穴）就是这种风格的。
