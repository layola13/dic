homoplasy:/ˈhɑːməˌpleɪzi/ /ˈhɒməˌpleɪzi/| n. |同塑性，非同源相似性|A character shared by a set of species but not present in their common ancestor.  A similar structure or molecular sequence that has evolved independently in two species.|Bats and birds both have wings, but this trait is a homoplasy since wings evolved independently in the two groups.|近义词：analogy, convergence|反义词：homology|词性:noun

Etymology: From Ancient Greek ὁμός (homós, “same”) + πλάσις (plásis, “molding, formation”).
