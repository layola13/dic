ETYMOLOGY->

From Old English *fæðm, from Proto-Germanic *faþmaz (meaning "embrace, outstretched arms").  The original meaning referred to the length of outstretched arms, hence its use as a unit of measurement.  The metaphorical sense of "understanding" developed from the idea of "getting to the bottom of" something.
