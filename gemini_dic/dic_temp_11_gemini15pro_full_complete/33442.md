ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ċyernan, from Proto-Germanic *kirnōną (“to churn”). Cognate with Old Norse kirna (“churn”), German kirnen (“to churn”), Dutch kernen (“to churn, to pit”), West Frisian kerne (“to churn”).  The sense of "to agitate violently" is derived from the original meaning of stirring milk or cream in a churn.  The figurative sense of "to produce in large quantities" is a more recent development.
