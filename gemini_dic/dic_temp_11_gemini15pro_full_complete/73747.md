词源：From Anglo-French *forleter, forlester “to abandon, neglect, give up,” from for- “away, out” + leissier, laissier “to leave.”


注意事项:  “Forlet” is a relatively uncommon word in modern English, and its usage is mainly confined to legal or formal contexts, particularly relating to property or leases.  While it shares similarities with "abandon" or "relinquish," "forlet" often implies a formal legal act of giving something up.
