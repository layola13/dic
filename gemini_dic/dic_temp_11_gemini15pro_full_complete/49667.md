Etymology:  From Old French *demisse “death, decease” (itself from Latin dēmissus, past participle of dēmittere “to send down, lay down, lower, let down, transmit, yield”), from de- “down” + mittere “to send, let go”.  The legal sense of transfer of property likely developed from the transfer of property upon death.
