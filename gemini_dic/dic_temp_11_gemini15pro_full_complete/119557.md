microstylous: /ˈmaɪkrəʊˌstaɪləs/ | adj. | 短花柱的 | Having a short style, especially one that does not extend beyond the anthers.  This condition often leads to self-pollination. | Example 1: The microstylous flowers of this primrose species are adapted for self-fertilization.  这种报春花品种的短花柱花朵适合自花授粉。

Example 2:  Researchers are studying the genetic mechanisms that determine whether a plant will be microstylous or longistylous.  研究人员正在研究决定植物是短花柱还是长花柱的遗传机制。| 近义词:  brevistylous | 反义词: longistylous, macrostylous | 词性: 形容词
