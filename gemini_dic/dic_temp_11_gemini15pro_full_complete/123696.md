词源:  "Moonblink" is a relatively recent word, likely coined poetically by combining "moon" and "blink".  It lacks a documented etymology in major dictionaries, suggesting it's a descriptive neologism.  Its meaning is derived from the visual similarity between the brief appearance of the moon through clouds and a blink of an eye.
