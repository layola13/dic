over-willingness's:/ˌoʊvərˈwɪlɪŋnəsɪz/| n.| 过分的殷勤，过度的热情|  The over-willingness's of the salesperson made the customer uncomfortable.  这个销售员过分的殷勤让顾客感到不舒服。| English Explanation:  The noun form of "over-willing," indicating an excessive eagerness or readiness to do something, often to the point of being intrusive or unwelcome.  It's formed by adding the suffix "-ness" to "over-willing" and then the possessive apostrophe and "s" to indicate possession, although this possessive form is uncommon and often unnecessary.  It's more natural to phrase it as "the over-willingness of someone" or "someone's over-willingness." | Example: His over-willingness's to please his boss was obvious to everyone. 他讨好老板的过分殷勤大家都看得出来。| Synonyms:  excessive eagerness, over-zealousness, officiousness | Antonyms: reluctance, hesitance, unwillingness, apathy | noun
