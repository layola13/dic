PHRASE->

(This word is rarely used in phrases. It is more commonly used in formal contexts to describe repeated negligence.)


词源:  "Over-" (excessive) + "remissness" (negligence, from Latin "remissus," past participle of "remittere" - to slacken, let go).  The plural form indicates multiple instances of this negligence.
