emplecton:/ɛmˈplɛktən/ | n. | 嵌入; 编织; 交织; |An emplecton is something interwoven or embedded, often referring to a structural component within a larger whole, particularly in biological or geological contexts. |The gold threads formed a beautiful emplecton within the fabric of the tapestry.| 近义词: interweaving, embedding, inclusion, incorporation | 反义词: separation, detachment, removal | 词性: noun

词源:  From the Greek word "em-plektos," meaning "woven in" or "intertwined." "Em-" is a prefix meaning "in" or "into," and "plektos" is the past participle of "plekein," meaning "to weave" or "to plait."
