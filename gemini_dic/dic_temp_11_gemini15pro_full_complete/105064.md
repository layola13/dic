ETYMOLOGY->
"kerb" comes from the Old North French "curb," meaning a rounded border.  "Crawling" comes from the Old Norse "krafla," meaning to scratch or claw, evolving to mean moving slowly.  The combined term "kerb-crawling" emerged in the 20th century to describe the specific act of slowly driving to solicit prostitutes.
