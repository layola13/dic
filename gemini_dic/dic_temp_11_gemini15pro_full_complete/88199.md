The word "himpne" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  However, if you meant "hymn," here's the analysis:

hymn: /hɪm/ | n. |赞美诗，圣歌|A religious song or poem of praise to God or a god.|例句：The congregation sang a beautiful hymn.  会众唱了一首优美的赞美诗。|例句：Her favorite hymn is "Amazing Grace." 她最喜欢的赞美诗是《奇异恩典》。|近义词：anthem, carol, psalm|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "blasphemy" in a very loose sense) |词性: Noun
