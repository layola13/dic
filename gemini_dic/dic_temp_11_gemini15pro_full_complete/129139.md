注意事项:
词源:  "no-brainer" is American slang that emerged in the mid-20th century, specifically the 1950s or 1960s.  While its precise origin is unclear, it's thought to have originated in sports, particularly American football, where a "brainer" was a play or decision requiring thought, so a "no-brainer" was one that didn't.
