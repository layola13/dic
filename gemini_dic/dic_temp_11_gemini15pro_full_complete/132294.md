词源:
Nondeference comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "deference" (meaning "respectful submission or yielding to another's opinion or will").  "Deference" itself comes from the Old French "deferer" and ultimately from the Latin "deferre" meaning "to carry down, bring, offer, submit."  Therefore, "nondeference" literally means "not submitting respectfully."
