词源:  "Overbump" is a relatively recent formation, likely arising in the late 20th or early 21st century. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") with the verb "bump" (meaning "to strike or collide with").  It's a descriptive compound word.  There's no documented historical etymology, as it's not a formally recognized word in most dictionaries yet.

用法说明:  "Overbump" is an informal and less common word. It is used to describe a bump that is more forceful or pronounced than usual. It often carries a connotation of something being slightly damaged or disturbed due to the bump.
