galvanotropism: /ˌɡælvənəˈtrəʊpɪzəm/ | n. | 向电性，趋电性 | The directional growth or movement of a living organism in response to an electrical current. |  Example: The roots of some plants exhibit galvanotropism, growing towards a positive electrode.  某些植物的根表现出向电性，朝着正极生长。

Example:  Researchers are studying galvanotropism in nerve cells to better understand nerve regeneration. 研究人员正在研究神经细胞的向电性，以更好地了解神经再生。 | 近义词: electrotropism | 反义词:  None | 词性: noun


Etymology: From *galvano-* (relating to electric currents, after Luigi Galvani) + *-tropism* (a turning or movement in response to a stimulus).
