词源:  This idiom originated in the American West, likely in the late 19th century.  "Dead" in this context means absolutely, completely, or without doubt.  "Rights" refers to having someone exactly where they should be to prove their guilt.  Imagine a gunfighter caught with a smoking gun over a victim – they'd be "dead to rights."
