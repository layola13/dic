词源: From the verb "chisel," meaning to cut or shape with a chisel, which in turn comes from the Old French "cisel," meaning "cutting tool."  The figurative sense of "chiseler" as someone who cheats or defrauds developed later, based on the idea of chipping away at something bit by bit, often dishonestly.
