注意事项:

Since "halp" is a deliberate misspelling, it doesn't have a standard phonetic transcription in dictionaries.  The provided /hælp/ is a phonetic approximation based on how it's typically pronounced.


While grammatically correct sentences can be constructed using "halp," its informal and humorous nature makes it unsuitable for formal contexts.  Its primary usage is in online communication and casual conversations.
