hyperconjugated:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɒndʒʊɡeɪtɪd/| adj.|超共轭的|An interaction between the electrons in a sigma bond (typically C-H or C-C) with an adjacent empty or partially filled p-orbital or a pi-orbital, resulting in an extended molecular orbital that increases stability.  It's a stabilizing interaction that results from the interaction of the electrons in a σ-bond (usually C-H or C-C) with an adjacent empty or partially filled p-orbital or π-orbital to give an extended molecular orbital that increases the stability of the system.|The stability of the carbocation is explained by hyperconjugation.|近义词:resonance stabilized|反义词:non-hyperconjugated|词性:adjective
