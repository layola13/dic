| adv. | 非取代地 | In a way that does not involve substitution; without substitution.  The process occurs nonsubstitutionally, meaning the original component remains in place. | The atoms are incorporated nonsubstitutionally into the crystal lattice.  原子非取代地结合到晶格中。| nonsubstitutively is not commonly used enough to have clear synonyms or antonyms,  related terms might include "directly," "integrally," or "intrinsically" for synonyms, and "replaceably" or "substitutionally" for antonyms. | adverb
