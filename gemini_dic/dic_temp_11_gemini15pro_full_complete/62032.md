词源: e- (electronic) + navigate.  "Enavigate" is a relatively modern term that emerged with the rise of the internet and digital technology. It combines the prefix "e-" (short for "electronic") with the verb "navigate" to specifically refer to browsing or finding one's way through electronic environments, such as websites, online databases, or software interfaces.  While "navigate" itself has a long history, derived from Latin "navigare" (to sail a ship), "enavigate" is a more recent adaptation reflecting the digital age.
