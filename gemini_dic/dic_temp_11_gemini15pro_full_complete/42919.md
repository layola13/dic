covalents:/koʊˈveɪlənts/| n.| 共价键 |A chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.|Water molecules are held together by covalent bonds.|近义词:molecular bond|反义词:ionic bond|词性:名词
