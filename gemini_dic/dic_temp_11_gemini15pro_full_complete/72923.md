Etymology:
From Middle English *fond, from Old English *gefondian (“to try, test, tempt”), from Proto-Germanic *fandijaną (“to try, tempt”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰendʰ- (“to bind, tie; string; band”).  The sense evolution from "foolish" to "affectionate" likely arose through the notion of doting or being foolishly attached to someone.
