desalination:/diːˌsælɪˈneɪʃən/ |n.|脱盐，海水淡化|The desalination of seawater is an important process for providing fresh water in arid regions. 海水的淡化是在干旱地区提供淡水的重要的过程。|Desalination plants are becoming increasingly common in areas with limited freshwater resources.  海水淡化厂在淡水资源有限的地区正变得越来越普遍。|近义词:desalting|反义词:salination|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From de- (prefix meaning "removal or reversal") + saline (salty) + -ation (suffix forming nouns of action or process).  Ultimately from Latin sal (salt). 来自de-（前缀，意为“去除或逆转”）+ saline（含盐的）+ -ation（构成动作或过程名词的后缀）。最终来自拉丁语sal（盐）。
