词源:  "out-by" is a compound word formed from the adverb "out" and the preposition/adverb "by."  "Out" indicates a position away from a center or inside, while "by" can suggest proximity or location near something.  Together, they convey the sense of a place situated outside and near a main town or city.  It likely emerged in English during the late 19th or early 20th century as suburban development increased.
