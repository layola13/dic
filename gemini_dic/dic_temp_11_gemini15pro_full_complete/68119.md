Etymology: From *faggot* (a derogatory term for a gay man) + *-ish* (suffix forming adjectives).  The word's origins are complex and ultimately uncertain, but "faggot" may derive from Middle English *fagot*, meaning "bundle of sticks," which was later used to refer to elderly women and then, derogatorily, to gay men.
