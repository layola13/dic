ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "pie" meaning "magpie" (originally a nickname for Margaret, due to its chattering call resembling the sound of the name) and "maga" meaning "chattering".  "Maga" comes from a Germanic source related to "mag" meaning "stomach" or "craw," referring to the bird's habit of filling its crop with food.
