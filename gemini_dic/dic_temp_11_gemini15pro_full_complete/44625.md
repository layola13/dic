词源:
From "crow" (v.) + "-er" (suffix forming nouns denoting agents).  "Crow" (v.) comes from Old English "crāwan," imitative of the bird's cry.

用法说明:

"Crowers" is the plural form of "crower," which itself is derived from the verb "to crow."  While "crows" is the standard plural of the noun "crow" (referring to the bird), "crowers" specifically emphasizes the act of crowing (making the characteristic loud cry). It is less commonly used than "crows."
