##parameter /ˈpəˈræmɪtər/ | n. |参数，参量 | 参数；决定因素；变量 |  The key parametersof the experiment were temperature and pressure.  实验的关键参数是温度和压力。 |  variable, factor, argument |  (无明显的反义词，可根据语境选择如：constant, fixed value) | 名词παράμετρος ( *parámetros*).  *Para-* is a preposition meaning "beside," "alongside," or "beyond," and *metron* means "measure."  Therefore, a parameter literallymeant something measured alongside or in relation to something else.  Its mathematical usage evolved from this geometric sense, referring to a constant value in an equation or a variable that is held constant in a particular experiment or model.  The word'sadoption into English came through French.* **In mathematics:**  A parameter is a variable upon which other variables depend. It is often used in equations to represent a quantity that can vary., describe the characteristics of a sample drawn from that population.that influences or limits a process or system.  However, in this more general usage,  words like "factor," "variable," or "setting" might be more appropriate.2.  The success of the project depends on various parameters, such as funding and manpower.  项目的成功取决于各种参数，例如资金和人力。We need to adjust the parameters to optimize the system's performance. 我们需要调整参数以优化系统的性能。关联:*** **Present Tense:** "The *parameters* **are** currently being tested." (参数目前正在测试中)optimized next month." (参数将在下个月进行优化)
