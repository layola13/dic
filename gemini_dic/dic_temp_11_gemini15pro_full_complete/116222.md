ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *maçonerie "masonry,"  derived from maçon "mason," from Frankish *makjo "mason," ultimately from Vulgar Latin *maccionius (source also of Italian macigno "stone, rock").  The word ultimately traces back to Latin machina "machine, engine, device, structure," possibly from Doric Greek μαχανά (makhana),  related to Greek μηχανή (mēkhanē) meaning "contrivance, means."
