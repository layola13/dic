注意事项:

This word's primary usage in English is as a transliteration from Chinese. It's not a common English word with a widely understood meaning outside of specific contexts.  Therefore, providing extensive examples can be misleading, as native English speakers would likely use different vocabulary (like "section," "paragraph," "part," etc.)  While grammatically correct within the given framework, the examples might sound unnatural in everyday English conversation.
