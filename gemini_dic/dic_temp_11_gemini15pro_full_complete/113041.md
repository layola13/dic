luminosity:/ˌluːmɪˈnɒsəti/ /ˌluːmɪˈnɑːsəti/| n.|光度，明亮，光辉|The luminosity of a star is its intrinsic brightness.  一颗恒星的光度是它的固有亮度。|例句：The luminosity of the supernova was astonishing. 超新星的光度令人震惊。|近义词：brightness, brilliance, radiance, glow|反义词：dimness, darkness|词性：名词
Etymology:  From Late Latin *lūminōsitās, from Latin lūminōsus (“bright, shining”), from lūmen (“light”). Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *leuk- (“light, brightness”).
