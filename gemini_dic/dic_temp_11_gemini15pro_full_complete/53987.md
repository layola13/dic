The word "discretive" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  The closest words are "discrete" and "discreet," which are often confused.  I will provide analyses for both.

**Discrete:**

/dɪˈskriːt/ | adj. | 离散的；分离的；不连续的 | Individually separate and distinct. | Example: The process involves a series of discrete steps.  这个过程包括一系列独立的步骤。 | Example:  Speech sounds are produced as a continuous signal but perceived as discrete units. 语音信号是作为连续信号产生的，但被感知为离散的单元。 | Synonyms: separate, distinct, individual, discontinuous | Antonyms: continuous, connected, attached | Word Type: Adjective

**Discreet:**

/dɪˈskriːt/ | adj. | 谨慎的；低调的；不引人注目的 | Careful and circumspect in one's speech or actions, especially in order to avoid causing offense or attracting attention. | Example: He was always very discreet about his love affairs. 他对自己的风流韵事总是非常谨慎。| Example:  She cast a discreet glance at the man across the table. 她谨慎地瞥了一眼桌子对面的男人。 | Synonyms: tactful, diplomatic, careful, cautious, prudent | Antonyms: indiscreet, careless, imprudent, tactless | Word Type: Adjective


**Etymology of Discrete:**

From Latin *discretus*, past participle of *discernere* "to separate, distinguish," from *dis-* "apart" + *cernere* "to sift, separate, distinguish."

**Etymology of Discreet:**

From Latin *discretus*, same root as "discrete," but the meaning evolved differently in French before being adopted into English.  The shared root reflects the idea of separating or distinguishing, in this case, between what is appropriate to say or do and what is not.
