ETYMOLOGY->
From Old Norse *flytja "to transport, convey," causative of *flýta "to hasten, flee," from Proto-Germanic *fleutanan "to float, swim, fly," from PIE root *pleu- "to flow, to swim, to fly."  The sense evolution seems to have progressed from "move quickly through air or water" to "move quickly in general," then to "move quickly and briefly from place to place."
