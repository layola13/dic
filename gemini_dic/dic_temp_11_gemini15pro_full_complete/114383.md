注意事项:

"make's" as a contraction of "make is" is relatively uncommon and can sound awkward. It's generally better to rephrase using "the make of" or a similar construction for clarity. For example, "The chair's make is..." could be better expressed as "The make of the chair is..." or "The chair's manufacturer is..."
