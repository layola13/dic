ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *delatio, from Latin delatus, past participle of deferre "to carry down, bring to," from de- "down" + ferre "to carry." The meaning shifted from "carrying information" to "informing against."  The meaning "extension" comes from the sense of "carrying out" or "prolonging."
