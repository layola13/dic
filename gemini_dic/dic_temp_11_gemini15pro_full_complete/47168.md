词源：From Old English *dagian "to become day," from Proto-Germanic *dagōjaną (source also of Old Frisian dagia, Old Saxon dagōn, Old High German tagēn, German tagen "to dawn"), from PIE root *dhegh- "to burn, shine."  The original sense was intransitive, "to grow light;" the figurative sense of "to become evident" is from mid-15c.  The transitive sense "to begin, usher in" is rare.
