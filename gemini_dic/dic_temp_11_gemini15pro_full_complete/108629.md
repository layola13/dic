N/A (leading-out is not commonly used in phrases)


词源： "leading" comes from the Old English *lædan "to lead", from Proto-Germanic *laidijan, from Proto-Indo-European *leit- "to go forth, proceed."  "Out" comes from Old English ūt, from Proto-Germanic *ut, from Proto-Indo-European *ud- “out, away, from within.”  The combination simply signifies "leading outwards."
