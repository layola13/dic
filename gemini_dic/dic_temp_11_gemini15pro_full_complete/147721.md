ETYMOLOGY->
From over + presumptuous + -ly.  "Over" intensifies the meaning of "presumptuous," which itself comes from the Latin "praesumptuosus," meaning "bold," "daring," or "audacious," ultimately derived from "praesumere" ("to anticipate" or "assume beforehand"). The suffix "-ly" turns the adjective "presumptuous" into an adverb.
