denormalization:/diːˌnɔːrmələˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |反规范化，逆规范化|The process of reversing normalization, typically in a database, to improve read performance at the expense of write performance. It involves adding redundant data or grouping data to reduce the number of joins required to retrieve information.  |Example 1: Denormalization can improve query speed, but it requires careful planning. 反规范化可以提高查询速度，但需要仔细规划。

Example 2: The team decided on denormalization to address the performance issues.  团队决定采用反规范化来解决性能问题。|Synonym: redundancy, data duplication|Antonym: normalization|noun
