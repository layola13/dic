From French *lampon*, perhaps from *lampons*, "let's drink," from *lamper*, "to guzzle," perhaps imitative of noisy drinking.  The connection may be because satirical poems were often recited at drinking parties. 源自法语 *lampon*，可能来自 *lampons*，“我们喝酒吧”，来自 *lamper*，“狂饮”，可能模仿嘈杂的饮酒声。这种联系可能是因为讽刺诗经常在酒会上朗诵。
