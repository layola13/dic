computa:/kəmˈpjuːtə/ | n. | computer; calculate | A machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.  It can also refer to the act of calculating. |  This word is a backformation from "compute," which comes from the Latin "computare," meaning "to reckon, sum up, compute," from "com-" (together) + "putare" (to prune, to think).  The original sense was "to prune, clear up trees," then "to clear up accounts," hence "to calculate."|
