hyphomycetes:/ˌhaɪfəˈmaɪsiːtiːz/ | n. |丝孢菌|A large and artificial class of fungi, part of the Deuteromycota, also called Fungi Imperfecti (because a sexual or perfect stage is unknown). Characterized by the presence of exposed conidia or clusters of conidia. Includes many plant pathogens, saprobes, and some human pathogens.|Example 1: Hyphomycetes play a crucial role in decomposition in many ecosystems. 丝孢菌在许多生态系统中扮演着分解的关键角色。

Example 2: Some species of hyphomycetes are used in the production of certain cheeses. 一些丝孢菌被用于某些奶酪的生产。|Synonym:  imperfect fungi, conidial fungi|Antonym:  N/A (since it's a taxonomic group, a direct antonym isn't applicable)|Noun
