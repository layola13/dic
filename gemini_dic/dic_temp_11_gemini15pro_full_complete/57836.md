词源:
From Old French *dresser "to arrange, straighten, prepare," from Vulgar Latin *drectāre, frequentative of Latin dīrigere "to direct, guide, arrange," from dis- "apart" + regere "to guide, rule." The sense evolution is from "to prepare (food), arrange (hair), treat (a wound)" to "clothe oneself," then to "clothe someone."
