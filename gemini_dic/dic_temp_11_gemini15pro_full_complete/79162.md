Etymology:
From Scottish *glamour*, variant of *grammar*.  Originally, in the sense of "magic, enchantment," specifically the kind believed to be cast by fairies or witches to make people see things differently than they actually are.  This sense was influenced by association with *gramarye*, "magic, learning," from Old French *gramaire*.  The more general sense of "attractive or exciting quality" developed later.
