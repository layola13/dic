词源:

"Feyest" is a superlative form of "fey," likely formed analogously to words like "fairest" or "gayest."  "Fey" itself comes from Middle English *fay,  from Old English *fæge (doomed, fated to die), ultimately from Proto-Germanic *faigjaz (doomed to die). The word is related to the Old Norse feigr (doomed to die). The meaning shifted from literally "doomed to die" to a more general sense of being under a spell or having an otherworldly air, often associated with impending doom.
