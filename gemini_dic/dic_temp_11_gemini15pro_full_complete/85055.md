ETYMOLOGY->
From "hard" + "boiled."  The literal sense referring to eggs dates back to the 17th century.  The figurative sense referring to a person's demeanor emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in American slang, likely influenced by the image of a hard-boiled egg being tough and unyielding.
