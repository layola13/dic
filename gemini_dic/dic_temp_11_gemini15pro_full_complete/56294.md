词源： "Dogging" in the sense of public sexual activity is of relatively recent origin (late 20th/early 21st century). Its etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to the verb "to dog" meaning "to follow persistently," implying that individuals involved in this activity were followed or observed. Another theory suggests it might be linked to the practice of taking dogs for walks in areas where such activities took place.
