Etymology:
From non- + conversant + -ly.  Non- is a prefix meaning "not." Conversant comes from the Old French conversant, present participle of converser "to live with, keep company with," from Latin conversari "to associate with, dwell with," frequentative of convertere "to turn around, transform."  The suffix -ly forms adverbs.
