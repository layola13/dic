词源: From Middle English *innocentest, *innocentist, from Old French innocent, from Latin innocentem (nominative innocēns), from in- (“not”) + nocentem, present participle of nocēre (“to harm”).  The "-est" ending is a superlative suffix.  While "innocentest" is attested in older texts, "most innocent" is the preferred form in modern English.
