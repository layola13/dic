ETYMOLOGY->
From henchman + -ship.  Henchman originally referred to a squire or page, a young attendant, particularly one skilled in horsemanship. Over time, the meaning shifted to a loyal and often unscrupulous follower or supporter, especially of a political leader or criminal.  The suffix "-ship" denotes the state, quality, or skill of being a henchman, thus henchmanship refers to the actions or behavior characteristic of a henchman.
