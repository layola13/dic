"Multiculturalist" is derived from "multiculturalism."  "Multi-" is a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," derived from Latin. "Cultural" relates to culture, from the Latin "cultura," meaning "cultivation" or "growing." "-ism" is a suffix indicating a doctrine, belief, or practice.  Therefore, "multiculturalism" refers to the doctrine or practice of supporting multiple cultures.  "-ist" is a suffix denoting a person who adheres to a particular doctrine or belief. Thus, "multiculturalist" signifies a person who believes in or supports multiculturalism.
