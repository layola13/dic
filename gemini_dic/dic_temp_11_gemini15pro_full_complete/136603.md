ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + sanguinely.  "Sanguine" comes from Latin "sanguis" (blood), referring to the medieval belief that the bodily humors influenced temperament. A sanguine person was thought to have a predominance of blood, making them cheerful and optimistic.  "Non-" simply negates this, creating the meaning "not sanguine" or "without optimism."
