entropies:/ˈɛntrəpiz/| n. |熵（复数）|A thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system.  Also, a measure of uncertainty or randomness in information theory.|The entropies of the systems increased after the reaction. 反应后系统的熵增加了。|Near synonyms: randomness, disorder, chaos|Near antonyms: order, organization|noun
