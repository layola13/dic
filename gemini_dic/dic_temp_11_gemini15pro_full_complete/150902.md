##parallax:/ˈpærælæks/ | n. |视差，视差法|in the position of an object when viewed from different positions.  It's a phenomenon caused by the change in the observer's point of view.The greater the distance between the observation points, the greater the parallax. This principle is used in various fields, including astronomy to measure the distances to stars and inphotography to create depth of field.  In simpler terms, it's the difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight.star.  天文学家用视差法计算了到那颗恒星的距离。使用了浅景深来创造强烈的视差效果，使背景模糊，突出主体。could consider concepts that imply lack of perspective shift, like "unchanging position" or "invariant appearance" as relative opposites.," and ἀλλάξις (allaxís), meaning "change."  This reflects the fundamental concept of parallax: the change in the apparent position of an object observed from different positions.it.  It can also be used adjectivally as in "parallax error" (视差误差) which describes an error in measurement due to parallax.  Understanding and correcting for parallax is crucial in numerous scientific disciplines and technologies.  For instance, in surveying, parallax error can significantly impact the accuracy ofmeasurements. In 3D computer graphics, parallax mapping is a technique used to create more realistic-looking surfaces by simulating the way surface details appear to shift depending on the viewing angle.
