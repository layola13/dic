molluscoidea:/ˌmɒləskɔɪˈdɪə/ | n. | 苔藓动物门（现已废弃的分类）| A historical taxonomic group that included brachiopods, bryozoans, and sometimes other invertebrate phyla, now considered invalid.  This term is no longer used in modern zoology.|  Molluscoidea was once used to group brachiopods and bryozoans. 苔藓动物门曾用于将腕足动物和苔藓虫分组。 | 近义词: (No longer relevant as a taxonomic term -  use separate phyla like Brachiopoda and Bryozoa) | 反义词:  (Not applicable) | 词性: Noun


Etymology:  From Latin "molluscus" (soft) + Greek "-eidos" (form, resemblance).  The term implied a resemblance to mollusks, which is now understood to be superficial.
