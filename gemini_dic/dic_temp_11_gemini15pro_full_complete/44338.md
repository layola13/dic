ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *crocier (Modern French croisier), from Medieval Latin crociarius "cross-bearer," from Latin crux "cross." The sense shifted from "cross-bearer" to the staff itself, which often had a curved top resembling a shepherd's crook.  The botanical sense comes from the resemblance of the young fern frond to a bishop's crosier.
