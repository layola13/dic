The word "nongayest" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  If you intended a different word, please provide it.  However, I can explain "non-" and "gayest" separately and speculate on a possible combined meaning.

**non-**
/nɒn/ (British) /nɑːn/ (American) | prefix | 非，不 |  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "absence of." | Non-alcoholic beer is a popular choice for designated drivers.  无酒精啤酒是指派司机的热门选择。|  nonessential, non-profit |  - | prefix

**gayest**
/ˈɡeɪɪst/ | adjective (superlative) | 最快乐的，最同性恋的 | Superlative form of "gay," meaning either "happy and carefree" (older usage) or "homosexual."  |  This is the gayest party I've ever been to! (meaning happiest) 这是我参加过的最快乐的派对！|  happiest, most cheerful, most joyous (for happy meaning) | saddest, most depressing (for happy meaning) | adjective

**Speculative combined meaning of "nongayest":**

If someone were to use "nongayest," it would likely mean "least gay," which could have two interpretations depending on the intended meaning of "gay":

1. **Least happy:**  This would describe something or someone extremely unhappy, depressed, or gloomy.
2. **Least homosexual:** This would describe something or someone that is not at all associated with homosexuality.  This usage could be problematic, as it reinforces a binary view of sexuality and could be interpreted as homophobic.

Since "nongayest" is not a standard word, I cannot provide examples of its use in different tenses or phrases.  It's generally best to avoid using non-standard words like this, as they can be confusing and may not be understood.
