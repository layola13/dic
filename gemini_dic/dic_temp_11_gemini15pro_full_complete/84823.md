注意事项:

"hang's" is informal and primarily used in spoken English.  While it can technically be possessive, it's more often used to describe the knack or skill of something.  It's less common in written English. Its etymology is uncertain, but it likely relates to the verb "hang" in the sense of "understanding how something works or fits together."
