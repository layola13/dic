词性: adjective
词源:  "far-stretched" is a compound adjective formed from the adverb "far" and the past participle of the verb "stretch." "Far" has its origins in Old English "feorr," related to the Dutch "ver" and German "fern." "Stretch" comes from Old English "streccan," related to Old High German "strecken." The combination of these words creates the meaning of something extended beyond reasonable or believable limits.
