Etymology:
blood (n.) Old English blod "blood, bloodshed," from Proto-Germanic *blodam (source also of Old Saxon blod, Old Frisian blod, Middle Dutch bloet, Dutch bloed, Old High German bluot, German Blut, Old Norse bloð), from PIE root *bhlo- "to blossom, sprout, bloom" (source also of Latin flos "flower," florere "to blossom, bloom, flourish").  The notion is perhaps of the "life fluid" that appears on the surface of a wound.

thirsty (adj.) Old English þyrstig "thirsty, dry, parched," from þurst (see thirst (n.)). Figurative sense of "eagerly desirous" is from c. 1300. The -y suffix is adjectival, from Proto-Germanic *-igaz.

-est (suffix) Old English -est, superlative suffix used with adjectives and adverbs.
