ETYMOLOGY->
From anti- + Bolshevik.  "Bolshevik" comes from Russian Большевик (Bolʹševik), meaning "member of the majority", derived from большинство (bolʹšinstvo, “majority”).  It referred to the majority faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, which seized power in the October Revolution of 1917.  "Anti-" is a prefix of Greek origin meaning "against," "opposite of," "instead of," or "equivalent to."
