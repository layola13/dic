Etymology: From Swahili *mtumbwi *(dugout canoe), from Arabic *tumb*, a variant of *ṭūf*, from Aramaic *ṭūfā* (raft, float).  The Arabic term likely referred to sewn plank boats, rather than dugouts, and the Swahili term was transferred to these vessels. The English word "dhow" is likely derived from the Swahili term.
