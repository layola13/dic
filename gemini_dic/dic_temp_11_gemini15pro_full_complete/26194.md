butsus: /ˈbʌtsʊs/ | n. | 猪; 野猪 |  A pig, especially a wild one. While not a standard English word, it seems to be a variation or misspelling of "butcher's"  pig referring to a pig intended for slaughter, or possibly a dialectical or archaic term related to "boar". It could also be a misspelling of "Sus," the scientific genus name for pigs. | Example: The farmer brought the butsus to market. 农民把猪带到市场. | Synonym: pig, hog, boar, swine | Antonym:  N/A (Animals don't typically have direct antonyms) | Noun
