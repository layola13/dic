logarithmically:/ˌlɒɡərɪðmɪk(ə)li/ | adv. | 对数地 | In a manner related to or expressed in terms of logarithms. | The data increased logarithmically. 数据呈对数增长。|  Near logarithmically: The program scales near logarithmically with the input size.  该程序随输入大小近似对数缩放。 | 近义词: exponentially (反义词，表示增长速度更快) | 反义词: linearly (反义词，表示增长速度更慢) | 词性: 副词

Etymology: From logarithm + -ic + -ally.  Logarithm comes from Greek logos "reckoning, ratio" + arithmos "number."
