"chenung" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, if it's a name, a technical term, or from a specific cultural context, knowing this would help in finding its meaning.

However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage with the word "what," I can provide that information.  Please note that because "chenung" isn't a recognized word, I cannot use it in the examples.
