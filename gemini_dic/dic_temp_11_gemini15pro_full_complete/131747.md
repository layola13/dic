ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + conformity.  "Conformity" comes from the Late Latin "conformitās," meaning "similarity, resemblance."  "Con-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "with," and "formitās" relates to "forma," meaning "form" or "shape."  Therefore, "nonconformity" literally means "not having the same form or shape," extending to behavior and beliefs.
