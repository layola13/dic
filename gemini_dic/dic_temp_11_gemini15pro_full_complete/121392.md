ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (prefix meaning 'wrongly' or 'badly') + hit.  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrong," "bad," "amiss,"  from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*mei- (1)" meaning "to change, go, move." "Hit" comes from Old English "hittan," meaning "to come upon, meet with, encounter," also "to strike, hit," from Proto-Germanic "*hittijanan," of uncertain origin.
