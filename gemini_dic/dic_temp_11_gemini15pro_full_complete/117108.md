词源：From Old English *mǣl (plural *mǣlu), from Proto-Germanic *matiz (compare Old Frisian mel, Old Saxon, Old High German, Gothic matils "meal, food, time"), from Proto-Indo-European *mad- "moist, wet" (source also of Sanskrit medas- "fat," Greek mastos "breast," Old Church Slavonic moditi "to urinate," Lithuanian mėdis "tree"). The sense development is from "soft food" to "food" in general, then to "a regular occasion of eating."
