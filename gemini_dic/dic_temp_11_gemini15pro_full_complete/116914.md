PHRASE-> (These phrases don't naturally incorporate "mayoralties")

PHRASE-> (Again, "mayoralties" is awkward in phrases.  Focusing on "mayor" or "mayorship" is more natural)


词源：
From "mayor" + "-alty," a suffix forming nouns denoting status or jurisdiction.  "Mayor" ultimately comes from Latin "major," meaning "greater."
