ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *averie (noun), and *averer (verb), meaning "goods damaged at sea," and "to declare the amount of damage," respectively.  These derived from Italian avaria, "damage to ship or cargo," ultimately from Arabic 'awārīya, meaning "damaged goods."  The meaning shifted from referring to financial loss to a general numerical mean.
