词源:
From Old French *dirige (recorded only in dirigement "funeral service"), from Latin dirige, imperative singular of dirigere "to direct, guide," from dis- "apart" + regere "to guide, rule." Originally, the word referred to a specific liturgical prayer, "Dirige, Domine Deus," meaning "Direct, O Lord God," which was part of the Office of the Dead in the Roman Catholic Church.  Over time, the term came to refer to any mournful song or piece of music associated with funerals and mourning.
