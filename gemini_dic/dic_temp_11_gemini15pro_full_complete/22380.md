词源：Boody is a relatively recent term, likely a portmanteau of "body" and "moody," suggesting underwear that reflects one's mood or style, emphasizing comfort and self-expression.  It's often used by brands focusing on sustainable and ethical production of undergarments. While a precise etymological record is difficult to pinpoint, its usage surged with the rise of online retail and direct-to-consumer brands in the fashion industry.
