```n. |副突, 侧突 |Parapophysis refers to asmall, transverse process on the vertebrae of certain animals, particularly reptiles and amphibians. It provides attachment points for muscles and ligaments.  It's distinct from othervertebral processes like the prezygapophysis and postzygapophysis which are involved in articulation with adjacent vertebrae.|Example: The parapophysis of thesnake's vertebrae played a crucial role in its locomotion.|近义词: transverse process (更通用的术语) |反义词:  无直接反义词，但可以与其他椎骨突起（例如棘突）进行对比。|名词side."The term "parapophysis" is primarily used in zoology and comparative anatomy, specifically when describing the skeletal structure of vertebrates, particularly those with less specialized vertebral columns like reptiles and amphibians.  It's less frequently used in the context of mammalian anatomy because mammalian vertebrae generally don't have a distinct parapophysisas prominently defined as in some reptiles and amphibians.projections (like pre and postzygapophyses, and diapophysis) is crucial for accurate interpretation.  The description often includes details about its size, shape, and its role in muscle attachment or ligament connection.physis morphology in various species of extinct dinosaurs, revealing insights into their locomotion patterns."
