Etymology:
From Late Latin *incertitudo, from Latin incertus (“uncertain”) + -tudo (“-tude”).  The suffix "-tude" forms abstract nouns from adjectives, meaning the state or quality of being. The root "incertus" is formed from "in-" (not) + "certus" (certain).  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱer- (“to distinguish, separate”).
