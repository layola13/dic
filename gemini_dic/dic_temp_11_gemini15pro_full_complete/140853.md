词源: The origin of "on the fritz" is uncertain, but it's believed to be related to the German word "Fritz," a common nickname for Friedrich, which was sometimes used as a generic term for a German soldier during World War I.  One theory suggests it referred to German sabotage, while another proposes it originated from the name of a repairman.  Regardless of its precise origin, the term gained popularity in American English in the early 20th century.
