注意事项:
The term "Aryan" is highly sensitive and loaded with historical baggage, particularly due to its association with Nazi ideology.  Use with extreme caution and be mindful of its complex and often misused history.  When discussing the term, it's often necessary to clarify the specific meaning being used (linguistic, historical, or the distorted Nazi interpretation).
