ETYMOLOGY->
From humorous + -ness + -'s (possessive).  Humorous traces back to the Late Latin word "humorosus," meaning "full of humor," from "humor" (moisture, fluid).  The sense of "humor" referring to temperament or disposition developed from the ancient belief that the body's fluids influenced one's character.  The modern sense of "humor" as something amusing developed later.
