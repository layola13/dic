backstress: /ˈbækˌstres/ | n. | 背应力，回弹应力 | In materials science, backstress represents the internal stress that opposes the applied stress and contributes to the material's resistance to deformation, particularly during cyclic loading. It is often associated with the Bauschinger effect.  | The backstress developed during the cyclic loading prevented further yielding of the material.  在循环加载过程中产生的背应力阻止了材料的进一步屈服。| The researchers analyzed the evolution of backstress in the metal alloy. 研究人员分析了金属合金中背应力的演变。 | synonyms: residual stress, internal stress | antonyms: applied stress | noun
