##paragonite 的详细解析ənaɪt/ | n. | 锂云母 |****英文解析:** Paragonite is a mineral belonging to the mica group.  It's a hydrous sodium aluminium phyllosilicate, meaning its chemicalstructure consists of layers of silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and water molecules.  Unlike muscovite (another common mica), paragonite contains sodium instead ofpotassium. Its color is typically white to grayish-white, but can also exhibit other light shades depending on impurities.  It's often found in metamorphic rocks, particularly those formed under high-pressure conditions like schist and gneiss.  Paragonite can also be found in some pegmatites. Its crystalline structure is responsible for its perfect basal cleavage, meaning it breaks easily into thin sheets. This property makes it useful in some niche applications, although it's not as widelyused as other micas.表明岩石形成过程中存在高压变质环境。a specific mineral.  An antonym would need to describe a mineral category opposing its properties. One might hypothetically consider a mineral with contrasting chemical composition and cleavage properties, but this is not a standardized antonym.)term meaning "a model of excellence or perfection," perhaps reflecting its perfect cleavage or crystalline structure when first discovered.  However, specifics regarding the etymological naming are limited in readily available research.  Further research into historical mineralogical literature might reveal a more precise etymology.式:** NaAlSi₃O₈(OH)₂its chemical composition, geological context, physical properties, and etymology.
