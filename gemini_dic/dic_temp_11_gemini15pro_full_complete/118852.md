ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin metaphysica, neuter plural of metaphysicus (“metaphysical”), from Greek τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά (tà metà tà physiká, “the things after the physics”), referring to the position of Aristotle's work on the subject in his collected works.  Originally, the term simply referred to the arrangement of Aristotle's writings by his editors, not to the content itself.
