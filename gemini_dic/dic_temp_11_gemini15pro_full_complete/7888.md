anteed: This is not a valid English word. It appears to be a fragment, possibly from a word like "guaranteed."

guaranteed: /ˌɡærənˈtiːd/ | adj. | 有保证的；一定的 | Certain to happen; assured |  例句：He's guaranteed to win the election. 他肯定会赢得选举。| 例句：A guaranteed income provides financial security. 有保障的收入提供了经济保障。 | 近义词：assured, certain, definite | 反义词：uncertain, doubtful, improbable | 词性: 形容词
