catastrophism: /kəˈtæstrəˌfɪzəm/ | n. | 灾变说，灾变论 | The theory that the Earth has been affected in the past by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.  This is in contrast to uniformitarianism, in which slow incremental changes, such as erosion, created all the Earth's geological features. |  Many geologists used to believe in catastrophism, but now most support uniformitarianism. 许多地质学家过去相信灾变说，但现在大多数人支持均变论。| synonym: cataclysm, disaster, catastrophe | antonym: uniformitarianism, gradualism | noun

Etymology:  From French *catastrophisme*, from Ancient Greek *καταστροφή (katastrophḗ)* meaning "overturn, overthrow, destruction, ruin."
