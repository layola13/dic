词源: From Middle English *mullen, from Anglo-Norman mullir, moiller (“to soften, moisten, soak”), from Latin mollire (“to soften”), from mollis (“soft”).  Originally meant to soften, sweeten, and spice wine.  The sense of "ponder" developed later, perhaps from the image of stirring thoughts around in one's mind like stirring ingredients in a drink.
