alliterator:/ɔːlˈɪtəreɪtər/ | n. | 全迭代器 | An alliterator is a hypothetical construct or function that iterates through all possible values or elements within a given domain or set. It's not a standard English word, and is likely coined in a specific technical context. |  There isn't a commonly used example sentence for "alliterator" because it's not a standard word.  A contrived example could be: "The alliterator cycled through all possible combinations of the variables." | 近义词: iterator, enumerator | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The program uses an iterator to process the data. = 程序使用迭代器来处理数据。
The iterator fetches the next element in the sequence. = 迭代器获取序列中的下一个元素。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The system is currently iterating through the list. = 系统当前正在迭代列表。
The function is iterating over the array elements. = 函数正在迭代数组元素。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The loop has iterated over all the items in the collection. = 循环已经迭代了集合中的所有项目。
The program has finished iterating through the data set. = 程序已经完成了对数据集的迭代。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The algorithm has been iterating through the matrix for hours.  = 该算法已经对矩阵迭代了几个小时。
The process has been iterating over the data since yesterday. = 该过程自昨天以来一直在迭代数据。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The function iterated over the array and returned the result. = 函数迭代数组并返回结果。
The script iterated through the file line by line. = 脚本逐行迭代文件。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was iterating through the database when the error occurred. = 程序正在迭代数据库时发生错误。
The system was iterating over the elements when it crashed. = 系统在迭代元素时崩溃了。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The loop had iterated through all the numbers before it terminated. = 循环在终止之前已经迭代了所有数字。
The function had iterated over the entire data set before returning the result. = 函数在返回结果之前已迭代了整个数据集。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been iterating through the log files for days before the issue was discovered. = 系统在发现问题之前已经迭代日志文件好几天了。
The program had been iterating over the data for hours before it finally completed. = 程序在最终完成之前已经迭代数据好几个小时了。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The algorithm will iterate through the graph to find the shortest path. = 算法将遍历图以找到最短路径。
The program will iterate over the data and calculate the average. = 程序将迭代数据并计算平均值。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be iterating through the logs tomorrow morning. = 系统明天早上将迭代日志。
The program will be iterating over the data during the off-peak hours. = 程序将在非高峰时段迭代数据。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By next week, the script will have iterated through all the customer records. = 到下周，脚本将遍历所有客户记录。
By the end of the month, the program will have iterated over the entire database. = 到月底，程序将遍历整个数据库。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the time the project is finished, the algorithm will have been iterating through the data for months. = 到项目完成时，算法将已经迭代数据数月。
By next year, the system will have been iterating over the logs for a full year. = 到明年，系统将已经迭代日志整整一年。

虚拟语气:
If we had an alliterator, we could easily test all possibilities. = 如果我们有一个全迭代器，我们就可以轻松测试所有可能性。
I wish there were an alliterator for this problem. = 我希望这个问题有一个全迭代器。

被动语态:
The data is iterated over by the function. = 数据由函数迭代。
The array was iterated through by the loop. = 数组由循环迭代。

疑问句:
How does the iterator access the next element? = 迭代器如何访问下一个元素？
What is the purpose of using an iterator? = 使用迭代器的目的是什么？

否定句:
The function does not iterate over the entire list. = 函数不会迭代整个列表。
The loop did not iterate through all the items. = 循环没有迭代所有项目。


PHRASE->
iterate over = 迭代...
iterate through = 遍历...
iterate on =  改进,反复迭代
iterate until = 迭代直到...
iterate recursively = 递归迭代


注意事项:
Since "alliterator" isn't a standard English word, its usage and associated phrases are hypothetical and based on the presumed meaning derived from "all" and "iterator."  It's crucial to consider the specific context in which this term is encountered to fully understand its intended meaning.
