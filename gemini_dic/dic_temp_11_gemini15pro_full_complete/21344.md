bloomingness's:/ˈbluːmɪŋnɪsɪz/ |n.|盛开的状态，繁荣的状态|The bloomingness's of the garden was breathtaking. 花园的繁荣景象令人叹为观止。| English Explanation:  "Bloomingness" is a noun derived from the adjective "blooming," which means flourishing or thriving.  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being blooming.  The apostrophe and "s" indicate possession. So "bloomingness's" means "the state of being blooming belonging to something/someone." While grammatically correct, it's a rather unusual and somewhat awkward construction.  A more natural phrasing might be "the bloomingness of the garden" or "the garden's blooming state." |例句：The rose's bloomingness's peak is in June. 这朵玫瑰盛开的高峰期在六月。|近义词：flourishing, thriving, prosperity|反义词：decline, decay, withering|词性: noun
