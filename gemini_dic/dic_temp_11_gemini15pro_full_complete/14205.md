autocatalysis:/ˌɔːtəʊkəˈtælɪsɪs/ | n. | 自催化 | The process by which a reaction product acts as a catalyst, accelerating the reaction.  A reaction is autocatalytic if a product of the reaction is also a catalyst for the reaction. |  Example 1: The oxidation of oxalic acid by permanganate is an example of autocatalysis. 草酸被高锰酸盐氧化是自催化的一个例子。

Example 2: Autocatalysis plays a crucial role in the origin of life theories. 自催化在生命起源理论中起着至关重要的作用。| synonym: autocatalytic reaction, self-catalysis | antonym: N/A (Autocatalysis describes a specific type of reaction; it doesn't have a direct opposite.) | noun
