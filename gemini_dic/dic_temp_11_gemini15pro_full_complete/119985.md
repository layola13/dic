milliampere: /ˈmɪliˌæmpɛər/ | n. |毫安|A unit of electric current equal to one thousandth of an ampere. |The battery supplies a current of 500 milliamperes. 电池提供500毫安的电流。|Synonyms: mA |Antonyms: (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement, but could consider kiloampere (kA) as a much larger unit) |noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From milli- + ampere.  "milli-" comes from the Latin "mille" meaning "thousand". "Ampere" is named after André-Marie Ampère, a French physicist.
