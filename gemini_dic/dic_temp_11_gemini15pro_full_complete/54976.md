Etymology:
From dis- + proportionate + -ly.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of." "Proportionate" comes from the Latin "proportionatus," past participle of "proporționare," meaning "to proportion," from "pro" (for, in favor of) + "portio" (portion, share).  "-ly" is a suffix used to form adverbs.
