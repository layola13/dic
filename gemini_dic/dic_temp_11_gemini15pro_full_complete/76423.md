注意事项:
The word "gaier" is becoming less common in modern English.  While grammatically correct, "happier," "merrier," or "more cheerful" are often preferred.  This is partially due to the semantic shift of "gay" to primarily mean homosexual.  Using "gaier" might lead to confusion or misinterpretation, so consider your audience and context carefully.
