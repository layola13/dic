PHRASE->
(Since "dareth" is archaic, it is not used in modern phrases.  The following phrases use the modern form "dare":)
How dare you! = 你怎么敢!
I dare you to... = 我谅你不敢...
I wouldn't dare. = 我不敢。
Don't you dare! = 你敢! (as a warning)
I dare say... = 我想; 我敢说



注意事项: "Dareth" is an archaic form and is rarely used in modern English.  The modern equivalent is "dares."  Therefore, most of the examples above, while grammatically correct with "dareth," sound unnatural and are more commonly expressed using "dare," "dares," or "dared."
