PHRASE->
(While "linget" is a relatively uncommon term, and thus doesn't have many established phrases associated with it, here are some example sentences demonstrating its potential use in context):

Examine the linget for signs of inflammation. 检查小舌是否有炎症迹象。
The linget is located at the back of the tongue. 小舌位于舌头后部。
The doctor observed the movement of the linget during speech. 医生观察了说话时小舌的运动。

注意事项:

This word is relatively rare and may be considered technical or archaic.  "Uvula" and "epiglottis" are more commonly used, although they are not perfect synonyms. The uvula hangs down from the soft palate, while the epiglottis is a flap of cartilage that covers the windpipe during swallowing. "Linget" seems to refer to the base of the tongue, specifically the area just in front of the epiglottis.  Consult specialized medical dictionaries for precise definitions and usage.
