*Note:*  "Jiver" is primarily used in British English.  "Jibe" has more meanings and is more commonly used, especially in American English, where it often replaces "gybe" in nautical contexts.  The two words share etymological roots and are sometimes confused.  This entry focuses on "jiver" as requested, but includes "jibe" because of the close relationship and potential for confusion.
