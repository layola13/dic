microspore:/ˈmaɪkrəˌspɔːr/| n. |小孢子|A small spore, typically haploid, that develops into a male gametophyte in seed plants.|Microspores are produced within the anthers of flowering plants. 小孢子在开花植物的花药内产生。|The microspores developed into pollen grains. 小孢子发育成了花粉粒。| 近义词: pollen grain (in the context of seed plants) | 反义词: megaspore | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From micro- + spore.  "Micro-" comes from Greek "mikrós" meaning "small". "Spore" comes from Greek "spora" meaning "seed, a sowing".
