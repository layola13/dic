注意事项:

*  "Letts" (with a capital L) specifically refers to the people or the language of Latvia.  "letts" (lowercase) is archaic and no longer in common usage.  It used to refer to hindered or obstructed, derived from "let" meaning to hinder or obstruct.  Since the prompt provides no context to suggest this archaic meaning, the answer focuses on the Latvian meaning.

* While "Latvian" is generally preferred when referring to the language, "Letts" is still occasionally encountered, particularly in older texts.  Therefore, it's important to be aware of this usage.
