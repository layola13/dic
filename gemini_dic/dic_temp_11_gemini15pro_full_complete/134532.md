ETYMOLOGY->

From non- + licentiousness.  "Licentiousness" comes from the Late Latin licentiōsus, meaning "unrestrained, excessive," from licentia "freedom, license,"  from licēre "to be permitted."  Therefore, "nonlicentiousnesses" signifies the absence of unrestrained or excessive behavior, particularly regarding sexual morality.
