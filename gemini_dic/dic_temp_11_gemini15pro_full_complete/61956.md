emulsin: /ɪˈmʌlsɪn/ /iˈmʌlsən/ | n. | 乳糖酶，苦杏仁酶 | An enzyme found in almonds that catalyzes the hydrolysis of beta-glycosides. It's a mixture of enzymes, including beta-glucosidase, which breaks down amygdalin into glucose, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide. | Almonds contain emulsin, which breaks down amygdalin. 杏仁含有苦杏仁酶，可以分解苦杏仁苷。

Emulsin plays a crucial role in the release of cyanide from amygdalin. 苦杏仁酶在苦杏仁苷释放氰化物过程中起着至关重要的作用。

| 近义词: beta-glucosidase | 反义词: None | 词性: noun
