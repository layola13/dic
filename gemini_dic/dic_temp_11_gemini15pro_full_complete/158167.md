##platinocyanidenaɪd/ | n. | 铂氰化物 |  Platinocyanide refers to any salt containing the platinocyanide anion, $[Pt(CN)_4]^{2-}$.  These compounds are coordination complexes whereplatinum(II) is bonded to four cyanide ligands. They are known for their vibrant colors and interesting optical properties, particularly their fluorescence under UV light.  Manyplatinocyanides exhibit characteristic dichroism (different colors depending on the viewing angle).  Historically, they were important in early experiments on X-rays. | 例句：Barium platinocyanide was used in early X-raydetection because of its fluorescence. 钡铂氰化物因其荧光性而被用于早期的X射线探测。'化物晶体在紫外线照射下会发出强烈的荧光。 | 近义词：platinum cyanide (though this is less specific and may refer to complexes with varying numbers of cyanide ligands) | 反义词:  无直接反义词，由于其化学性质，很难找到一个与铂氰化物具有完全相反意义的词语。smoother pronunciation.^-$) ligand., as the crystals would glow when exposed to them.  This is less common now with more advanced X-ray detection technology.  The vibrant colors and optical properties of these compounds also make them of interest to material science researchers investigating applications in areas such as luminescence and optoelectronics.：**, magnesium) will lead to the formation of different platinocyanide salts, each exhibiting slightly varying properties. Some are more soluble in water than others. The synthesis of these compounds usually involves the reaction of a soluble platinum salt with a cyanide source, such as potassium cyanide.  Specific reaction conditions are necessary to control thedesired product.ide-based materials. 研究人员仍在研究铂氰化物基材料的新应用。etymology, usage, chemical properties, and a few example sentences in accordance with the requested format. Note that the antonym section remains difficult to fill due to the chemical nature of the term.
