indeterminates:/ɪnˈdɪˈtɜːrmɪnɪts/ | n. | 未定元，不定元，未知数 |A symbol or quantity that represents an unknown or unspecified value in an algebraic expression or equation, typically represented by letters like x, y, or z.  These are also sometimes called "variables" in less formal contexts, but in higher mathematics, "indeterminate" often implies a more abstract or symbolic meaning, without necessarily being tied to a specific numerical value. | The equation x² + y² = r² contains two indeterminates, x and y.  x² + y² = r² 这个方程式包含两个不定元，x 和 y。| synonyms: variables, unknowns | antonyms: constants, knowns | noun

indeterminate:/ˌɪndɪˈtɜːrmɪnət/ | adj. | 不确定的，不明确的，含糊的 | Not exactly known, established, or defined; vague.  This can refer to a quantity, a period of time, a result, or an outcome. It suggests a lack of clarity or precision. | The length of the meeting was indeterminate. 会议的时间不确定。| synonyms: uncertain, undefined, vague, ambiguous | antonyms: definite, precise, certain, clear | adjective
