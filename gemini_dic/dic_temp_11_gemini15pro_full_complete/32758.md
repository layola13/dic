ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *cēocian (attested only in the derived noun cēoce "jaw, cheek"), from Proto-Germanic *keukōną (compare West Frisian keakje "to chew", Dutch kauwen "to chew", German kauen "to chew"), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵeu̯h₂- "to chew". The semantic development is from "chew" to "choke" (on food).
