The word "caslow" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term specific to a certain field, a proper noun, or even a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests example usage of the word "what," I can provide that information.  Since "what" doesn't have synonyms or antonyms in the same way a noun or verb would, I will omit those sections.

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 |Used to ask for information specifying something.
