词源:  "Nariest" is the superlative form of "nary," which is an archaic and dialectal word meaning "not any" or "no." However, "nary" itself doesn't convey the sense of fear. The modern usage of "nariest" as "most scary" likely arose through a humorous or ironic application of "nary," possibly influenced by words like "eerie" or "scary." It's considered informal or slang.
