ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "debunk," which originated in the early 20th century (1923) in American English. It is a blend of "de-" (meaning "remove" or "reverse") and "bunk" (meaning "nonsense" or "humbug"). "Bunk" itself is short for "buncombe," referring to Buncombe County, North Carolina, where a congressman made a long, irrelevant speech supposedly "for Buncombe."
