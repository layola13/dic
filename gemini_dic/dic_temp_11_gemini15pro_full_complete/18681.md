词源: From Old French *besquether (unattested), from be- + Old French esquester "to acquire, seek," from Latin exquaesitus, past participle of exquirere "to search out," from ex- "out" + quaerere "to seek."  The meaning shifted from "to allow someone to seek and find" to "to leave to someone in a will."
