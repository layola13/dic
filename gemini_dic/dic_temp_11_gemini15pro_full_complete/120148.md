词源: From Middle English *mincemete, from Old French minced mete ("minced meat"). The word originally referred to a dish of finely chopped meat, often mixed with spices and other ingredients. Over time, the meat component became less common, and the term came to refer primarily to the sweet fruit mixture used in mince pies.
