Etymology:  From Old French *creue "increase, growth," from croistre "to grow," from Latin crescere "to arise, grow" (from PIE root *ker- (2) "to grow"). The sense shifted from "a reinforcement, an additional supply of men" to "a group of soldiers, a company" (mid-15c.), then to "any body of men associated for a purpose" (late 15c.). The nautical sense of "ship's company" is from c. 1600.
