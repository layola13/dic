词源:  "Nicerock" is a compound word combining "nice" and "rock." "Nice" comes from Old French "nice" meaning foolish, silly, simple, which evolved to mean pleasant or agreeable. "Rock" comes from Old English "rocc" referring to a large stone. As a combined word, it describes a good quality rock, but its usage is often sarcastic.
