choccies:/ˈtʃɒkiz/ | n. | 巧克力糖果 | An informal, primarily British term for chocolates.  Choccies is a plural noun. | My grandma always has a box of choccies in her living room. 我奶奶的客厅里总有一盒巧克力糖。| 近义词：chocolates, sweets, candy | 反义词: None (lacks a direct opposite) | 词性: Noun

Etymology:  Choccies is a diminutive form of "chocolate," arising from the addition of the suffix "-ie" (or "-y"), which often conveys a sense of smallness or endearment in English.  The doubled "ie" ("-ies") marks it as plural.  "Chocolate" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word "xocolatl," referring to a bitter chocolate drink.
