bimensal: /baɪˈmɛnsəl/ | adj. |  双月的；一月两次的 | Occurring twice a month or every two months.  The ambiguity arises because "bi-" can mean both "two" and "twice." Context is crucial for understanding the intended meaning. | The company publishes a bimensal magazine.  这家公司出版双月刊。| Synonyms: semimonthly (twice a month), bimonthly (every two months) | Antonyms:  weekly, monthly, annual | adjective

bimensal: /baɪˈmɛnsəl/ | n. | 双月刊物 | A publication issued twice a month or every two months.  Again, context is essential to disambiguate the meaning. | The bimensal arrived in the mail today. 这本双月刊今天寄到了。| Synonyms: semimonthly publication, bimonthly publication | Antonyms: weekly publication, monthly publication, annual publication | noun
