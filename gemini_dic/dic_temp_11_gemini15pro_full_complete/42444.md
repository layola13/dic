**词源:**

"counter-" (prefix):  From Old French "contre-" and Latin "contra" meaning "against" or "opposite".

"demonstration": From Late Latin "demonstrationem," meaning "a showing forth," from "demonstrare" "to point out, demonstrate," from "de-" "completely" + "monstrare" "to show."

"counterdemonstration" and "counterdemonstrator" therefore literally mean "a demonstration against" and "one who demonstrates against," respectively.
