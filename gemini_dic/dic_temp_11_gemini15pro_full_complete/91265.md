hydrogel:/ˈhaɪdrədʒɛl/| n. |水凝胶|A network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic, sometimes found as a colloidal gel in which water is the dispersion medium. Hydrogels are highly absorbent (they can contain over 99.9% water) natural or synthetic polymers. They also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue, due to their significant water content.|The scientists developed a hydrogel that can be injected into the body to repair damaged tissue. 科学家们开发了一种可以注射到体内修复受损组织的水凝胶。

The hydrogel dressing kept the wound moist and promoted healing. 水凝胶敷料保持伤口湿润并促进愈合。|近义词：hydrocolloid, polymer network|反义词:xerogel|词性:noun
