jairou: /ʒaɪˈruː/ (Hypothetical pronunciation as it's not a recognized English word) | n. |  旋转烤肉; 旋转肉串 |  A fictional or non-standard word possibly intended to represent a rotating spit of meat, similar to a gyro.  It could be a misspelling or a neologism. | Example:  The jairou sizzled on the grill, filling the air with delicious aromas. 旋转烤肉在烤架上发出咝咝声，空气中充满了香味。 | Example: He ordered a jairou sandwich with extra tzatziki sauce. 他点了一个加了酸奶黄瓜酱的旋转烤肉三明治。 | Synonym: gyro, shawarma, kebab | Antonym: N/A | Noun


Etymology:  Likely derived from the Greek word "γύρος" (gyros), meaning "turn" or "circle".  The "j" substitution might be influenced by languages where "g" before "i" is pronounced as a soft "j" sound.  Or, it could be a simple misspelling.
