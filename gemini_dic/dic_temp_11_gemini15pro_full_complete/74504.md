词源:  "frap" as a verb meaning "to bind with ropes" comes from the French word "frapper," which means "to strike" or "to wrap."  The noun "frap" for a blended iced drink is a more recent development, likely shortened from "Frappuccino," a trademarked name owned by Starbucks.  While the origin is different, the blended drink sense might be influenced by the idea of ingredients being "bound" together.
