gibbs:/ɡɪbz/| n.|吉布斯; 吉布斯自由能|Gibbs refers to Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American scientist who made significant contributions to physical chemistry, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics.  The term is often used in reference to the Gibbs free energy, a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure.|The Gibbs free energy helps determine the spontaneity of a reaction. |Synonyms: (For Gibbs free energy) free enthalpy|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym for a proper noun or a scientific concept like Gibbs free energy)|Proper Noun
