dereference:/diːˈrɛfərəns/| v. |解引用，取值|To access the value stored at a memory location pointed to by a pointer.  It involves retrieving the data that a pointer "points to".|The program dereferenced the pointer to get the value of the variable.|access, retrieve|assign|verb


USAGE->

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was dereferencing the pointer when the error occurred. = 当错误发生时，系统正在解引用指针。
He was dereferencing the pointer to update the data. = 他正在解引用指针来更新数据。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
