metamictization:/ˌmɛtəˌmɪktɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |非晶化，蜕晶质化|The process by which a crystalline material, especially a mineral, becomes amorphous (non-crystalline) due to radiation damage, typically from alpha particles emitted by radioactive elements within the material. This process disrupts the crystal lattice without altering the chemical composition.|例句：The metamictization of zircon crystals can be used to date geological events.  锆石晶体的非晶化可以用来确定地质事件的年代。

|例句：The degree of metamictization in a mineral can be determined by X-ray diffraction. 矿物中非晶化的程度可以通过X射线衍射来确定。 |近义词：amorphization|反义词：crystallization|词性：名词

PHRASE->
(Due to the specialized nature of the term "metamictization", common phrases are not readily available.  It is primarily used in scientific contexts within specific grammatical structures as demonstrated above.)


词源：From metamict + -ization.  metamict 源自希腊语 *μεταμεμιγμένος (metamemigmenos, “mixed up”)，来自 μετά (meta, “change”) + μείγνυμι (meignumi, “to mix”).
