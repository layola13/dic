chromoplastid:/ˈkroʊməˌplæstɪd/ | n. | 色素体；杂色体 | A plastid containing pigments other than chlorophyll, typically responsible for the yellow, orange, or red colors of fruits, flowers, and autumn leaves. | Example 1: The bright red color of tomatoes is due to the chromoplasts in the fruit. 番茄鲜红的颜色是由于果实中的色素体造成的。

Example 2: Chromoplasts develop from chloroplasts during the ripening process of fruits. 在果实成熟过程中，色素体由叶绿体发育而来。 | Synonym: plastid, chromatophore | Antonym: chloroplast | noun
