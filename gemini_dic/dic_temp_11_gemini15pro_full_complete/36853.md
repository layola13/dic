Etymology: From Late Latin *colonia*, from Latin colōnia "farm, landed estate, settlement," from colōnus "farmer, cultivator, planter, settler," from colō "I till, cultivate, inhabit," related to the root of Latin celer "quick."  The sense development was from "cultivated land," to "settlement," to "dependent settlement," to "territory under the jurisdiction of a distant power."
