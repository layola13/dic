nonconductivities:/ˌnɒnkɒndʌkˈtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 非导电性；不传导性 | The nonconductivities of these materials make them suitable for insulation. | These materials are prized for their high nonconductivities, preventing heat or electricity from passing through easily. |  近义词: insulating properties, resistance to conduction | 反义词: conductivities, conductance | 词性: 名词

Etymology:
non- (prefix): from Latin, meaning "not"
conductivity (noun): from conduct (verb) + -ivity (suffix). Conduct comes from Latin "conducere" (to lead together).  "-ivity" forms nouns denoting a state or property.  Therefore, conductivity refers to the property of being able to conduct something (like heat or electricity).
-ities (suffix):  plural form
