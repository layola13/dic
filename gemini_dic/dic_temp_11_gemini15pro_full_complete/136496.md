近义词: platonically, amicably, friendlily
反义词: romantically, passionately, amorously
词性: adverb

词源:
non- (prefix) + romantically (adverb)

"non-"  means "not" or "opposite of".  It comes from Latin.
"romantically" comes from "romance" (n.) + "-ically" (suffix).  "Romance" originally referred to vernacular languages derived from Latin (like French and Italian), and later came to mean stories of chivalry and love.  "-ically" turns a noun or adjective into an adverb.  Therefore, "nonromantically" combines the negative prefix with the adverb form of "romantic" to create its meaning.
