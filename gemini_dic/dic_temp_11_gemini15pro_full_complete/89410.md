homothallism:/ˌhəʊməˈθælɪzəm/ | n. | 同宗配合；自體受精 |  The condition in which sexual reproduction can occur within a single individual, without the need for a partner of a different mating type.  A fungus that exhibits homothallism can reproduce sexually by itself. | Example 1: Homothallism is common in some species of fungi. 同宗配合在某些真菌物种中很常见。

Example 2:  The researchers discovered that the fungus was homothallic, meaning it could self-fertilize. 研究人员发现这种真菌是同宗配合的，这意味着它可以自体受精。| 近义词: self-fertilization, self-compatibility | 反义词: heterothallism | 词性: noun
