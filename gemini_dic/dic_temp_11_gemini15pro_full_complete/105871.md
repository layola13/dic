词源:
The name "Kit Cat" or "Kit Kat" has been in use for food since the 18th century. A Kit-Cat Club existed in London in the early 1700s, and their mutton pies were called "kit-kats".  The current Kit Kat chocolate bar was launched in 1935 by Rowntree's of York, UK, under the name "Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp." It was renamed "Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp" in 1937, and the name was shortened to "KitKat" in 1940s. The origin of Rowntree's use of the name is uncertain, but it is believed to be a reference to the earlier Kit-Cat Club or the "kit-cat" pies.
