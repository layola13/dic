"Farite" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a slang term, or specific to a certain dialect.  I cannot provide a standard analysis for a non-existent word.

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling so I can give you the information you need.

However, if you're curious about how I *would* analyze a real word, I can demonstrate using the word "favorite" (a possible intended spelling of "farite"):

favorite: /ˈfeɪvərɪt/ (US) /ˈfeɪvərɪt/ (UK)| adj. n.|最喜欢的；特别喜爱的人（或物）|Something or someone that is preferred above all others.| My favorite color is blue. 我最喜欢的颜色是蓝色.| The library is my favorite place to study. 图书馆是我最喜欢学习的地方.|近义词：preferred, beloved, dearest|反义词：least favorite, disliked|词性: adjective, noun
