Etymology:
From counter- (against, opposite) + productive.  The prefix "counter-" comes from the Old French "contre-" and ultimately from the Latin "contra" (against). "Productive" comes from the Late Latin "productivus," from "productus" (produced), the past participle of "producere" (to lead forth, bring forth).
