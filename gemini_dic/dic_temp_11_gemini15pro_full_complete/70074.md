"Feudalod" isn't a recognized English word.  It seems like a potential misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) perhaps intended to be a combination of "feudal" and "lord".  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary definition. However, I can break down the likely intended meaning based on its apparent root words and provide information on those roots:

feudal: /ˈfjuːdəl/ | adj. | 封建的 | Relating to a social system prevalent in medieval Europe, characterized by hierarchical relationships based on land ownership and loyalty. |  The feudal system dominated Europe for centuries. |  近义词: manorial, aristocratic | 反义词: democratic, egalitarian | 词性: 形容词

lord: /lɔːrd/ | n. | 领主，主人 | A person who has authority, control, or power over others; a master or ruler. | The lord of the manor held great power. | 近义词: master, ruler, noble | 反义词: servant, commoner | 词性: 名词
