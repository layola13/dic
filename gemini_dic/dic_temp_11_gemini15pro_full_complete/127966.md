neostriatum:/ˌniːoʊstraɪˈeɪtəm/ | n. |新纹状体|A subcortical part of the forebrain and a critical component of the basal ganglia involved in motor control, motor learning, executive functions and behaviors, and emotions.  It receives input from the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain and is primarily composed of medium spiny neurons.|The neostriatum plays a crucial role in motor control.|近义词: striatum (often used interchangeably but technically a broader term including the neostriatum and other structures)|反义词:  None (anatomical structures don't typically have opposites)|词性:noun
