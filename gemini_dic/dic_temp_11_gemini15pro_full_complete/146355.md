overfit: /ˌoʊvərˈfɪt/ | v. n. | 过拟合 | A statistical model is said to be overfit when it is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. This can lead to poor predictive performance on new data, as the model may be "memorizing" the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns. | The model overfitted the training data and performed poorly on the test set. 该模型对训练数据过拟合，在测试集上表现不佳。

The complex model, prone to overfitting, failed to generalize to unseen data.  这个复杂的模型容易过拟合，无法泛化到未见过的数据。| 近义词: overtrain | 反义词: underfit | 词性: 动词, 名词
