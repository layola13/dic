macro-instruction:/ˈmækroʊ ɪnˈstrʌkʃən/ | n. |宏指令|A single instruction that expands automatically into a set of instructions to perform a particular task.  A macro simplifies programming by allowing the programmer to use a single command to represent a complex sequence of operations.|The programmer used a macro-instruction to simplify the code for file input/output.|Synonyms: macro, macrocommand|Antonyms: microinstruction|Noun
