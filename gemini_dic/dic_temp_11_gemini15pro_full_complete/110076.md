lichenizations:/ˌlaɪkənɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. |地衣化，地衣化作用| The process of becoming covered with lichens or developing lichen-like characteristics.  It can refer to the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria that forms lichens, or to the appearance of surfaces that resemble lichens due to weathering or other factors.| The lichenizations on the rocks indicated a long period of exposure to the elements.| 近义词: lichen growth, colonization by lichens | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider "lichen removal") | 词性: Noun
