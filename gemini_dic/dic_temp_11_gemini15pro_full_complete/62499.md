endothelium:/ˌɛndoʊˈθiːliəm/| n. |内皮|A thin layer of cells that lines the inner surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.|The endothelium plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow and vascular permeability. 内皮在调节血流和血管通透性方面起着至关重要的作用。|lining, inner layer| outer layer|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek ἔνδον (éndon, “within”) + θηλή (thēlḗ, “nipple”).  The term was originally used to describe the lining of the heart because it resembled the projections inside a nipple.
