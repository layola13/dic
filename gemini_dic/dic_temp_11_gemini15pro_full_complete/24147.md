词源:  From Middle English *briben, from Old French briber (“to beg, cadge, sponge”),  of uncertain origin, possibly related to a Germanic source akin to Old High German *breiban (“to break bread”). The original sense was "to steal scraps of food".  The meaning shifted to "extort money" and then to "give a bribe" in the 16th century.
