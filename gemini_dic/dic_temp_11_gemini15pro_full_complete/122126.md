ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (indicating something wrong or bad) + transcription (the act of making a written copy).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", meaning "changed, different, alternating." "Transcription" comes from Late Latin "transcriptionem," meaning "a copying across," from Latin "transcribere" "to copy across, transfer," from "trans" ("across") + "scribere" ("to write").
