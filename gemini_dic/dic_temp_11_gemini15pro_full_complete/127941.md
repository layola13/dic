neopallial: /ˌnē.ōˈpæl.i.əl/
adjective|新皮层的，新皮质的|Relating to the neopallium, the newer, outer layer of the cerebral cortex, involved in higher-level cognitive functions in mammals and especially developed in humans.|The neopallial cortex plays a crucial role in language processing. 新皮质在语言处理中起着至关重要的作用。|cortical, cerebral|paleopallium|adjective

Etymology:
neo- + pallial
neo- :  a combining form meaning “new,” “recent,” “revived,” “modified,” attached to stems of any origin.
pallial: relating to or resembling a mantle or pallium.  The pallium is the dorsal part of the mantle of a mollusk or brachiopod, or the cerebral cortex considered as the comparable part of the brain of a vertebrate.
