词源: From Portuguese mandarim, from Malay mantri ("minister, counsellor of state"), ultimately from Sanskrit mantrin ("counsellor").  Initially referring to officials of the Chinese empire, the word was later applied to the language they spoke, which became the standard language. The citrus fruit usage arose from the color of the robes worn by these officials.
