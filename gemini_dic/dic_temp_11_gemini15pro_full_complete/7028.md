PHRASE->
No common phrases exist for this non-standard term.  It's a concatenation of "and" and "security" and thus doesn't have standalone phrasal usage.  Instead, it's used within sentences where both "and" and "security" are relevant.


注意事项:

The term "andsecurity" is not a standard English word and its use is discouraged in formal writing or professional contexts.  It is likely a typo or informal shorthand.  Using "and security" (with a space) is the grammatically correct form.
