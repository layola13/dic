注意事项:

"kem" is a non-standard spelling and pronunciation, primarily used in certain dialects, particularly in parts of the UK.  The standard spelling is "whom" (objective case of "who").  While "kem" might be understood in informal contexts within those dialects, using "whom" or "who" is recommended for broader understanding and formal writing.

Since "kem" is a dialectal variant, providing standard dictionary-style entries with antonyms and synonyms is difficult.  The provided information reflects its usage as a question word equivalent to "who" or "whom."
