词源： "half-" (meaning partly) + "informingly" (adverb form of "informing," meaning providing information).  "Informing" comes from the Latin "informare," meaning "to shape, form, train, instruct, educate."  Therefore, "half-informingly" suggests providing information that is only partially shaped or complete.
