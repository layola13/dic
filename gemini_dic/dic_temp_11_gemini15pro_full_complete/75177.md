PHRASE->

(This word doesn't have common phrases associated with it like "what if". It primarily describes a physical characteristic.)


词源:  Likely from Old French *friseler, frequentative of friser "to curl, crisp," related to friser "to fry."  The sense evolved from the idea of the edges curling or crisping like something fried.
