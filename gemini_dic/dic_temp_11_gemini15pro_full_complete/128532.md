注意事项:

"Nextly" is not a standard English word. Using "next" as an adverb is grammatically correct and preferred.  While grammatically understandable, it sounds unnatural and should be avoided in formal and informal writing and speaking.  Use alternatives like "next," "subsequently," "then," or "afterward" instead.
