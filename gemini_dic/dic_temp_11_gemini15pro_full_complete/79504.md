From globe + -like.  "Globe" comes from the Late Middle English word "globe," borrowed from the Old French "globe," and ultimately from the Latin "globus," meaning "sphere, ball, round mass." The suffix "-like" is an Old English suffix meaning "having the form or qualities of," used to form adjectives.
