注意事项:
This word is extremely vulgar and should be avoided in any formal or polite context.  Its usage can be highly offensive.  There is no polite way to use this word.  Consider using less offensive synonyms like "nonsense," "rubbish," or "lies."


Since "bollockses" is already a plural form (of "bollocks"), the usage examples provided avoid further pluralization (e.g., "bollockseses") as this would be grammatically incorrect and sound unnatural. While technically a plural, it's often used as a mass noun like "nonsense."
