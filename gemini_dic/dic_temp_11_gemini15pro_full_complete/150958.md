##paramagnetism:/ˌpæræˈmæɡnɪtɪzəm/ | n. |顺磁性 |magnetism is a form of magnetism whereby certain materials are weakly attracted to an externally applied magnetic field.  Unlike ferromagnetism, which results in permanent magnetization, paramagneticmaterials only exhibit magnetism in the presence of an external magnetic field and lose their magnetism once the field is removed. This weak attraction is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material's atoms or molecules.  These unpaired electrons possess magnetic moments that tend to align with the external field, leading to a net magnetic moment in the material.  The degree of paramagnetism is often temperature-dependent, with weaker magnetism observed at higher temperatures due to increased thermal agitation that disrupts the alignment of the magnetic moments.由于其未配对的d电子而表现出顺磁性。, but with a different underlying mechanism), ferromagnetism (for stronger, permanent magnetism)of the magnetic response)..paramagnetic properties of certain atoms are exploited for medical imaging, and various types of sensors. The strength of paramagnetic response is often quantified by a parameter called magnetic susceptibility, which indicates how strongly a material responds to an applied magnetic field.
