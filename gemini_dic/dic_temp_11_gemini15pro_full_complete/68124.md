PHRASE-> (Due to the archaic and offensive nature of the word, common phrases are difficult to establish in modern, acceptable usage.  The examples below reflect historical usage, but are not recommended for current use.)

a bundle of fagots 一捆柴
gathering fagots  收集柴火

注意事项:

The word "faggot" is a highly offensive slur when used in reference to a homosexual person.  Its use should be avoided entirely in this context. While it has archaic meanings related to bundles of sticks and meatballs, even these uses can be problematic due to the potential for misinterpretation and offense.  Extreme caution is advised.
