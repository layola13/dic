注意事项:
"Monteo" is not a common English word.  It appears to be borrowed or adapted from Spanish or Italian, where "montare" can mean "to mount, assemble, or rise." In the provided context, it seems to be used to mean "to show off" or "to make a display of." While grammatically correct within the examples, it's worth noting its infrequent usage in standard English.  "Show off," "flaunt," or other synonyms are generally preferred.
