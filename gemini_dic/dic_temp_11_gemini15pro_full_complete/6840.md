词源:
From Late Latin *anathematicus, from Greek anathema "a thing accursed," literally "a thing devoted," from anatithenai "to set up, dedicate, devote," from ana- "up" + tithenai "to put, place."  The original sense was of something set aside for sacred purposes, but it came to be used for things devoted to evil, hence "accursed."
