conceptualism:/kənˈsɛptʃʊəlɪzəm/| n.|概念主义|A philosophy that emphasizes the importance of concepts or ideas in the acquisition of knowledge.  It asserts that the mind is actively involved in structuring and interpreting sensory information, rather than passively receiving it.  In art, it refers to a movement that prioritizes the idea or concept behind the work over its aesthetic or material form.|Conceptual art often challenges traditional notions of art by prioritizing the idea behind the work.  For example, a written proposal for a piece of art might be considered the artwork itself, rather than any physical manifestation of that proposal.|近义词:idealism, notion, abstraction|反义词:realism, materialism|词性:noun
