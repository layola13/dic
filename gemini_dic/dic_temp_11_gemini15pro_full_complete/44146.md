crith: /krɪθ/ | n. | 克里斯(氢气的质量单位) | A unit of mass equal to the mass of one liter of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure.  It is approximately equal to 0.08988 grams. | Example: The crith is an obsolete unit, rarely used in modern chemistry.  克里斯是一个过时的单位，在现代化学中很少使用。

Example:  Chemists in the 19th century used the crith to compare the relative weights of gases. 19世纪的化学家使用克里斯来比较气体的相对重量。 | 近义词:  (No direct synonym as it's an obsolete unit.  Closest concepts would be "atomic mass unit" or "molecular weight") | 反义词: (N/A) | 词性: noun
