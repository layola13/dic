注意事项:
词源：gaffe (n.) "blunder, social error," 1877, from French gaffe "blunder, awkwardness," which is of uncertain origin, perhaps from Provençal gafar "to gape, stare open-mouthed," or perhaps related to Old French gaffe "boat hook." The original sense in English might have been theatrical slang.

由于gaffes是gaffe的复数形式，因此没有独立的词源。

由于gaffe作为“鱼钩”的含义比较少用，所以例句和词组主要围绕“失误”这个含义展开。
