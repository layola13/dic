PHRASE->

词源:  "Bubblegum" comes from "bubble" and "gum."  "Gum" in this context refers to chewing gum, which originated from the chicle, a natural gum from trees.  The "bubble" part refers to the ability to blow bubbles with the gum.  Adding the apostrophe-s creates the possessive form "bubblegum's."
