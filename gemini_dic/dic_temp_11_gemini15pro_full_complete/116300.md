The word "massod" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a technical term specific to a narrow field, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, is it a name, a place, or related to a specific subject?


However, since the prompt requested example usage of "what," I can provide that information:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym:  (No direct antonym for "what") | pronoun
what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What do you want? 你想要什么？ | Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | determiner
what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask the reason for something | Example: What did you do that for? 你为什么那样做？ | Synonym: why | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | adverb
