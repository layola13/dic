PHRASE->
a glideless descent = 无滑翔下降
a completely glideless aircraft = 完全无滑翔的飞机
essentially glideless = 本质上无滑翔的
inherently glideless =  固有地无滑翔的
rendered glideless = 变得无滑翔


词源: "glide" + "-less".  "Glide" comes from Old English "glidan" meaning "to slip, slide, glide". "-less" is a suffix meaning "without" or "lacking".
