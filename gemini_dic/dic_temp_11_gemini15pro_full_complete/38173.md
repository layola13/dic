ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French compromiss-, present participle stem of compromettre  "to promise mutually, submit to arbitration," from Latin compromittere "to promise mutually, to bind by mutual agreement," from com- "together" (see com-) + promittere "promise" (see promise (v.)).  The original sense in English was legal, "to submit (a dispute) to arbitration," but this is now rare.  The meaning "to expose to discredit, disgrace, or suspicion" (1620s) developed from the notion of "bringing into question or dispute," especially one involving some scandalous matter.
