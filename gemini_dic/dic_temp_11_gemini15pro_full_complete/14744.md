awesomely:/ˈɔːsəmli/ | adv. | 极好地，非常地 | In a way that inspires awe or wonder; exceptionally well. | She sang awesomely at the concert. 她在音乐会上唱得非常好。 | 近义词: wonderfully, amazingly, incredibly, remarkably, fantastically | 反义词: terribly, awfully, poorly, badly | 词性: 副词

词源: From "awesome" + "-ly." "Awesome" comes from "awe" (from Old Norse "agi," meaning "fear, terror") + "-some" (a suffix meaning "causing or characterized by"). Originally, "awesome" meant "inspiring awe," often in a religious context.  Over time, the meaning shifted to include anything impressive or inspiring wonder.
