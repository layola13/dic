Etymology:
"Nonirrationalnesses" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "irrational", which itself combines "ir-" (a variant of "in-", meaning "not") with "rational".  "Rational" comes from the Latin word "rationalis," meaning "reasonable" or "having the faculty of reason," derived from "ratio," meaning "reason" or "calculation." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "nonirrational" into a noun.

Synonyms:
rationality
reason
sanity
reasonableness
logic

Antonyms:
irrationality
unreasonableness
illogicality
