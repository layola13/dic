注意事项:  "Cherrier" is not commonly used in modern English.  While grammatically correct, it has an archaic feel and is more likely to be encountered in older texts or those with a deliberately French-influenced style. Using "more cherished" or similar phrases would be more natural in most contemporary contexts.
