ETYMOLOGY->
From "news" + "dealer".  "News" comes from Middle English "newes", plural of "newe", meaning "new thing", ultimately from Latin "novus" (new). "Dealer" comes from Middle English "delere", from Anglo-French "deleir", meaning "to distribute, deal", ultimately from Latin "dēlēre" (to destroy, blot out, erase). Ironically, while the Latin root implies destruction, in English it evolved to mean distributing or handling.
