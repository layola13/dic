PHRASE-> (This word doesn't typically form set phrases. Its usage is largely literal as described above.)


词源:  "Boobing" is derived from "boob," a slang term for a woman's breast. The "-ing" suffix turns it into a gerund, describing the action of breasts bouncing or the act of staring at them.  "Boob" itself likely originated as an imitation of the shape and movement of breasts.
