heterothermy:/ˈhɛtərəʊθɜːrmi/ (US) /ˈhetərəʊθɜːmi/ (UK)| n. |异温性|The ability of an organism to regulate its body temperature to some extent, but not as effectively as a homeotherm (warm-blooded animal).  It's a state intermediate between poikilothermy and homeothermy.|Bats exhibit heterothermy, allowing their body temperature to drop when at rest.|Near synonyms: poikilothermy (although not precisely the same), ectothermy (partially)|Antonym: homeothermy, endothermy|noun
