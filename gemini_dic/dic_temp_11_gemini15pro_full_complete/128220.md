neurochordal:/ˌnjʊərəˈkɔːrdl/ | adj. | 神经脊索的 | Relating to or characteristic of the neurochord, a transient embryonic structure in chordates that gives rise to the central nervous system.  It lies dorsal to the notochord. |  Neurochordal cells differentiate into the neural tube. 神经脊索细胞分化成神经管。|  The development of the neurochordal tissue is crucial for the formation of the brain and spinal cord. 神经脊索组织的发育对大脑和脊髓的形成至关重要。 | 近义词: notochordal (though not precisely synonymous, they are closely related) | 反义词: None | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
neuro- (Greek): nerve, relating to nerves
chordal (Greek): relating to a chord or string, in biology relating to the notochord
