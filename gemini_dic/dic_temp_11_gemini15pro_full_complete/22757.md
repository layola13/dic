词源：
"Borrow" comes from Old English *borgian, meaning "to pledge, lend." "Trouble" comes from Old French trubler, from Vulgar Latin *turbulare, meaning "to disturb, confuse," ultimately from Latin turba "turmoil, crowd." The phrase "borrow trouble" likely arose from the idea of taking on or experiencing trouble prematurely, as if borrowing it from the future.
