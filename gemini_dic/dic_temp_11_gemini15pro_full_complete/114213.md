maidpale: /ˈmeɪdpeɪl/ | adj. | 苍白的，面色不好的 |  This word "maidpale" isn't a standard English word. It seems to be a combination of "maid" and "pale".  "Maid" refers to a female domestic servant, and "pale" describes someone with a lighter than usual skin tone, often due to illness or fear.  Therefore, "maidpale" could be interpreted as describing a maid who looks pale or unwell. |  (Since "maidpale" is not a recognized word, constructing a standard example sentence is difficult.  A creatively constructed example could be): The maidpale young woman struggled to carry the heavy tray.  面色苍白的年轻女佣吃力地搬着沉重的托盘。 | 近义词: pallid, wan, ashen | 反义词: flushed, rosy, ruddy | 词性: adjective
