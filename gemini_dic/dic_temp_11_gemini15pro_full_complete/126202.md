PHRASE->
(Since "mvy" is not a real word, these phrases are hypothetical examples of how it *might* be used if it were a word.)

average mvy 平均移动量
calculate the mvy 计算移动量
detect mvy 检测移动
track mvy 追踪移动
mvy sensor 移动传感器


注意事项: As mentioned repeatedly, "mvy" is not a recognized English word.  This entire analysis is based on a hypothetical scenario where it *might* be used as an abbreviation related to movement.  It has no established etymology, and the provided examples are purely speculative.
