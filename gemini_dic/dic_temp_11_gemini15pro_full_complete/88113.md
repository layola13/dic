词源:  From highjack, variant of earlier highwayman, meaning a robber who held up travelers on the road.  The term evolved to refer to robbing trucks on highways and later expanded to include other forms of armed robbery, especially of vehicles.  The spelling "hijack" became more common in the mid-20th century.
