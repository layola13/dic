melaphyre:/ˈmɛləˌfaɪər/| n. |黑榴辉岩; 暗玢岩|A dark-colored, fine-grained igneous rock, typically occurring in dikes and sills, composed chiefly of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene, with or without olivine. It is often altered and amygdaloidal.|Example 1: The dike was composed of melaphyre, a dark and dense volcanic rock. 这条岩脉由黑榴辉岩组成，一种黑色致密的火山岩。

Example 2:  Geologists identified the sample as melaphyre based on its mineral composition. 地质学家根据其矿物成分将样品鉴定为黑榴辉岩。|近义词：basalt, diabase|反义词: (No direct antonym for a specific rock type) |词性:noun
