词源：
"Freebird" as a concept representing freedom and independence predates the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and the restaurant chain.  The word itself is a simple compound of "free" and "bird," with the obvious metaphorical meaning.  The restaurant chain "Freebirds World Burrito" adopted the name to evoke a sense of freedom and customization in their menu.
