The word "arpen" is not a recognized English word. It might be a misspelling, a technical term specific to a niche field, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling so I can assist you.

If "arpen" is a specific term or a misspelling, please provide more context (e.g., the field it's used in, the sentence where you encountered it) so I can offer more tailored help.
