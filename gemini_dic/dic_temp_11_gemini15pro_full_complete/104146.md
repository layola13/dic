PHRASE->
(Since "Junes" is grammatically unusual, phrases involving it are contrived and not natural.)  It's more common to refer to specific years.  For example:

*  The June of 2023 was particularly hot. 2023年的六月特别热。
*  In the June of 1999, I graduated from college. 1999年的六月，我大学毕业了。
*  The Junes of my childhood were always filled with adventures.  我童年的六月总是充满了冒险。(Slightly more natural but still unusual. Better: The months of June in my childhood...)
*  He remembered the Junes spent in the countryside.  他记得在乡下度过的那些六月。(Again, slightly more natural but unusual.)
*  She reminisced about the Junes of her youth. 她回忆起她年轻时的六月。(Slightly more natural but unusual.)


注意事项:
As noted above, the plural "junes" is not commonly used in standard English.  It is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural. It's preferable to rephrase using singular "June" and specifying the years or using phrases like "the month of June" when referring to multiple instances.
