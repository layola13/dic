PHRASE->
(While "bit's" itself isn't used in standard phrases, here are some phrases using "bit":)
a bit of = 一点儿
bit by bit = 一点点地
quite a bit = 相当多
every bit as = 完全一样
not a bit = 一点也不


注意事项:
"bit's" is grammatically incorrect but commonly used informally, especially online.  It's better to use "bit" with possessive 's' only when referring to something like "a single bit's value". For general usage, rephrase the sentence to avoid using "bit's". For instance, instead of "The bit's importance is significant," use "The importance of the bit is significant."
