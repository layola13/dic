molybdic:/məˈlɪbdɪk/
| adj. |钼的；含钼的|Containing or derived from molybdenum.|Molybdic acid is used in the production of molybdenum-based catalysts.|近义词: molybdenum-containing|反义词: N/A|词性:形容词


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *molybdique*, from *molybdène* (molybdenum) + *-ique* (-ic).  Ultimately from Ancient Greek *μόλυβδος* (mólybdos, “lead”), as molybdenum ore was confused with lead ore.
