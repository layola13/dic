词源:
From Middle English *copel, from Old English *copp, from Proto-Germanic *kuppaz (“cup, bowl”).  Cognate with Dutch kop (“cup, head”), German Kopf (“head, cup”), Icelandic koppur (“cup”). The semantic shift from "cup" to "coping stone" likely arose from the resemblance of a rounded coping stone to an inverted cup.
