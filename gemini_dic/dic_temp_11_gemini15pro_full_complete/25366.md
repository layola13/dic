注意事项:

*  "Buke" is a misspelling of "bouquet."  While understandable phonetically, it's important to use the correct spelling in formal writing.
* The word "bouquet" originates from the French word "bosquet," meaning a small wood or grove.  This later evolved to refer to the fragrant herbs and flowers gathered from such a place.
