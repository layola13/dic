hyperintenseness:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛnsnəs/| n. |高信号强度|The state or quality of being hyperintense, often used in medical imaging to describe areas that appear brighter than normal.  It refers to increased signal intensity on certain MRI sequences (e.g., T2-weighted or FLAIR).|The MRI showed hyperintenseness in the white matter. 核磁共振显示白质高信号。|近义词：brightness, high signal intensity|反义词:hypointenseness, low signal intensity|词性:noun
Etymology:  From hyper- (meaning "excessive" or "above normal") + intense + -ness (suffix forming nouns indicating a state or quality).
