词源:
From Middle English *engel, *angle, from Old English engel (with hard g), from Late Latin angelus, from Ancient Greek ἄγγελος (ángelos, “messenger”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂énǵʰelos (“messenger”).  The hard g was restored in the 16th century due to the influence of the Latin and Greek forms.
