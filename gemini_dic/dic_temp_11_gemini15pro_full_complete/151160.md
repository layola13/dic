##paraxylene: 详细解析liːn/ | n. | 对二甲苯 |  A colorlessliquid aromatic hydrocarbon, a major petrochemical feedstock. It is one of the three isomers of dimethylbenzene, distinguished by having the two methyl groups located on adjacentcarbon atoms in the benzene ring.  | Paraxylene is a crucial component in the production of terephthalic acid, a vital building block for the manufactureof polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used extensively in plastic bottles and clothing fibers. | 近义词: dimethylbenzene (but not fully synonymous as it refers to all three isomers),  xylenes (again, not fully synonymous due tothe isomeric nature) | 反义词:  无明确反义词，但可以考虑与其他二甲苯异构体（邻二甲苯、间二甲苯）进行对比。 | 名词源:**This part derives ultimately from “xylol,” a term coined in the 19th century. The word itself is of uncertain etymological origin.  Some sources suggest a link to the Greek word ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood," reflecting the early extraction of this compound from wood tar. However, this connection is not definitively established.oxidized from paraxylene.  It's a key component in the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a widely used polymer for:油以提取有价值的组分，包括对二甲苯。：**economic activity.  The price of paraxylene fluctuates significantly based on supply and demand in the global petrochemical market.  Competition for market share among producers is fierce, requiring constant innovation in production technologies and efficiency.  Environmental concerns related to the production and disposal of paraxylene and its derivatives are also an increasinglyimportant consideration.
