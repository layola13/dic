PHRASE->

(Since "effulgently" is an adverb, it doesn't typically form set phrases.  It describes the manner of shining, so it's used with verbs relating to light and brilliance.)


词源:
From Latin effulgent-, effulgens, present participle of effulgere ‘shine forth’, from ex- ‘out’ + fulgere ‘to shine’.
