neomenoidea:/niːoʊmɛˈnɔɪdiə/| n.|新月贝类|A taxonomic superfamily of molluscs in the class Solenogastres, commonly known as the neomenioid aplacophorans.|Neomenoidea are a group of marine molluscs found in deep-sea environments.|近义词: Solenogastres (sometimes used interchangeably, but technically a broader class), Aplacophora (a larger group containing Solenogastres and Caudofoveata)|反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it's a taxonomic classification.  One could potentially contrast it with other mollusc groups like gastropods or bivalves, but these aren't true opposites.)|词性:noun
