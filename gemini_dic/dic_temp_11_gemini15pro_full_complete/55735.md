词源： "dive" + "bomb". "Dive" comes from Old English *dūfan (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *dūbijaną. "Bomb" comes from French bombe, from Italian bomba, ultimately from Latin bombus “a booming, humming sound.” The combination appeared in the early 20th century, initially referring to a type of firework, later to the military tactic.
