##planometer: /plænˈɒmɪtər/属性:** 名词 (n.)；求积仪are several types, but they all involve tracing a pointer around the boundary of the shape, and the mechanism mechanically calculates and displays the area.  Historically important insurveying and drafting, they are less common now with the advent of digital image analysis.仪精确地测定了形状不规则的地块面积。来计算蓝图上的面积。**词源:**the instruments developed gradually over the 19th century, with contributions from several inventors.  The precise origins are difficult to pinpoint to a single inventor or date, as improvements and modifications were made over time.are difficult to calculate using standard geometric formulas. This includes applications in:, planimeters (or digital equivalents) might be used for analyzing images such as X-rays, to estimate the size of organs or lesions.represent a fascinating example of mechanical computation and precision engineering.  They still serve as a useful example of a practical application of mathematics and mechanism design.
