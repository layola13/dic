endothecium:/ˌɛndoʊˈθiːsɪəm/ | n. | 内皮层 | The endothecium is the layer of cells immediately beneath the epidermis of the anther wall in flowering plants.  It plays a crucial role in anther dehiscence (splitting open) to release pollen. | The endothecium of this plant is well-developed.  这种植物的内皮层很发达。 |  The fibrous thickenings in the endothecium aid in the dehiscence of the anther. 内皮层中的纤维状加厚有助于花药的开裂。 | synonyms:  (no direct synonyms - can describe it as a 'sub-epidermal layer' in some contexts) | antonyms: N/A | noun
