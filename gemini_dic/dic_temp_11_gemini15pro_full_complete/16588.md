词源:  Likely a shortening of the proper name Barnaby, which through various linguistic shifts, became associated with noise and commotion, possibly influenced by words like "barn" (evoking a sense of bustling activity). Another theory suggests a connection to the now obsolete verb "barne," meaning "to brawl or fight."  Ultimately, the etymology remains somewhat uncertain.
