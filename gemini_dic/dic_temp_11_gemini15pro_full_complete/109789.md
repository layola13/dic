levorotation:/ˌliːvəʊrəʊˈteɪʃən/ /ˌlevəroʊˈteɪʃən/ | n. |左旋，左旋性 | The rotation of the plane of polarized light to the left, as viewed facing the light source.  |

Example 1: The levorotation of the compound was measured using a polarimeter.  这种化合物的左旋性是用旋光仪测量的。

Example 2:  Levorotation is an important property in the pharmaceutical industry, as different enantiomers of a drug can have different biological activities. 左旋性在制药工业中是一个重要的特性，因为一种药物的不同对映体可能具有不同的生物活性。

|Synonym: left-handed rotation, counterclockwise rotation | Antonym: dextrorotation, right-handed rotation | noun
