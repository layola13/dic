This analysis assumes "mis-sung" functions like other "mis-" prefixed words (e.g., misspelled, misheard).  It's not a common word, but it's understandable in context. The usage examples would be similar to those for "missing", but focusing on singing incorrectly.


If neither of these fit, please provide more context for a more accurate analysis.
