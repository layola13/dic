ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *lencten "spring," literally "long," from Proto-Germanic *langitinaz (source also of Old Frisian lengtene, Middle Dutch lente, Dutch lente "spring," Old High German lenzin, German Lenz "spring"), from PIE root *dlonghos- "long." The religious sense arose from the fact that Lent coincides with the lengthening days of spring.  来自古英语 *lencten “春天”，字面意思是“长的”，源自原始日耳曼语 *langitinaz（也是古弗里斯兰语 lengtene、中古荷兰语 lente、荷兰语 lente “春天”、古高地德语 lenzin、德语 Lenz “春天”的来源），源自 PIE 词根 *dlonghos- “长的”。 宗教意义源于四旬斋与春天白天变长的事实相吻合。
