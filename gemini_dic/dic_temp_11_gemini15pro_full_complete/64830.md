注意事项:
*  The word "especial" is becoming archaic and is often replaced by "special" in modern English.  "Especial" tends to emphasize a distinguished or exceptional quality, while "special" has a broader range of meaning.
*  While the word exists and is grammatically correct, its usage is declining and might sound slightly formal or old-fashioned in contemporary contexts.  Consider using "special" in most cases.
