circumdenudation:/ˌsɜːrkəmˌdɪnjuːˈdeɪʃən/ |/ˌsɝːkəmˌdɪnjuːˈdeɪʃən/| n. |剥蚀作用；环状剥蚀|The process of wearing away and removing the surface of a landmass by weathering, erosion, and transportation, resulting in the exposure of underlying rocks.  It often creates isolated hills or mountains.|The circumdenudation of the plateau revealed ancient volcanic formations.|Synonyms: denudation, erosion, weathering|Antonyms: deposition, aggradation|noun
