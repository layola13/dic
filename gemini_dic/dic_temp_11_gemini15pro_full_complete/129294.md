The word "noem" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a technical term in a specific field, a proper noun (like a name), or a slang/newly coined word.  If you can provide more context (where did you encounter this word?), I might be able to offer more assistance.

Since I cannot analyze "noem", I will use "name" as an example, following your requested format.
