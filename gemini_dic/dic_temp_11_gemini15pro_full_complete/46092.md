cyclostylar: /ˌsaɪkləˈstaɪlər/ | adj. | 环柱的，环绕花柱的 | Relating to or arranged around a style (the slender part of a pistil that receives pollen). | The cyclostylar arrangement of the stamens is a key characteristic of this plant family.  环柱雄蕊排列是该植物科的主要特征。 |  Example 2: The botanist identified the flower by its cyclostylar ovary.  植物学家通过环柱子房识别了这朵花。| 近义词:  peristylar (somewhat similar in concept) | 反义词:  N/A (difficult to define a direct opposite) | 词性: adjective
