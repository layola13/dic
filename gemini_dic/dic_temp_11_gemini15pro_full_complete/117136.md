Etymology:  From mean (adj.) + -ie (suffix forming diminutives and familiar nouns).  The adjective "mean" itself has a complex history, tracing back to Old English "gemæne" meaning "common," then developing senses of "lowly, inferior" and "stingy, ungenerous," eventually leading to the modern sense of "unkind."
