mmap:/ˈmæp/ (US), /mæp/ (UK)| n. v.|内存映射|A function that maps a file or device into memory, allowing access as if it were directly in RAM.  It creates a virtual address space that can be used to access the contents of the file or device. |例句：The mmap function allows efficient access to large files. mmap函数允许高效地访问大型文件。

例句：We used mmap to map the entire database into memory. 我们使用mmap将整个数据库映射到内存中。|近义词：map, memory map|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps unmap which is a function to remove the mapping) |词性: Noun (as the area of memory), Verb (as the act of mapping)
