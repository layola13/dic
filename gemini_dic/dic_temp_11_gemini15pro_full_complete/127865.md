Etymology:
From neo- + classical.  "Neo-" comes from Greek *néos* meaning "new, young, recent." "Classical" ultimately derives from Latin *classicus*, meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens," later associated with the highest standards of literature and art, particularly of ancient Greece and Rome.
