curvirostres:/ˌkɜːrvɪˈrɒstriːz/ | n. | 曲喙亚目 |A suborder of birds characterized by their curved beaks, including birds like parrots and cockatoos.  This term is outdated and no longer used in modern taxonomy. | This term is outdated, so an example sentence would be anachronistic.  A modern sentence might discuss how the term was used historically: "Historically, parrots and cockatoos were classified under the suborder Curvirostres due to their curved beaks." | 近义词: Psittaciformes (modern equivalent) | 反义词: N/A | noun
