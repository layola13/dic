neurones:/ˈnjʊərɒnz/ (UK), /ˈnʊrɑːnz/ (US)| n. |神经元|Nerve cells that transmit nerve impulses. These are the fundamental units of the nervous system, responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, sending motor commands to the muscles, and transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between.|The human brain contains billions of neurones.|Synonyms: nerve cells, neurons|Antonyms: N/A|noun

neurone (alternative spelling):/ˈnjʊərɒn/ (UK), /ˈnʊrɑːn/ (US)| n. |神经元|Same as "neurones," just a different spelling more common in American English. |Each neurone communicates with other neurones through specialized connections called synapses.|Synonyms: nerve cells, neurones|Antonyms: N/A|noun
