注意事项:  'found's' itself isn't commonly used outside of specific contexts like discussing a historical figure's possessions. It's more natural to use phrases like "the founder's..." or "the founders'..." depending on whether you're talking about a single founder or multiple founders.  Also, "found's" can be a contraction of "found is" which would have a completely different meaning. The analysis above focuses on the possessive form.
