costlewe: /ˈkɒstlɛːwə/ (This pronunciation is a best guess based on likely Old English pronunciation. No modern equivalent exists.) | adj. |  昂贵的，价值高的 |  From Old English "costlēas" (costly + -less, meaning *without cost*), ironically meaning "precious", "valuable". The negative suffix seems to have undergone semantic shift to a positive meaning, perhaps through implications of something being "beyond price". | This ring is costlewe.  这枚戒指很贵重。 | The king's costlewe crown was stolen. 国王的贵重王冠被偷了。 | synonyms: precious, valuable, dear, expensive | antonyms: cheap, worthless, inexpensive | adjective
