词源:  "Ceno" isn't a standard English word.  It likely comes from a Romance language, possibly Italian or Spanish, where words like "cena" (Italian) and "cena" (Spanish) mean "dinner" or "supper".  It could also be a regional or dialectal variation.  If you intended a different word, please clarify.
