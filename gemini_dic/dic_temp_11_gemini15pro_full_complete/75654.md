PHRASE->
*This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases. It's more of a standalone noun.*  这个词通常不会出现在常用短语中。它更像是一个独立的名词。
Since "fuju" is not a common English word (it seems to be of Japanese origin perhaps meaning "accessory" or "attached building"), it is unlikely to have established English phrases associated with it.  由于“fuju”不是一个常见的英语单词（它似乎源于日语，可能意思是“附属”或“附属建筑”），因此不太可能与之相关的既定英语短语。
