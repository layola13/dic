neurophysiologist:/ˌnʊəroʊˌfɪziˈɑːlədʒɪst/| n. |神经生理学家|A specialist in neurophysiology, the branch of physiology that deals with the functioning of the nervous system.|例句：The neurophysiologist studied the brain waves of the patient. 神经生理学家研究了病人的脑电波。

例句：The neurophysiologist explained how the nervous system controls muscle movement.  神经生理学家解释了神经系统是如何控制肌肉运动的。|近义词：neuroscientist|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

Etymology:  From neuro- + physiologist.  "Neuro-" comes from Greek "neuron" meaning "nerve," and "physiologist" comes from  "physiology" which itself derives from Greek "physis" meaning "nature, origin" + "-logia" meaning "study of."
