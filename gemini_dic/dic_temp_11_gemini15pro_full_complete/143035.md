outblest:/ˌaʊtˈblest/
| adj. | 最幸福的，最受祝福的 |  Surpassed in blessedness; most blessed.  This word is archaic and rarely used. |  He was the outblest of all men, living a life of peace and prosperity. 他是所有人中最幸福的，过着和平与繁荣的生活。 |  blessed, fortunate, lucky | cursed, unfortunate, unhappy | adjective

Etymology:
"out-" (Old English *ūt-, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *ūt-, *ūz-) + "blessed" (from Old English blēdsian, meaning "to bless," from Proto-Germanic *blodison, from *bloda "blood").  The prefix "out-" here functions as an intensifier, meaning "exceedingly," similar to its use in words like "outdo" or "outlive."
