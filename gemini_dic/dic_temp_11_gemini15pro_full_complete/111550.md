ETYMOLOGY->
From the noun 'lob' (a high, slow throw), which likely originated in the 16th century. The exact origin is uncertain, but it may be related to the Middle Dutch word 'lobben' meaning 'to hang loosely'. The sense of political lobbying developed in the 19th century, referring to the practice of frequenting the lobbies of legislative bodies to influence politicians.
