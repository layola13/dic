词源:
From Spanish *lio*, ultimately from Latin *ligō* ("to bind, tie").  While the primary meaning relates to a bundle or mess, in some dialects, particularly in the Caribbean, it has evolved to specifically refer to a male lion.  It's important to note that this usage is not standard across all Spanish-speaking regions.
