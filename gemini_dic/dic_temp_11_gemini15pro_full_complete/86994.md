PHRASE-> (Since "hennes" is a Norwegian word, it's not typically used in English phrases.  These examples illustrate possessive pronouns in English.)

That car is hers, not his. = 那辆车是她的，不是他的。
The decision is hers to make. = 这个决定由她来做。
It's all hers. = 都是她的。

注意事项:

Since "hennes" is a Norwegian word, its usage examples primarily apply within Norwegian grammar contexts.  The English equivalent "hers" would be used in English sentences.
