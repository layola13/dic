词源:
From Middle English *mener*, comparative of *mene* (“mean, common, vile, poor, inferior, moderate”), from Old English *mǣne* (“common, general, public, mean, vile, base, worthless, low”), from Proto-Germanic *mainiz* (“common, general, public”), from Proto-Indo-European *moyno-*. Cognate with Old Frisian *mēne* (“common, general, universal”), Old Saxon *mēni* (“common”), Middle Dutch *mene* (“common, public, general, universal, frequent”), Old High German *meini* (“common, false, deceitful”), German *mein* (“false, deceitful, perfidious”).  The semantic development from “common” to “poor, inferior” and then to “stingy” and “unkind” occurred in English.
