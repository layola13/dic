注意事项:
"Gise" is an archaic word and is rarely used in modern English.  More common synonyms like "dress," "attire," "clothe," "array," and "adorn" are generally preferred.  Therefore, while the above grammatical examples are correct, they sound unnatural in contemporary English.  It's crucial to be aware of this when considering using the word.
