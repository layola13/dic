larrikin: /ˈlærɪkɪn/ (Australian English) | n. | 流氓，捣蛋鬼，小混混 | A young person, typically male, who behaves boisterously and disruptively, often engaging in petty crime. |  He was a bit of a larrikin in his youth, always getting into trouble. 他年轻时有点像个小混混，总是惹麻烦。 |  Synonyms: hooligan, rascal, scoundrel, rogue, miscreant | Antonyms: conformist, goody-two-shoes | Noun

Etymology:  The word's origin is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory traces it to the mid-19th century in Melbourne, Australia. One story attributes it to a corruption of the Irish surname "Larry Kelly" used by a witness in a court case who, when asked the defendant's name, replied "Larry Kelly, your honour," which the judge misheard as "larrikin." Another theory suggests it comes from the Shelta word "lárrikin," meaning "boisterous youth."
