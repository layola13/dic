词源：From Old French *laiere (compare Old North French laire), of uncertain origin. Perhaps a variant of Old French leire ("bedding, lair"), from Frankish *legar ("bed, couch"), from Proto-Germanic *legrą ("bed, place to lie down").  Alternatively, from Vulgar Latin *lectaria ("bed cover"), from Latin lectus ("bed").
