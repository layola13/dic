oxidability:/ˌɒksɪdəˈbɪləti/ | n.| 可氧化性，氧化能力 |  易于氧化的性质或程度；物质被氧化的难易程度。This refers to how easily a substance can be oxidized,  a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons or an increasein oxidation state.  Oxidizability is often influenced by factors such as the presence of other reactive substances, temperature and the chemical structure of the substance itself. |The high oxidability of iron contributes to its rusting.  铁的高氧化性导致其生锈。The oxidability of this metal is quite low under normal conditions. 在正常条件下，这种金属的可氧化性非常低。| 近义词：oxidizability  | 反义词：resistance to oxidation (抗氧化性)  | 名词？you done? = 你做了什么？忙什么？= 她当时在想什么？the accident? = 事故发生前你一直在做什么？会怎么样？by next year? = 到明年你会取得什么成就？have been studying by graduation? = 到毕业时她将已经学习了多久？态:？= 搞什么鬼！ability" signifies the capacity or potential for something to happen.  Therefore, "oxidability" directly points to the potential or capacity of a substance to undergo oxidation.  The history of understanding oxidation is deeply entwined with the discovery and characterization of oxygen as a key element participating in many chemical reactions.  Early chemistsnoted the role of oxygen in numerous reactions involving rusting, burning, and other changes. This led to the coining of related terms and concepts.
