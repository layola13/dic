ETYMOLOGY->
From "Jack" (a common male name) + possibly influenced by "kangaroo."  Originally referred to a newly arrived, inexperienced young man, often from Britain, seeking work on Australian outback stations.  The term may have gained its association with "kangaroo" due to the perceived "hopping" or traveling nature of these young workers as they moved from station to station.
