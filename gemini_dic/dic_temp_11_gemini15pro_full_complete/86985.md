henia: /ˈhiːniə/ | n. |  单性生殖 | Parthenogenesis, a type of asexual reproduction in which the offspring develops from an unfertilized egg. |  Henia is a form of asexual reproduction observed in some insects.  单性生殖是在某些昆虫中观察到的一种无性繁殖形式。 | 近义词: parthenogenesis, asexual reproduction | 反义词: sexual reproduction | 词性: noun

词源:  From Greek "hen" (one) + "-ia" (suffix forming abstract nouns).  源自希腊语 "hen" (一) + "-ia" (构成抽象名词的后缀)。
