词源:

"Bitch" originally referred to a female dog.  Over time, it became a derogatory term for a woman, often implying maliciousness or unpleasantness.  "Bitch up" likely emerged as a slang expression, combining the negative connotations of "bitch" with the verb "up," suggesting a worsening or ruining of a situation.  The complaining/whining sense likely developed from the association of "bitching" with nagging or complaining.
