collapsar:/kəˈlæpsɑːr/
n.
坍缩星；塌缩星
A massive star that undergoes gravitational collapse, especially one that forms a black hole.  A hypothetical end-state of a massive star's evolution, resulting from its core collapsing to form a black hole.
The collapsar emitted a powerful burst of gamma rays.  坍缩星发出强大的伽马射线暴。
Astronomers believe some gamma-ray bursts are caused by collapsars. 天文学家认为一些伽马射线暴是由坍缩星引起的。
Synonym: hypernova, supernova
Antonym: (No direct antonym, could consider "stable star")
noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From "collapse" + "-ar" (similar to "pulsar" and "quasar"). "Collapse" comes from Latin "collapsus," the past participle of "collabi" (to fall together).
