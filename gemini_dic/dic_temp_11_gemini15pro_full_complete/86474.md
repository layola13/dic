ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *hæðen (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *haithanaz (“dwelling on the heath”), from *haithiz (“heath, uncultivated land”). Cognate with Old Norse heiðinn (“heathen”), Old Saxon hēthin, Old High German heidan, Gothic 𐌷𐌰𐌹𐌸𐌽𐍃 (haiþns, “of the nations, Gentile”).  Originally referred to those living in rural areas, outside the reach of established Christian churches, hence "uncivilized" or "pagan."
