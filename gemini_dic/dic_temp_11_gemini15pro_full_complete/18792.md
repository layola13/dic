词源:  "Beroy" appears to be a variant spelling of "hero." The word "hero" ultimately comes from the Greek word "ἥρως" (hērōs), which referred to a demigod or a person of superhuman strength or courage. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any individual admired for exceptional qualities or achievements.
