leful: /ˈliːfʊl/ | adj. | 合法的；法律许可的 | Lawful means permitted, allowed, or recognized by law. |  The contract is perfectly leful.  这份合同完全合法。 | Synonyms: legal, legitimate, licit | Antonyms: illegal, unlawful, illicit | adjective

Etymology:
From Middle English *lefful*, from Old English *lēafful* (“permissible, allowable, lawful”), equivalent to *lēaf* (“permission”) + *-ful*.  Cognate with Dutch *lieflijk* (“lovely, amiable”), German *lieblich* (“lovely, charming”).  The sense development from "permitted" to "agreeable" is paralleled in other Germanic languages. While the modern primary meaning relates to law, older senses related more to permission or agreement.
