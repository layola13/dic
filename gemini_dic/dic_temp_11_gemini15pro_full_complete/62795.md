ETYMOLOGY->
From Anglo-French engrosser "to make a rough copy, buy up wholesale," from en- "in" + grossier "wholesale dealer, large."  The original meaning was related to buying up goods in bulk, later extending to the idea of taking up all of someone's attention.  The legal sense of creating a final, official copy of a document also developed from the idea of creating a complete and authoritative version.
