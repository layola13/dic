Etymology: The word "nontextually" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "textual" (relating to or consisting of text) and the suffix "-ly" (forming adverbs). "Textual" ultimately derives from the Latin word "textus," meaning "tissue" or "structure," which later evolved to refer to written or printed material.
