ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *oblātus, past participle of oblāre (“to flatten, to offer”), from ob- (“towards, against”) + lātus (“carried, borne”).  The geometric sense comes from the idea of a sphere being "carried towards" the poles and therefore flattened.  The religious sense derives from the idea of offering oneself to God.
