coolung: /ˈkuːlʌŋ/ (Pronunciation may vary depending on regional dialect, no established standard pronunciation found) | n. | クーロン (Japanese for "Coulomb") | A unit of electric charge.  Derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb's name.  Likely represents a misspelling or a phonetic transcription.  Refers to the SI unit of electric charge, equal to the quantity of electricity conveyed in one second by a current of one ampere. | Example: The battery stores a charge of several coolungs. 电池储存了几个库仑的电荷。 | Example:  The flow of one coolung per second constitutes one ampere. 每秒一库仑的流量构成一安培。 | Synonym: coulomb | Antonym: N/A (Units of measurement typically don't have antonyms) | Noun
