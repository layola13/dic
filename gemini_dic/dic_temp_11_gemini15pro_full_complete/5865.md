The word "ambagitory" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you meant a different word, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help.

If "ambagitory" is indeed a neologism you encountered, please provide the context where you saw it, and I may be able to offer some speculation on its intended meaning.


Since I can't analyze "ambagitory," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "question":

question: /ˈkwɛstʃən/ | n. v. | 问题；疑问；询问 | A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information. | Example: She asked a difficult question. 她问了一个难题。

Example:  He questioned the witness. 他询问了证人。| Synonym: query, inquiry, interrogation | Antonym: answer, reply | noun, verb
