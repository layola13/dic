grassor:/ˈɡræsər/| n.| 食草动物 | An animal that feeds chiefly on grass. | Example:  Cows are grassors.  牛是食草动物。
Example: The African savanna is home to many different grassors. 非洲大草原是许多不同食草动物的家园。 | 近义词: herbivore, grazer | 反义词: carnivore, predator | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Latin *grassator*, from grassari "to attack, raid, rob," from gradior "to walk, step, go." The meaning shifted from "one who raids" to "one who grazes" due to the similarity in sound and perhaps a perceived connection between animals "raiding" fields of grass.
