词源：black + mail.  "Black" in this context means evil or wicked, and "mail" originally referred to rent or tribute, often extorted.  So, "blackmail" literally meant a wicked or unjust payment.  The word's origins trace back to the Scottish Borders in the 16th century, referring to protection money paid to Border Reivers (raiders) to avoid being plundered.
