词源:  "decreaseless" is formed by combining the verb "decrease" with the suffix "-less," which means "without" or "lacking."  "Decrease" itself comes from the Old French "decreiss-" (present participle stem of "decreistre"), from Latin "decrescere," meaning "to grow less," from "de-" (down, away) + "crescere" (to grow).
