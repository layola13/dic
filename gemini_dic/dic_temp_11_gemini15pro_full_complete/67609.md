PHRASE->
Currently, there are no common phrases specifically using "extravascularly".  This is because it's a technical medical term generally used in specific scientific or clinical contexts.  Phrases describing drug administration routes are more common, such as "intravenous injection," "subcutaneous injection," or "oral administration."


注意事项:  Because "extravascularly" is a highly specific medical term, it's less likely to appear in everyday language and therefore doesn't have common phrases associated with it.
