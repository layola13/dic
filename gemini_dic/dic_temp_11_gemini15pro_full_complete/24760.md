brookite:/ˈbrʊkaɪt/
n.
板钛矿
A mineral form of titanium dioxide, TiO₂, occurring as orthorhombic crystals, typically reddish-brown to black.
Brookite is a polymorph of titanium dioxide, meaning it has the same chemical composition as rutile and anatase but a different crystal structure.
Brookite is often found in alpine veins and certain metamorphic rocks. 板钛矿经常在高山的矿脉和某些变质岩中被发现。
Near synonyms:  rutile, anatase (as polymorphs of TiO₂)
