diatomicities:/ˌdaɪətəˈmɪsɪtiz/| n. |双原子性；双原子分子|The state or quality of being diatomic; the number or proportion of diatomic molecules in a substance.|The diatomicities of the gases in the atmosphere are important for understanding their reactivity.|近义词：diatomic character|反义词: polyatomic character|词性:noun

Etymology:  From diatomic + -ity.  "Diatomic" comes from di- (two) + -atomic (relating to atoms).  Ultimately from Greek di- (two) and atomos (indivisible).
