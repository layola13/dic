gamomorphism:/ˌɡeɪməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 同态 | A structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (e.g., groups, rings, vector spaces). | The isomorphism between the two groups is a gamomorphism that also has an inverse. 这两个群之间的同构是一个也具有逆元的同态. | synonym: homomorphism, morphism | antonym:  (No direct antonym exists, but a non-structure-preserving map could be considered an opposite concept.) | noun
