minkowski:/mɪŋˈkɔfski/ | n. |  闵可夫斯基 (人名); 闵可夫斯基空间 (数学概念) |  Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909) was a German mathematician known for his work in geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics.  He is perhaps best known for his formulation of Minkowski spacetime, a four-dimensional mathematical structure that combines three-dimensional space and time. This concept is crucial to Einstein's theory of special relativity. |  Minkowski space is fundamental to understanding relativity. 闵可夫斯基空间是理解相对论的基础。 |  Einstein, spacetime, relativity, geometry | N/A | noun
