ETYMOLOGY->
From meaning + -ful + -ly.  Meaning comes from Old English mænan "to mean, intend, signify," from Proto-Germanic *mainjanan "to think, have in mind" (source also of Old Frisian mena, Old Saxon menian, Old High German meinen, German meinen "to think, intend, mean," Gothic munan "to think, consider").  -ful is a suffix meaning "full of, characterized by," from Old English -ful.  -ly is a suffix forming adverbs from adjectives.
