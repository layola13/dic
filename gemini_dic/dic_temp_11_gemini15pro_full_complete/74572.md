From Middle English *fraucht, *fraughte, from Middle Dutch *vracht (“freight, cargo”), from vrachten (“to load, freight”), from Proto-Germanic *fraχtijaną (“to load”), from *fraχtiz (“freight, cargo”). Cognate with German Fracht (“freight, cargo”), Icelandic frakt (“freight”).  The original meaning referred to a ship loaded with cargo; the figurative sense of "laden, filled (with something undesirable)" developed later.
