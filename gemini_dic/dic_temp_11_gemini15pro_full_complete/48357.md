Etymology:
From French *déculasser*, "to remove the breech of a gun," figuratively extended to "expose, unmask."  Derived from *cul*, meaning "bottom" or "rear," and *dé-*, a prefix meaning "removal" or "reversal." The term's evolution suggests a metaphorical link between exposing the breech of a gun (making it vulnerable) and exposing someone's scandalous secrets.
