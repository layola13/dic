注意事项:

"Och" is primarily used in Scottish English and is less common in other dialects.  It conveys a mild emotional tone and is often used to express surprise, realization, or slight disappointment. As an interjection, its meaning is highly context-dependent.  While it can sometimes be translated as "oh" or "ah," it often carries a slightly different nuance. As a noun, it refers to a small stream, primarily in Scottish contexts.
