词源:  "Maced" as in "intoxicated" originates from Jamaican Patois. Its connection to marijuana use likely emerged in the late 20th century. "Maced" as in "defeated" is likely a more recent slang usage, possibly influenced by the idea of being "beaten down" or "mace-d" (as with pepper spray, though the connection is likely figurative).
