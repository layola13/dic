注意事项:

* "Methal" appears to be a misspelling, or an archaic/variant spelling of "methyl" (in organic chemistry) or "metal" (in materials science).  The provided information assumes the intended words are "methyl" and "metal" and addresses both contexts.  If a different meaning is intended, please clarify.
* The provided antonyms and synonyms are context-dependent.  
* The word "methal" itself doesn't have robust usage examples in modern English. The examples are crafted to illustrate the usage of the intended words ("methyl" and "metal").
