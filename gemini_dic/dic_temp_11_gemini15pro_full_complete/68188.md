n.
昏厥；晕厥
the state of being faint, or a sudden, brief loss of consciousness

近义词: blackouts, syncope, swoons, dizziness, lightheadedness
反义词: consciousness, alertness

词性: 名词 (plural noun)
词源: From faintness + -es (plural suffix).  Faintness itself derives from the adjective "faint," which comes from Old French "feint," past participle of "feindre" (to feign, pretend), ultimately from Latin "fingere" (to shape, mold, devise).  The original sense of "faint" was thus "feigned," referring to a pretended weakness or illness.
