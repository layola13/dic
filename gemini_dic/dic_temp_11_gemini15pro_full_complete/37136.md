词源:  "Come hither" is a literal command to "come here," but with implications of seduction or enticement. The phrase itself dates back to the 16th century.  The noun form, "come-hithers," emerged later, likely in the 19th or early 20th century, to describe the alluring looks or gestures that accompany such a command.
