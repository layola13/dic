注意事项:
The plural form "agricultures" is very uncommon and generally considered awkward.  It's almost always better to use the singular form "agriculture" instead.  While grammatically correct, it lacks common usage and sounds unnatural in most contexts.  I have provided examples, but highlighted where the singular form is strongly preferred.
