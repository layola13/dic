ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "cheater," meaning "to deceive, trick, defraud."  Ultimately from Vulgar Latin "*excapitare," meaning "to remove the head," from "ex-" (out) + "capitare" (to take the head), implying confiscation or deprivation. The meaning shifted from confiscation of property to deception in general.
