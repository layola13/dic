词源: From the Old French word "descorder" meaning "to be discordant," ultimately from the Latin "discordare," meaning "to disagree."  The "dis-" prefix indicates negation or opposition, and "cordare" means "to be of one heart or mind."  Therefore, the original sense of the word conveyed a lack of agreement or harmony.
