diabatic:/ˌdaɪəˈbætɪk/| adj.|绝热的，非绝热的|Relating to or denoting a process in which no heat is transferred to or from the system.|The diabatic processes are important in meteorology.|近义词:adiabatic (when referring to a process with no heat transfer), non-adiabatic|反义词:adiabatic (when referring to a process *with* heat transfer)|词性:adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *diabatós* "passable," from *diabaínein* "to go across," from *dia-* "through" + *baínein* "to go."  The term was originally used in thermodynamics to describe a process where heat can be exchanged with the surroundings.
