crumminess's:/ˈkrʌminəsɪz/ | n. |糟糕的品质；低劣的状态 | The crumminess's of the hotel room was appalling.  | The sheer crumminess's of the situation was overwhelming. | 近义词: awfulness, shoddiness, inferiority | 反义词: excellence, quality, superiority | 词性: 名词

词源:  From "crumby" (1896, American English slang) meaning "lousy, inferior," likely influenced by "crumb" suggesting something broken down or in small, worthless pieces.  The "-ness" suffix turns it into a noun indicating a state or quality. The additional " 's " indicates possession, although its usage is uncommon and often considered grammatically incorrect. It's more natural to say "the crumminess of something" rather than "something's crumminess's."
