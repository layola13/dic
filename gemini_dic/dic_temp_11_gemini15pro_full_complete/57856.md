词源: From Middle English *drest, dressed, past participle of dressen, from Old French dresser (“to straighten, arrange, prepare”), from Frankish *drahjan (“to draw, pull”), from Proto-Germanic *draganą (“to draw, pull, drag”).  The use of "drest" as the past participle of "dress" is archaic.  While still encountered in some dialects and older texts, "dressed" is the standard modern form.
