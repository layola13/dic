non-stoichiometric:/ˌnɒnˌstɔɪkiəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 非化学计量的 |  Describing a compound whose composition cannot be expressed as a simple ratio of whole numbers.  This often occurs in compounds involving transition metals or other elements with variable oxidation states where defects in the crystal lattice lead to deviations from ideal stoichiometry. |  Example:  Many transition metal oxides exhibit non-stoichiometric behavior. 许多过渡金属氧化物表现出非化学计量行为。

Example:  The non-stoichiometric composition of the material affected its electrical conductivity. 该材料的非化学计量组成影响了其导电性。| Near synonyms: nonintegral, disproportionate | Antonyms: stoichiometric | word class: adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From "non-" (not) + "stoichiometric" (from Greek "stoicheion" meaning element + "metron" meaning measure).
