词源:
This word is a superlative form of "Cockney," which originally referred to people born within earshot of the Bow Bells (the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow church in London). Over time, it came to be associated with a specific dialect and accent characteristic of the East End of London.  The "-est" suffix is added to create the superlative form, meaning "most Cockney."
