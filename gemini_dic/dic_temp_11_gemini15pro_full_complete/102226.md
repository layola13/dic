ited:/ɪtɪd/ | adj. | 受限制的，受约束的 | Limited or restricted. |  The company's growth was ited by the lack of funding.  公司的发展受到资金短缺的限制。| 近义词: restricted, confined, limited, constrained | 反义词: unlimited, unrestricted, boundless | 词性:形容词

词源：From the Latin word "limitare" meaning "to bound, limit."  The "-ed" suffix transforms the verb "limit" into the adjective "limited."  Over time, the "l" was often dropped in pronunciation, leading to the variant "ited," though "limited" remains the standard spelling.
