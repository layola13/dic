PHRASE-> (Not applicable for "druggiest" due to its specific and negative connotation.  It's not commonly used in phrases.)


词源:  "Druggiest" is derived from "drug" + "-y" (forming an adjective meaning "characteristic of") + "-est" (superlative suffix).  The word "drug" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately tracing back to Old French and Dutch words related to dried herbs used in medicine.
