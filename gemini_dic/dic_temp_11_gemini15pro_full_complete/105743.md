ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "kipper" + "-er" (agent suffix) + "-s" (plural suffix). "Kipper" itself comes from the Old English "kippian," meaning "to spawn," referring originally to salmon that were ready to spawn and thus preserved.  来源于动词 "kipper" 加上 "-er"（表示行为者的后缀）再加上 "-s"（复数后缀）。"Kipper" 本身来自古英语 "kippian"，意思是“产卵”，最初指的是准备产卵并因此被保存下来的鲑鱼。
