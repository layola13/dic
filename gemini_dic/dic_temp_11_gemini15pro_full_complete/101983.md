isochimal:/ˌaɪsəˈkaɪməl/ |adj.|等化学的，等价的|Having equal chemical value or composition.| The two solutions are isochimal, meaning they have the same chemical equivalence. 这两种溶液是等化学的，意味着它们具有相同的化学当量。| synonym:  equivalent, equimolar | antonym:  none | adjective

Etymology:  From Greek "iso-" (equal) + "chimal" (relating to chemical value).  The term "chimal" isn't a standalone English word but is derived from the Greek word for "juice" or "humour," reflecting an older understanding of chemical properties. 词源：来自希腊语“iso-”（相等）+“chimal”（与化学值有关）。 “chimal”一词不是独立的英语单词，而是源自希腊语中的“汁液”或“体液”，反映了对化学性质的较早理解。
