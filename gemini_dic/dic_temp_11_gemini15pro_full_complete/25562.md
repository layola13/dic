词源：The etymology of "bum" is complex and uncertain. One theory suggests it originates from German "Bummler" (loafer). Another proposes a link to "bummer," referring to worthless things, which might be connected to "boom," meaning a sudden rise, then a sudden fall.


注意事项: "Bum" can be considered offensive, especially when referring to a homeless person.  Use with caution.
