ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *abracadabra*, perhaps from Aramaic אברא כדברא ’avra k’davra “I will create as I speak”.  Another theory suggests it comes from the Hebrew phrase עַבְדָא כְּדַבְּרָא‎ (‘avda k’davra), meaning “I will create like the word.”  A third possibility is its derivation from Abraxas, a Gnostic deity.
