brachypinacoid:/brækiˈpɪnəkɔɪd/| n. |短柱面|A crystal form consisting of two parallel faces symmetrical about a plane of symmetry and parallel to the brachy axis (the shortest lateral axis) and the vertical axis.|Example: The brachypinacoid is a prominent feature of this mineral specimen.  这块矿物标本的短柱面很突出。

Example:  The brachypinacoid can be easily identified by its characteristic shape. 短柱面可以通过其特有的形状轻松识别。|近义词: (No direct synonym, as it's a specific crystallographic term.  Could consider related terms like "face," "plane," or perhaps "pinacoid" in a broader sense.)|反义词: None|词性: Noun
