词源: From Old English "tīd" (time) and  influenced by Middle English "houres," plural of "hour" from Old French "hore" ultimately from Latin "hora." The "-est" ending is a superlative suffix, although its use in "hourest" doesn't indicate a true superlative meaning, likely arising from dialectal variation or a misinterpretation.
