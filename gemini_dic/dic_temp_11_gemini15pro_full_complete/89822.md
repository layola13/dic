注意事项:  This word is not commonly used and is often replaced by "horn." You'll generally only encounter it in very specific contexts related to zoology or specialized studies of animal anatomy.  While technically correct, using "hornel" in everyday conversation might sound unusual or overly formal.  Stick to "horn" for general use.
