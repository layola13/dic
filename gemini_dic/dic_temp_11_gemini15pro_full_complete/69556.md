ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fēolagscipe ("fellowship, partnership, community, company"), from fēolaga ("partner, shareholder, colleague") + -scipe ("-ship").  The word fēolaga is a compound of fēo ("property, cattle") + laga ("one who lays down, one who places").  Therefore, the original meaning referred to a group of people who pooled their resources together.
