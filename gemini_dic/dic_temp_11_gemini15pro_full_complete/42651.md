Etymology:
From "counter-" (against, opposite) + "spell" (a magical formula or incantation).  "Counter-" comes from the Old French "contre-" and ultimately from the Latin "contra" (against). "Spell" comes from Old English "spell" (story, tale, discourse), later developing the meaning of a magical incantation.
