mansam is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, a word from another language, or even a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.

However, if you meant "manse," I can provide the following analysis:

manse: /mæns/ | n. | 牧师住宅；大而堂皇的住宅 | A large and impressive house, especially a minister's residence. | Example: The minister and his family lived in the manse next to the church. 牧师和他的家人住在教堂旁的牧师住宅里。| Example:  The old Victorian mansion was referred to as the "manse" by the locals, although it had never housed a clergyman.  当地人把那座古老的维多利亚式豪宅称为“牧师住宅”，尽管它从未住过神职人员。 | Synonym: residence, house, parsonage, vicarage | Antonym: (No direct antonym, but perhaps) hovel, shack | Noun
