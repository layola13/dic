词源: From the Latin word "infans" meaning "unable to speak," hence "baby, young child."  The suffix "-ize" (or "-ise") turns it into a verb meaning "to make or render infantile."  The "-ing" suffix creates the present participle form of the verb, and "-ed" creates the past participle form, which can function as an adjective.
