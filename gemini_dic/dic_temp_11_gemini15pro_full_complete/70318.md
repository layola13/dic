ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *fief*, *feif* "fief, fee," from Frankish *fehu* "cattle, property," from Proto-Germanic *fehu* "cattle, wealth," from PIE *peku- "movable wealth, livestock."  The word originally referred to movable property, especially cattle, which was a primary measure of wealth in early Germanic societies.  Later, it came to mean land granted in exchange for service, especially military service, under the feudal system.  The original sense of "cattle" is preserved in the modern English word "fee," which originally meant payment, often in the form of livestock.
