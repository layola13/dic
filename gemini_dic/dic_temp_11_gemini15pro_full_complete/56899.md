注意事项:
"Dost" is considered highly archaic and is not used in modern English. Its usage is confined to historical texts, particularly the King James Version of the Bible, and some forms of poetry attempting to evoke an older style.  It is the second person singular, informal, objective form, equivalent to "thee" as an object. The subjective form is "thou."  Modern English uses "you" for both subject and object, singular and plural, formal and informal.
