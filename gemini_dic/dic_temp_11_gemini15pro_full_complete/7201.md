angle-dip:/ˈæŋɡəl dɪp/ | n. | 角倾斜,倾角 |The angle of dip is the angle that a geological formation makes with the horizontal. | The geologist measured the angle-dip of the rock strata. 地质学家测量了岩层的倾角。 |  inclination, dip angle | ascent, rise | noun

Etymology:  "angle" (from Old French "angle," from Latin "angulus," meaning "corner") + "dip" (from Old English "dyppan," meaning "to immerse, plunge").  The combined term refers to the angle of inclination downwards.
