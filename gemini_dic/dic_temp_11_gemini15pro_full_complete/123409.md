monophyletic:/ˌmɒnəfaɪˈletɪk/ |adj.|单系的|Descended from a common evolutionary ancestor or ancestral group, especially one not shared with any other group.|Birds are a monophyletic group because they all share a common ancestor that is not the ancestor of any other group.|近义词:holophyletic|反义词:paraphyletic, polyphyletic|词性:形容词
Etymology: From Ancient Greek mónos (“single, alone”) + phylé (“tribe, clan”) + -etic (forming adjectives from nouns)
