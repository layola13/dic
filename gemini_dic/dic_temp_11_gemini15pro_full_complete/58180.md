词源:
From Old English *druncnian, from Proto-Germanic *drunknōną (“to become drunk, drown”), from Proto-Indo-European *dhreugh- (“to disturb, make muddy”). Cognate with Dutch dronken (“drunk”), German trunken (“drunk”). The original sense was "to be overwhelmed (by liquid)," which led to both the literal sense "drown" and the figurative one "make very drunk."
