PHRASE->
(This word is not typically used in common phrases.  It's more of a descriptive adverb.)


词源:
From enlighten + -ed + -ly.  Enlighten comes from en- (meaning "to cause to be") + light (referring to knowledge or understanding).  Therefore, enlightened means "brought into the light" or "given understanding."  The suffix -ly turns the adjective enlightened into an adverb.
