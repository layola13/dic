"aob" is not a recognized English word. It's possible that it's a typo, an abbreviation, or a term used in a specific field.  Therefore, I can't provide a standard linguistic analysis for it.  

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered the term, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, I can still demonstrate the requested format using a common word like "what":
