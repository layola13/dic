ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "carry off," composed of "carry" (from Middle English carien, from Old North French carier, from Late Latin carricare, of uncertain origin) and "off" (from Old English of, af, meaning "away from, off"). The noun sense developed later, likely from the idea of water being carried off.
