overreduced:/ˌōvər-rɪˈdjuːst/ | adj. | 过度还原的；过度简化的 |  (Chemistry) Reduced beyond a certain point, especially beyond the normal or desired state. In biology, it refers to a metabolic state where an organism or cell has an excess of reducing equivalents (like NADH or NADPH) relative to oxidized equivalents (like NAD+ or NADP+). This can disrupt metabolic pathways and lead to the accumulation of potentially harmful byproducts. | The overreduced environment inhibited enzyme activity. 过度还原的环境抑制了酶的活性。 | The overreduced state of the cell led to the accumulation of lactate. 细胞的过度还原状态导致了乳酸的积累。 | 近义词: over-saturated, excessively reduced | 反义词: oxidized, under-reduced | 词性: 形容词
