##pixelizations:  详细解析ɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 像素化；像素分解 |  像素化是指图像或视频被分解成一个个独立的像素点，从而降低图像质量，使其显得粗糙模糊的过程。尤其在放大图像或视频时，这种效果更加明显。这通常是由图像压缩、低分辨率或图像处理过程中数据丢失造成的。 |  Theimage showed severe pixelizations when enlarged.  (放大后，图像出现了严重的像素化。)  The video suffered from noticeable pixelizations due to low bitrate encoding. (由于低码率编码，视频出现了明显的像素化。) |  pixelation, granulation |  high-resolution, smoothness" suffix indicates a process or action.  Therefore, "pixelization" literally refers to the process of becoming composed of or represented by pixels.  The term's evolution reflects the growing importance of digital imagery and its inherent limitations in representing continuous real-world scenes. The increasing use of digital media, from earlycomputer graphics to modern high-definition video, has cemented "pixelization" as a common term to describe a specific visual artifact.both technical and informal contexts. In technical contexts, it might be discussed in relation to image compression algorithms, video encoding standards, or image processing techniques. In informal contexts, it might simply describe a picture or video that appears blurry or blocky."The high compression rate resulted in unacceptable levels of pixelization in the final output." (高压缩率导致最终输出的像素化程度无法接受)复古的像素艺术效果)While "pixelation" is the most direct synonym, terms like "blockiness," "grainy," and  "jaggedness" can sometimes capture aspects of the visual effect of pixelization, depending on the context.  "Granulation" might also be used if referring to a finer-grained texture.general phenomenon or a specific instance.  The plural ("pixelizations") is less common and is primarily used to refer to multiple instances of pixelization, possibly in different parts of an image or at different times in a video. For example, one might say "The image exhibited several distinct pixelizationscaused by artifacts in the source data." (图像表现出几种不同的像素化，是由源数据中的伪影造成的。)
