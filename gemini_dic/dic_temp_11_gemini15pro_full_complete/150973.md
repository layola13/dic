In its geometric origins, it referred to a line or length measured alongside another.  Over time, its meaning has evolved to encompass a variable in a mathematical equation ora statistical model.ize" is primarily used in mathematics, computer science, and related fields. It signifies the process of expressing something (often a curve, surface, or other geometric object, or a set of equations) in terms of parameters.  These parameters are independent variables that define or control the features of the object or equation being described.sin(t)$points or parameter values, which can be adjusted to alter the object's appearance.is a key task in model training..  For example,  a function to draw a rectangle might take parameters for the length, width, and color.$(x_0, y_0)$ is a point on the line and $a$ and $b$ are parameters.线上的一个点，$a$和$b$是参数。了形状。
