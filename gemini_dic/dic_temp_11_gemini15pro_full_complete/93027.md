词源：From Old French *idiote (Modern French idiot) and directly from Latin idiota “ordinary person, layman,” also “uneducated or ignorant person,” later “fool” (in Late Latin), from Greek idiotes “private person (as opposed to one taking part in public affairs), layman, common person, ignorant, illiterate person,” literally “private, one’s own.”  The original sense was “a private citizen” (as distinct from someone holding public office), hence “one lacking professional skill,” and finally “a simpleton.”
