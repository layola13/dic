词源:
"Bros" is a shortened, informal form of "brothers."  The addition of -'s indicates possession, similar to how we add -'s to singular nouns.  While grammatically "brothers'" is the standard possessive form, "bros's" reflects colloquial usage and is increasingly common, especially in online communication.
