ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "dash," meaning to move quickly and suddenly. The "off" particle adds the sense of completion and departure.  "Dash" itself originates from a Scandinavian source, likely Old Norse "daska" meaning to strike or slap.  The sense of rapid movement likely evolved from the idea of a sudden, forceful action.
