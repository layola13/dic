lyopomata: /ˌlaɪoʊˈpoʊmətə/ | n. | 冻干物，冻干制品 | Lyophilized materials, usually biological samples, preserved by freeze-drying. | The lyopomata were stored at -80°C for future analysis. 这些冻干物被储存在-80°C以备将来分析。|  The scientist carefully reconstituted the lyopomata. 科学家小心地将冻干制品复水。 | synonyms: freeze-dried material, lyophilized sample | antonyms: N/A | noun


Etymology:  From lyo- (meaning "to loosen, dissolve," from Greek "lyein") + -pomata (plural of -poma, meaning "something drunk or swallowed").  Ultimately relates to the process of freeze-drying, where ice is removed from a substance by sublimation, leaving a dry, easily reconstituted product.
