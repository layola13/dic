kHz:/ˈkɪləhɜːrts/ /ˈkɪləhɝːts/| n. |千赫兹|kilohertz, a unit of frequency equal to 1,000 hertz (cycles per second).  It is used to measure the frequency of radio waves, sound waves, and other oscillations.|The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 kHz.|近义词:kilocycles per second (kc/s)|反义词: (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement)|abbr.
