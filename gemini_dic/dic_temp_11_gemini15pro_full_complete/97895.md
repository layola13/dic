注意事项:

"Innermostly" is not a standard English word. It's a relatively recent coinage and is not commonly used.  While understandable, it might be considered informal or even poetic. Using more common synonyms like "inwardly," "deep down," or "at heart" would generally be preferred in formal writing.
