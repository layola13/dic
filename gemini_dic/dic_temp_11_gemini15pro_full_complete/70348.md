词源:

From the verb "fiend," meaning "to act like a fiend," which in turn comes from the Old English "fēond" meaning "enemy," "devil," or "Satan."  The modern sense of craving developed in the late 19th century, likely influenced by the imagery of a fiend or demon possessing someone and driving them to insatiable desires.
