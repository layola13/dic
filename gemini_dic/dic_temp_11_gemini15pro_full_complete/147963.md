Etymology:
From over- + resoluteness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Resoluteness" comes from the Late Middle English "resolut," from Latin "resolutus," past participle of "resolvere" meaning "to loosen, dissolve, resolve."  Therefore, "overresoluteness" literally means an excessive state of being resolved or determined.
