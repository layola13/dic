entropy: /ˈentrəpi/ | n. | 熵; 混乱; 无序 | A thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system.  Also used more generally to refer to a state of disorder, chaos, or uncertainty. | The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum. 宇宙的熵趋于最大值。|  The room was in a state of complete entropy. 房间里一片混乱。 | synonyms: disorder, chaos, randomness, disorganization | antonyms: order, organization, structure | noun
