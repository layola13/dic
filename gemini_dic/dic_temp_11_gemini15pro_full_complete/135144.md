The word "nonoilier" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "non-oilier" or are curious about constructing a word with this prefix and suffix, I can offer some insights.

Let's assume you meant **non-oilier**, which would be an adjective.

non-oilier:/nɒnˈɔɪlɪər/ | adj. | 不那么油腻的 | Less oily; containing or exhibiting less oil. |  This lotion is non-oilier than the previous one.  这款乳液比上一款不那么油腻。| This recipe calls for a non-oilier type of fish. 这个食谱需要一种不那么油腻的鱼。| synonyms: less greasy, less fatty | antonyms: oilier, greasier | adjective


**Etymology:**

* **non-**:  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "not," "lack of," or "opposite of."
* **oily**: Derived from "oil" + "-y" (suffix indicating having the qualities of).  "Oil" ultimately comes from the Old French "oile," from Latin "oleum."
* **-er**: A comparative suffix indicating a greater degree of a quality.  In this constructed context, "non-oilier" implies a *lesser* degree of oiliness.

**Usage (assuming "non-oilier"):**
