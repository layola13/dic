词源:  "dipstick" comes from the action of "dipping" a "stick" into something to measure it.  The word has been in use since the late 19th century, initially primarily for measuring oil levels. The informal meaning of "stupid person" emerged later, likely based on the perceived simplicity of using a dipstick.
