nonsynchronousnesses:/ˌnɑːnˈsɪŋkrənəsnəsɪz/ | n. | 非同步性；异步状态 | The state or quality of not being synchronous; lack of synchronization.  |  The nonsynchronousnesses of the data streams made analysis difficult.  数据流的非同步性使得分析变得困难。 |  asynchronies, non-simultaneity | synchronicity, simultaneity | noun

Etymology:
From non- (prefix meaning "not") + synchronous (adjective meaning "existing or occurring at the same time") + -ness (suffix forming nouns from adjectives).  The word "synchronous" ultimately derives from the Greek words "syn" (together) and "chronos" (time).
