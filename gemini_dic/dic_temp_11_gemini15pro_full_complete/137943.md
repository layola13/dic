词源: "Nonwars" is a neologism, a relatively new word formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the word "wars."  It gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as the nature of conflict evolved beyond traditional military engagements.  非战争是一个新词，由表示“非”的前缀“non-”和单词“wars”组合而成。随着冲突的性质超越了传统的军事交战，它在20世纪末和21世纪初变得突出。
