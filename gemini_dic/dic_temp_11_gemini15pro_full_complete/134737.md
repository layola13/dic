nonmechanistic:/ˌnɒnˌmɛkəˈnɪstɪk/ | adj. | 非机械论的 | Not pertaining to or characteristic of a mechanism; not involving or explained by physical or chemical principles. |  The study suggests a nonmechanistic explanation for the phenomenon.  这项研究对这种现象提出了非机械的解释。 | Examples abound of nonmechanistic thinking in biology. 生物学中不乏非机械性思维的例子。| 近义词: non-physical, vitalistic, holistic | 反义词: mechanistic, physical, reductionist | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
non- (prefix): from Latin "non" meaning "not"
mechanistic (adjective): from mechanism + -istic (suffix forming adjectives). Mechanism ultimately derives from Greek "mēkhanē" meaning "machine, contrivance".
