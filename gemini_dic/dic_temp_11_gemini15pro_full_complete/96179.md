词源：in- (not) + desert (to abandon).  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "desert," creating a back-formation that implies the opposite of desertion.  While "desert" means to abandon, "indesert" means to *not* abandon or to return to supporting someone/something. This word is archaic and rarely used.  "Undesert" is a slightly more common, yet still archaic, synonym.
