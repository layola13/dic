词源: From Late Latin illustrator, from Latin illustrat-, past participle stem of illustrare "to light up, brighten, make clear," figuratively "to make illustrious, distinguish, make famous," from assimilated form of in- "in" + lustrare "to light up," from lustrum "purification," from luere "to wash, atone for, purify."  (来自晚期拉丁语 illustrator，源自拉丁语 illustrat-，illustare 的过去分词词干，意为“点亮、照亮、使清晰”，比喻义为“使杰出、区分、使著名”，来自 in- 的同化形式，意为“在……中” + lustrare “点亮”，源自 lustrum “净化”，来自 luere “清洗、赎罪、净化”。)
