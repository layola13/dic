PHRASE->

(Since "exer" is a prefix and not a standalone word, it doesn't form phrases in the same way as words like "what". Therefore, providing phrases in the same way as the example is not possible.  Instead, I'm providing examples of words that use "exer-" as a prefix.)

1. exergonic reaction 放能反应
2. exergonic process 放能过程
3. exert pressure 施加压力
4. exert force 施加力
5. exert influence 施加影响


注意事项:

Since "exer-" is a prefix, it does not have independent stress or pronunciation. Its pronunciation is influenced by the word it is attached to.  Therefore, the pronunciation provided is a general approximation.


As "exer-" is a prefix, it doesn't have synonyms or antonyms in the same way a full word does.  The closest equivalent might be the prefix "ex-," which also signifies "out of" or "from."


"Exer-" is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in chemistry and physics.
