Etymology:
From imposing + -ness + -'s.  "Imposing" comes from the Old French "imposer" (to impose),  which in turn derives from the Latin "imponere" (to place upon).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. The final -'s indicates possession, specifically of the quality of imposingness.
