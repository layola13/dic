calmest:/ˈkɑːməst/ | adj. | 最平静的；最镇定的 |  Superlative form of calm: most calm.  | The lake was calmest in the early morning.  清晨的湖面最为平静。 | 近义词: most peaceful, most tranquil, most serene | 反义词: most agitated, most turbulent, most frantic | 词性: 形容词

词源: From Middle English *calme, from Old North French calme, caume (“calm weather”), from Late Latin cauma (“burning heat of the sun; midday heat; midday rest”), from Ancient Greek καῦμα (kaûma, “heat, burning heat”).  The semantic shift from "heat" to "calm" is probably due to the stillness of the air during the hottest part of the day.
