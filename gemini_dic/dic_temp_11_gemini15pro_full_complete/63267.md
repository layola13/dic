From Late Latin enthusiasmus, from Greek enthousiasmos, from enthous "inspired, possessed by a god," from en- "in" + theos "god."  Originally in English, as in Greek, it meant "possession by a divine spirit, prophetic or poetic frenzy." The meaning "intense enjoyment of something" is first recorded in the early 17th century.
