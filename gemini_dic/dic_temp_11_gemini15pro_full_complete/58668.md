dummador: /ˌdʌməˈdɔːr/ (This pronunciation is a reasoned guess, as "dummador" isn't a recognized English word.) | n. | 笨蛋; 傻瓜 (This definition is conjectural based on the likely etymology.) | This word likely doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a constructed word, possibly borrowing from "dumb" (stupid) and adding a suffix like "-ador" (one who...).  It could be interpreted as "one who is dumb." |  (No verifiable example sentences exist.)  Example (constructed): "He acted like a complete dummador, forgetting his own keys." 他表现得像个十足的笨蛋，竟然忘了自己的钥匙。| Near synonyms: idiot, fool, moron, dolt, simpleton | Antonyms: genius, intellect, savant | noun
