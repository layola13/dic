ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + amenable + -ity.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Amenable" comes from Old French "amenable" meaning "liable to be brought before a court," from Medieval Latin "amenabilis," from Latin "a-" (to) + "mener" (to lead). "-ity" is a suffix forming nouns of quality or state.  因此，"nonamenability" 表示“不顺从，不服从管理的状态”。
