Etymology:
From Late Latin inconsistentia, from inconsistent- (stem of inconsistens) + -ia.  Inconsistent is from in- "not" + consistent. Consistent comes from Latin consistentem (nominative consistens) "standing firm, consistent," present participle of consistere "to stand still, take a stand; exist, subsist," from con- "together" + sistere "to cause to stand, place, set," from PIE root *sta- "to stand, make or be firm."
