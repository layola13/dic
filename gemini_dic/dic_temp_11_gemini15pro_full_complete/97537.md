PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's more of a formal academic term.)

Etymology:  From "ingrained" + "-ness".  "Ingrained" comes from "in-" (meaning "in, into, within") + "grain" (originally referring to the dyeing of fabric, where the color penetrates deeply into the grain of the material).  Thus, "ingrained" refers to something deeply embedded or fixed. The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition.
