From dis- (expressing negation) + incentivize (from incentive, from Latin incentivus "inciting, setting the tune," from incentus, past participle of incinere "to set the tune," from in- "in" + canere "to sing").  The suffix -ize forms verbs. The -ing suffix makes it a present participle, usable as an adjective or in continuous verb tenses.
