baculometry:/ˌbækjʊˈlɒmətri/
n.|杆状病毒测定法|The study of rod-shaped viruses (baculoviruses), especially for insect control.  This often involves measuring virus concentration or assessing their effects on insect populations.|Baculometry is a crucial tool in developing effective biopesticides.|近义词:virology (in a broader sense), bioassay|反义词: N/A|词性:noun
Etymology:  From baculo- (rod-shaped) + -metry (measurement).  "Baculo-" ultimately derives from Latin "baculum" (stick, staff). "-metry" comes from Greek "-metria" (measurement).
