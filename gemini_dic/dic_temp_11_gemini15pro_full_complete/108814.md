词源：Old English *lēfan (unattested), from West Germanic *laubjaną (cf. Old Saxon farlēbian “to leave remaining,” Old Frisian lēva “to allow,” Dutch lijven “to live,” Old High German līban “to live, remain”), from Proto-Germanic *laubijaną, from PIE root *leip- “to stick, adhere.”  The sense evolution in Germanic seems to have been from “remain, be left” to “cause to remain” to “depart, leave.”
