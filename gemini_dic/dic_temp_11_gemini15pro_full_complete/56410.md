dolichocephaly:/ˌdɒlɪkəˈsɛfəli/ | n. | 长头畸形 | A condition in which the head is longer than usual, relative to its width.  It is characterized by a cephalic index (the ratio of the maximum width of the head to its maximum length) of less than 75. |  Dolichocephaly can be a normal variation, but it can also be associated with certain genetic disorders. 长头畸形可以是一种正常变异，但也可能与某些遗传疾病有关。| Example: The archaeologist noted the dolichocephaly evident in the skull. 考古学家注意到头骨明显的长头畸形。
| Example:  Dolichocephaly is sometimes seen in premature infants.  早产儿有时会出现长头畸形。 | Synonym: long-headedness | Antonym: brachycephaly | Noun
