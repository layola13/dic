Etymology:
From "guarded" + "-ness".  "Guarded" comes from the verb "guard," which originated from the Old French word "garder" meaning "to keep, protect, watch over," ultimately from the Frankish "*wardon," related to the Old High German "warton" (to watch).  The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
