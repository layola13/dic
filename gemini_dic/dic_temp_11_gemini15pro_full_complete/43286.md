ETYMOLOGY->
From craftsperson + 's (possessive suffix).  "Craftsperson" itself is a more gender-neutral term formed by combining "craft" and "person." "Craft" comes from Old English cræft, meaning "strength, skill, art," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *kraftiz. "Person" comes from Old French persone and Latin persona, meaning "mask, character, person."
