PHRASE->

(Since "mme" is a title, it doesn't typically form phrases in the same way words like "what" do.  It's primarily used preceding a surname.)  Therefore, providing phrases directly related to "Mme." is not applicable.  Instead, here are examples of how it is used in context:

Addressing in a formal letter:  Dear Mme.  Le Pen,  亲爱的勒庞夫人，
Introducing someone:  This is Mme.  Toussaint.  这位是图森夫人。
Referring to someone:  Mme.  Mitterrand arrived early.  密特朗夫人来得早。
On a nameplate:  Mme.  Chirac  希拉克夫人
In a formal announcement:  Mme.  Sarkozy will be attending.  萨科齐夫人将出席。


注意事项:
"Mme." is an abbreviation and is always followed by a period.
It is generally used in formal contexts.
While "mme" is the standard abbreviation, "mdme" is also sometimes seen, although less common.
