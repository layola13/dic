注意事项:

"Consentant" is an older, less common word compared to "consenting." While grammatically correct,  using synonyms like "agreeing," "concordant," or "harmonious" is often preferable in modern English, depending on the specific context. For the noun form, "one who consents," using "approver" or "assenter" is more common and readily understood.
