While "ochred" isn't commonly used in phrases, its root word "ochre" can be found in phrases like "ochre robes" (referring to the robes worn by Buddhist monks) or "red ochre" (specifying a particular shade of the pigment).  Since "ochred" functions primarily as a past participle or adjective, it doesn't readily form standalone phrases in the same way nouns or verbs might.
