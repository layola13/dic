Etymology:
From Middle English *linche, *lynche, from Old English *lynċe (“linchpin”), from Proto-Germanic *lunkiją (“bend, curve”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)lenk- (“to bend, turn”). Cognate with Old High German lunka (“loop, eye, link”), Middle Dutch lonke (“ring, curl”), German Lunke (“indirect hint”).  The meaning shifted from "linchpin" (a pin used to secure a wheel on an axle) to "latch" probably by association with the bar used to secure a gate.
