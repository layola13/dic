homomorphism:/ˌhɒməˈmɔːfɪzəm/ (US) /ˌhoʊməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同态|A mapping between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces) that preserves the operations of the structures.  In simpler terms, it's a structure-preserving map.  For example, a homomorphism between groups preserves the group operation. |The homomorphism from the integers to the integers modulo n takes each integer to its remainder after division by n.  整数到模n整数的同态将每个整数映射到它除以n后的余数。

A homomorphism between two groups maps the identity element of the first group to the identity element of the second group. 两个群之间的同态将第一个群的单位元映射到第二个群的单位元。|近义词：morphism, mapping, function|反义词: N/A |词性: noun
