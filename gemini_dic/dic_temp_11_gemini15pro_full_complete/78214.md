注意事项:  Since "Geraldi" is a proper noun (a surname), its usage is limited to identifying a person. It doesn't have the same range of grammatical functions as common nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  Therefore, some of the grammatical examples above are slightly contrived to illustrate the tenses, but they may not be typical usage in natural conversation.
