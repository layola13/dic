associativity:/əˌsoʊʃiˈeɪtɪvɪti/ | n. |结合性，结合律|The property of an operation whereby the result of applying the operation to a sequence of operands is independent of the grouping of the operands.  In other words, the order in which operations of the same precedence are performed does not matter. |Example 1: Addition and multiplication have associativity. (加法和乘法具有结合性。)
Example 2:  Subtraction does not have associativity. (减法不具有结合性。)|Near Synonyms:  combinativity,  grouping property |Antonyms: non-associativity|Noun
