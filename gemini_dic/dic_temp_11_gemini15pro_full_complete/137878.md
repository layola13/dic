nonviscidness:/ˌnɒnvɪsˈkɪdnəs/ |n.|无粘性，不粘稠|The nonviscidness of the liquid allowed it to flow easily through the narrow pipe.  这种液体的无粘性使它很容易流过狭窄的管道。|例句：The nonviscidness of the oil is crucial for its use in high-speed machinery.  这种油的无粘性对其在高速机械中的使用至关重要。|近义词：inviscidity, fluidity|反义词：viscosity, stickiness|词性:名词

Etymology->
From non- (prefix meaning "not") + viscid (meaning "sticky, glutinous") + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality).  Viscid ultimately comes from Latin viscum ("birdlime," a sticky substance used to catch birds).
