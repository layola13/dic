federis:/ˈfɛdɛrɪs/
n.
federations (plural)
联盟，联邦
This word appears to be a mistaken or archaic plural form of "federis," likely intended as "foederis," the genitive singular of the Latin word "foedus," meaning "treaty," "pact," "league," or "covenant."  The correct plural of "foedus" is "foedera."  "Federis" itself does not exist as a standalone word in classical Latin.  In modern contexts, the word "federation" (plural "federations") is used to describe a union of states or organizations.
Example:  The articles of the federis between the two nations guaranteed peace. (This is incorrect Latin.  A correct example using "foederis" would be:  "Condiciones foederis inter duas nationes pacem confirmaverunt." - The conditions of the treaty between the two nations confirmed the peace.)
近义词:league, alliance, union, confederation
反义词:division, separation, disunity
词性:Noun (incorrectly formed, likely intended as genitive singular of a Latin noun)
