heterotherm: /ˈhetərəˌθɜːrm/ | n. | 变温动物 | An animal whose body temperature varies with its surroundings.  | Example 1: Bats are heterotherms, allowing their body temperature to drop during periods of inactivity. 例1：蝙蝠是变温动物，在不活动期间体温会下降。

Example 2: Many desert animals are heterotherms, adapting their body temperature to the extreme conditions. 例2：许多沙漠动物是变温动物，它们的体温会适应极端条件。 | Near Synonyms: poikilotherm, ectotherm | Antonyms: homeotherm, endotherm | noun


Etymology: From Greek *heteros* "other, different" + *thermē* "heat"
