azimoff: /ˈæzɪmɒf/ (US) /ˈæzɪmɔːf/ (UK)| n.|方位角偏离; 磁方位角与真方位角之差|The azimoff is the difference between magnetic north and true north. 方位角偏离是磁北和真北之间的差值。|The ship's navigation system calculated the azimoff to be 3 degrees. 船舶导航系统计算出方位角偏离为3度。|近义词: magnetic declination, magnetic variation|反义词: N/A|noun

词源:  From the Russian word "азимут" (azimut), meaning "azimuth," combined with the English suffix "-off," indicating a deviation or difference. 源自俄语单词 "азимут" (azimut)，意思是“方位角”，加上英语后缀“-off”，表示偏差或差异。
