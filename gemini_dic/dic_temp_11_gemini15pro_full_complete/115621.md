词源：
From Old French *marchier "to walk, tread, trample," from Frankish *markon "to mark, mark out," from Proto-Germanic *markojanan "to mark, delimit," from PIE *merk- "boundary, border." The meaning shifted from "treading on a boundary" to "border territory," then to "military expedition to a border," and finally to "any journey on foot." The month March is named after Mars, the Roman god of war, because it was the time of year when military campaigns traditionally began.
