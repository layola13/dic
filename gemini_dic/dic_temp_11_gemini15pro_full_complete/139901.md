PHRASE->
This phrase, "oddness's," is not commonly used in set phrases.  The word "oddness" itself can be used in phrases like "the oddness of the situation" or "a sense of oddness." However, the possessive form with an additional "s" is grammatically correct but rarely used in common parlance.  It is more natural to rephrase sentences to avoid using "oddness's."  For example, instead of saying "The oddness's of the situation was palpable," one could say "The situation's oddness was palpable" or "The strangeness of the situation was palpable."
