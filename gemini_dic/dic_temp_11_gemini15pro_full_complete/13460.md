PHRASE->
(This word is not commonly used in phrases. Its archaic meaning makes it difficult to fit into modern conversational phrases. Therefore, I am providing phrases using the word "trip" itself, as they are more relevant and practical.)

trip over something = 被某物绊倒
trip the light fantastic = 跳舞
take a trip = 去旅行
a business trip = 出差
a guilt trip = 内疚感


注意事项:

“atrip”作为形容词表示“旅行中”的用法较少见，更多用于描述船只的状态。
