ETYMOLOGY->

The origin of "fob" as a noun referring to a small pocket or a small ornament is uncertain. It might be related to the German word "Fuppe," meaning "pocket." The verb "fob" meaning "to cheat" likely comes from the now obsolete word "fobbe," which referred to a small pocket or pouch.  It's thought that pickpockets might have used these pouches to steal, thus leading to the association with deception.
