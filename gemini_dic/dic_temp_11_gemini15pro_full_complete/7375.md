animalculism:/ˌænɪˈmælkjʊlɪzəm/
n.
精源论; 动物精子论
The belief that the male semen contains miniature preformed individuals that grow into a fetus inside the female.
Historically, animalculism was a theory of conception that held that the father provided the essential material for offspring, while the mother merely provided the environment for its growth.  This contrasted with ovist theories, which posited the opposite.
The 17th-century discovery of spermatozoa through microscopes led to widespread acceptance of animalculism.
preformationism, spermism
ovism
