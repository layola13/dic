jit:/dʒɪt/| n.|即时编译（Just-In-Time compilation）|A technique where the execution of computer code is delayed until it is actually needed, at which point it is compiled.  This contrasts with traditional compilation, where the entire program is compiled before execution.|The Java Virtual Machine uses a JIT compiler to improve performance.|近义词:dynamic compilation|反义词:ahead-of-time compilation|名词

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The JIT compiler translates bytecode into machine code. = JIT编译器将字节码翻译成机器码。
JIT compilation improves the performance of Java applications. = JIT编译提高了Java应用程序的性能。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The JVM is using the JIT compiler to execute this code. = JVM正在使用JIT编译器来执行这段代码。
The JIT compiler is converting bytecode into native instructions. = JIT编译器正在将字节码转换为本地指令。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The JIT compiler has improved the execution speed significantly. = JIT编译器显著提高了执行速度。
The JVM has used the JIT compiler for this method. = JVM已经对这个方法使用了JIT编译器。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The JIT compiler has been optimizing this code for a while. = JIT编译器已经优化这段代码一段时间了。
The JVM has been using the JIT compiler since it started. = 自启动以来，JVM一直在使用JIT编译器。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The JIT compiler translated the bytecode quickly. = JIT编译器快速地翻译了字节码。
The JIT compiler improved the performance of the application. = JIT编译器提高了应用程序的性能。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The JIT compiler was optimizing the code when the error occurred. = 当错误发生时，JIT编译器正在优化代码。
The JVM was using the JIT compiler to execute the method. = JVM正在使用JIT编译器执行该方法。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The JIT compiler had already translated the bytecode before the execution. = 在执行之前，JIT编译器已经翻译了字节码。
The JVM had used the JIT compiler for several methods. = JVM已经对几个方法使用了JIT编译器。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The JIT compiler had been optimizing the code for hours before the issue was resolved. = 在问题解决之前，JIT编译器已经优化了代码几个小时。
The JVM had been using the JIT compiler since the application started. = 自应用程序启动以来，JVM一直在使用JIT编译器。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The JIT compiler will translate the bytecode when it's needed. = JIT编译器将在需要时翻译字节码。
The JIT compiler will improve the performance of the application over time. = JIT编译器将随着时间的推移提高应用程序的性能。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The JIT compiler will be optimizing the code during execution. = JIT编译器将在执行期间优化代码。
The JVM will be using the JIT compiler to improve performance. = JVM将使用JIT编译器来提高性能。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the process, the JIT compiler will have translated all the necessary bytecode. = 到流程结束时，JIT编译器将翻译所有必要的字节码。
The JVM will have used the JIT compiler extensively by the time the application finishes. = 当应用程序完成时，JVM将已经广泛地使用了JIT编译器。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
