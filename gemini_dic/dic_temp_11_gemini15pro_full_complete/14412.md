autotransformer:/ˌɔːtəʊˈtrænsˌfɔːmə(r)/ (US) /ˌɔːt̬oʊˈtrænsˌfɔːrmər/| n. |自耦变压器|An electrical transformer in which the primary and secondary windings are electrically connected, allowing for a smaller and lighter design compared to a conventional transformer with separate windings.  It achieves voltage transformation through a single winding with multiple taps.|The autotransformer is commonly used in applications requiring variable voltage control.|Synonyms: variable transformer, variac|Antonyms: isolation transformer|noun

autotransformer:/ˌɔːtəʊˈtrænsˌfɔːmə(r)/ (US) /ˌɔːt̬oʊˈtrænsˌfɔːrmər/| n. |自耦变压器|An electrical transformer in which the primary and secondary windings share a common portion, resulting in a smaller and lighter design compared to a conventional transformer. It can be used for both step-up and step-down voltage conversion.|We used an autotransformer to adjust the voltage supplied to the motor.|Synonyms: variable voltage transformer|Antonyms: double-wound transformer|noun
