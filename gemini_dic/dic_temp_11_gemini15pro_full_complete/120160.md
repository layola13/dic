Etymology:
"mind-blowing" is a compound adjective formed from "mind" and "blowing." "Mind" refers to the mental faculties, and "blowing" is the present participle of "blow," which in this context figuratively means to overwhelm or amaze. The term likely originated in the late 20th century, possibly influenced by the psychedelic experiences of the 1960s and 70s, where altered states of consciousness could lead to feelings of astonishment and awe.
