##piston:  活塞| 活塞 |that moves back and forth inside a cylinder.  It's a crucial part of many machines, especially internal combustion engines, hydraulic systems, and pneumatic systems.The piston's movement is usually driven by pressure changes in the surrounding fluid (gas or liquid).  It converts pressure into linear motion or vice versa, playinga vital role in power generation and many other applications.  The design of a piston often involves rings (piston rings) to create a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall, minimizing leakage and friction.  Different materials are used for pistonsdepending on the application, including aluminum alloys, cast iron, steel, and even ceramics for high-temperature or high-pressure environments. The shape of the piston crown (the top surface) can also vary depending on the specific design requirements ofthe engine or machine it is in.活塞环导致引擎气缸漏气。words describing the opposite action might be relevant)the Middle French word  *piston*, which ultimately derives from the Latin word *pistillum*, meaning "pestle." This connection highlights the similarity in the basic up-and-down movement of a pestle in a mortar and a piston in a cylinder. The shift in meaning reflects the evolution of technology and theadoption of the word to describe a mechanical component.时 (Simple Present):**正在向上移动。same pistons.  这台引擎已经使用了相同的活塞十年了。一种新的活塞设计。was moving too fast when the failure occurred. 故障发生时，活塞移动得太快了。the mechanic arrived. 技工到达之前，引擎已经卡住了。几个小时了。The mechanic will install a new piston tomorrow. 技工明天将安装一个新的活塞。performance during the test. 工程师们将在测试期间监测活塞的性能。piston design by Friday. 团队将在星期五之前完成新的活塞设计测试。*  She will have been working on piston design improvements for two decades by then. 到那时，她将在活塞设计改进方面工作二十年了。
