The word "manaila" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a regionalism, slang, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you think it might mean, I may be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a name, I can help you with pronunciation. If it's from another language, I can try to identify the language and provide a translation.


However, I can still demonstrate the requested format using the word "what" as an example:

what: /wʌt/ /hwʌt/ | pron. determiner. adv. int. | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. |  What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | similar: which, how | opposite: (No direct opposite for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
