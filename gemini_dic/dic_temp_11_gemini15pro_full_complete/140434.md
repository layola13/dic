词源：okey-doke is a playful alteration of OK, first recorded in the 1930s.  OK itself has a complex and disputed etymology, with theories ranging from abbreviations of "oll korrect" (a humorous misspelling of "all correct") to derivations from West African languages.  The "-doke" suffix likely adds emphasis and a whimsical tone.
