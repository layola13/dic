PHRASE->
(No common phrases directly use "mores" as a keyword.  The word is typically used in formal contexts discussing societal norms and values. Therefore, providing phrases that include the word itself would be artificial and unhelpful. Instead, it is more useful to understand how it is used within sentences discussing cultural practices.)
