词源:  From the adjective "concerned" + "-ly" (adverbial suffix). "Concerned" comes from the past participle of the verb "concern," which originates from the Old French "concerner" and ultimately from the Latin "concernere" (to mix together, to sift).  The evolution of meaning suggests a shift from the idea of being mixed up in something to being emotionally invested and worried about it.
