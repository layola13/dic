注意事项:

"Hobbers" itself is a somewhat informal and less common term than "hobbyists".  While grammatically correct in the examples provided, using "hobbyist" is generally preferred in formal writing.  The verb form "to hob" or "hobbing," while understandable in context, is also less common than using phrases like "engaging in their hobby," "pursuing their hobby," or simply "doing their hobby."
