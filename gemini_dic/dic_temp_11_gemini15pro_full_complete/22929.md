词源:
"bott" (botfly larva) comes from Middle English *botte.  Its ultimate origin is uncertain, possibly related to a Germanic root meaning "to sting" or "to bite."

"bott" (robot) is a shortened form of "robot."  "Robot" itself comes from the Czech word "robota," meaning "forced labor," coined by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).
