dws:/ˌdʌbəljuːˈɛs/ | abbreviation | 深水波浪 | Deep-Water Waves.  These are waves that exist in water deeper than half their wavelength.  They don't interact with the bottom and have a more rounded shape. | The dws were particularly strong today, making surfing a challenge.  今天深水波浪特别强，使冲浪成为一项挑战。 | 近义词: ocean waves, swells | 反义词: ripples, shallow-water waves | n.
