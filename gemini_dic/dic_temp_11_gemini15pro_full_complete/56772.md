ETYMOLOGY->
From Dutch *doop* (sauce, gravy), related to *dippen* (to dip).  Originally referred to a thick syrup used in confectionery or to adulterate other substances.  The meaning broadened to include any mind-altering substance and later, figuratively, to inside information. The slang usage meaning "a stupid person" likely arose from the idea of someone being mentally dulled or slow.
