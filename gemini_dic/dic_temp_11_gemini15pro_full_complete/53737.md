discolith:/ˈdɪskəˌlɪθ/ | n. |盘石，圆盘状化石 |A discoidal calcareous body found in certain Cretaceous rocks, thought to be the remains of an alga.  A small, circular fossil, usually composed of calcium carbonate, found in some sedimentary rocks and believed to be the remains of a type of algae. |Example 1: Discoliths were found embedded in the chalk cliffs. 在白垩质悬崖中发现了盘石。

Example 2:  Researchers analyzed the discoliths to determine the age of the rock formation. 研究人员分析了盘石以确定岩层的年代。 |Synonym: coccolith (though not always interchangeable, as coccoliths are specifically from coccolithophores) |Antonym:  (No direct antonym exists for a specific fossil type.) |noun
