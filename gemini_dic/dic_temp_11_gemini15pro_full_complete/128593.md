注意事项: "niceness's" is grammatically correct, possessing the double possessive form, although  "niceness" is generally preferred and more commonly used.  The double possessive is usually employed with proper nouns,  e.g., "John's car's engine".  Using it with "niceness" adds a layer of emphasis on the specific quality belonging to someone or something, making it sound a bit more formal or even slightly unusual in everyday conversation.
