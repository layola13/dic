PHRASE->
This name doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases.  Since it's a proper noun, it's typically used as a subject or object in a sentence, rather than part of a fixed phrase.


注意事项:
As requested, no markdown formatting was used.  The word "Malena" primarily functions as a proper noun, and thus doesn't have synonyms or antonyms in the same way common nouns do.  It's possible for it to be used metaphorically, but those instances would be highly context-dependent.
