hooky's:/ˈhʊkiz/ | n. | 旷课，逃学（非正式） |  "Hooky" refers to the act of being absent from school or work without permission. The apostrophe and "s" added to the end makes it a possessive, but typically used informally to refer to a general instance of playing hooky rather than belonging to someone. It might be used in phrases like "playing hooky's" though this is grammatically less common and "playing hooky" is preferred. |  "He was caught playing hooky's and got detention." 他被抓到逃学，被留校了。 | 近义词: truancy, absenteeism | 反义词: attendance, presence | 词性: noun (informal, less common usage with possessive 's)

The origin of "hooky" is uncertain, but one theory suggests it comes from the Dutch word "hoekje" meaning "corner" or "hiding place," implying a place to hide from school or work.
