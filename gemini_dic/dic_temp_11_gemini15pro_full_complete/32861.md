cholinergic:/ˌkoʊlɪˈnɜːrdʒɪk/ | adj. n.|胆碱能的；胆碱能神经|Relating to or denoting nerve cells in which acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter.  Also, a substance that acts like acetylcholine.|例句：Cholinergic neurons are essential for muscle function. 胆碱能神经元对肌肉功能至关重要。

例句：The drug acts as a cholinergic agonist.  这种药物起胆碱能激动剂的作用。|近义词：acetylcholine-mediated|反义词：anticholinergic|词性:形容词, 名词


ETYMOLOGY->
From cholinergic (adj.) + -ic.  "Cholinergic" itself comes from choline (a nutrient essential for the synthesis of acetylcholine) + -ergic (meaning "working by" or "activated by"). Ultimately from Greek cholē (bile) + ergon (work).
