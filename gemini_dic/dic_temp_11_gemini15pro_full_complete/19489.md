ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *bīdan "to wait, remain, continue, dwell," from Proto-Germanic *bidaną "to compel, constrain, await" (source also of Old Saxon bidan, Old Frisian bidan, Old Norse bíða "to wait, await," Dutch beiden, German beiden "both," originally "the two waiting together"). The original sense was "to force to stay," hence "to stay, wait."
