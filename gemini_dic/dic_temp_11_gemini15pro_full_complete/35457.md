coacervation:/ˌkoʊæsərˈveɪʃən/ | n. |凝聚，凝聚作用；凝聚层|The process of forming droplets of a colloid, typically by adding another substance.  The resulting droplets are called coacervates.|Coacervation plays a crucial role in the origin of life theories. 凝聚在生命起源理论中起着至关重要的作用。| Coacervates can be used to encapsulate drugs for targeted delivery.  凝聚层可以用来包裹药物以进行靶向递送。 | aggregation, condensation | dispersion, dissolution | noun
