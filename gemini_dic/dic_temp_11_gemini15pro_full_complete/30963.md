chalazal:/kəˈleɪzəl/| adj.|合点端的，基部的|Relating to or situated at a chalaza, the basal part of an ovule where the integuments and nucellus are joined.|The chalazal end of the ovule is opposite the micropyle.|近义词:basal, proximal|反义词:apical, distal|词性:形容词

Etymology:
From Modern Latin *chalazalis*, from Latin *chalaza* "hailstone", referring to the appearance of the twisted cords in a bird's egg, ultimately from Greek *khálaza* "hailstone".
