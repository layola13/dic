neuroplasticity:/ˌnʊːroʊplæˈstɪsɪti/ /ˌnjʊərəʊplæˈstɪsɪti/| n. |神经可塑性|The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This allows the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust its activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.|Example 1:  Neuroplasticity allows the brain to recover from stroke. 神经可塑性使大脑能够从中风中恢复。

Example 2:  Researchers are studying the role of neuroplasticity in learning and memory. 研究人员正在研究神经可塑性在学习和记忆中的作用。|Synonyms: brain plasticity, neural plasticity|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but a concept related to reduced plasticity could be "neural rigidity" or "inflexibility")|noun
