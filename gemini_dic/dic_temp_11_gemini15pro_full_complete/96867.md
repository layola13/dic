ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + exhaustible.  "Exhaustible" comes from the Latin "exhaustus," the past participle of "exhaurire" meaning "to draw out completely, drain, empty."  Therefore, "inexhaustible" means "not able to be emptied."  The suffix "-ibility" transforms the adjective "inexhaustible" into the noun "inexhaustibility," denoting the state or quality of being inexhaustible.
