Etymology:
From Late Latin *homileticus*, from Greek homilētikos (“of or for conversation, social”), from homilein (“to converse, associate with”), from homilos (“assembly, crowd”).  The sense shifted from "conversational" to "pertaining to sermons" because homilies were originally informal talks or conversations.
