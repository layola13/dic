词源：coke (n.) "residue of coal after gases are driven off," 1708, from cole + -ock, a diminutive suffix.  The meaning "cocaine" is by shortening from coca-cola (1886), itself short for coca + kola nut, both ingredients of the original soft drink.  The adjectival meaning "under the influence of cocaine" is from 1986.
