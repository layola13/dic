inero:/ɪˈnɛroʊ/ | n. |  惯性;惰性 | In physics, inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity. This includes changes to the object's speed, or direction of motion. |  The inertia of the large truck made it difficult to stop quickly.  大卡车的惯性使其难以快速停止。| synonyms: momentum, inactivity, sluggishness | antonyms: activity, energy, liveliness | noun
