##plesiosaurus 的详细解析əˌsɔːrəs/ | n. | 蛇颈龙|**They were characterized by their long necks, small heads, and four large flippers. Fossil remains of plesiosaurs have been found across the globe, providingvaluable insights into the diversity and evolution of marine life during this period.  Various species of plesiosaurus existed, differing slightly in size and skeletal features. While commonly depicted with a very long neck, the neck length varied depending on the species.  They were likely powerful swimmers, using their flippers for propulsion. Their diet likely consisted of fish and other marine organisms. The exact lifestyle and social behavior of plesiosaurs remain topics of ongoing research and debate among paleontologists.积岩中被发现。as it's a specific extinct animal.)iosaurus" is primarily used in paleontological contexts.  It's a proper noun referring to a specific genus of extinct marine reptile, and should be capitalized.  It is seldom used outside of scientific discussions and educational materials about prehistoric life.though often unnatural, to use all tenses with a proper noun referring to an extinct creature.
