##oxygenant /ˈɒksɪdʒənənt/ | n.| 助燃剂；氧化剂 |that supplies oxygen or enables oxidation to occur.  Oxygenants are crucial in combustion reactions, providing the necessary oxygen for a fuel to burn. They can be invarious forms, including gaseous oxygen, oxidizing chemicals,  and even certain compounds that release oxygen during a reaction.  The properties of an oxygenant, such asits concentration and reactivity, significantly influence the rate and intensity of oxidation.气。oxidation.)The origin of "oxygen" itself traces back to the Greek words "oxys" (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "sour," and "genes" (γεννάω), meaning "to generate" or "to produce."  Lavoisier, who named oxygen, associated it withacids, believing that all acids contained oxygen. We now know this is not universally true.combustion, oxidation,  and the properties of materials used in such processes (e.g., rocket fuels, explosives). While "oxidizer" and "oxidizing agent" are often used interchangeably, "oxygenant" specifically highlights the provision of oxygen as the oxidizing mechanism.
