词性: adjective

词源:  "air" + "chambered". "Air" comes from Old English *ær, from Proto-Germanic *aira, from Proto-Indo-European *h₂éh₁r̥. "Chambered" is derived from "chamber", from Old French chambre, from Latin camera "vault, arched roof," from Greek kamara "anything with an arched cover," probably from PIE *kam- "to bend, curve."
