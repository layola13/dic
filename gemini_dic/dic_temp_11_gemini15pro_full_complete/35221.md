词源:  "Clue" originates from Old English *cliwen, meaning "ball of yarn," later referring to a thread that guides one through a labyrinth or mystery. "Clued-up" and "clued-in" are colloquial expressions that emerged in the 20th century, building on the idea of a clue providing necessary information or understanding.
