Etymology:
From Old French *coistreul, alteration of Old French questerel, from Vulgar Latin *quistrellus, diminutive of Latin cistarius "provision-box carrier," from cista "box, chest."  Originally referring to a groom or servant who carried the box of provisions for hawks, the term later became associated with untrained hawks themselves, and eventually with any young, inexperienced, or cowardly person.
