donies:/ˈdoʊniz/ | n. | 传闻；谣言；内幕消息 |  Things that are rumored or reported, often of a gossipy or unofficial nature. | The donies from the set suggest the movie will be a blockbuster.  来自片场的传闻暗示这部电影会很卖座。 | 近义词: rumors, gossip, reports, hearsay | 反义词: facts, truth, confirmation | 词性: 名词

词源: "Donies" likely originates from the verb "do," specifically its archaic past participle form "done."  "Donies" would have initially meant "things done" or "deeds," but over time, it evolved to mean "news of things done" or "reports." This is similar to the way "tidings" (from "tide," meaning "time" or "season") came to mean "news."
