词源:  From Ojibwe /ˈoːdʒɪbweː/, the autonym (name used by the people themselves).  The meaning is uncertain, with various interpretations proposed, including "to roast until puckered up" (referring to their moccasin-making techniques) and "those who cook until puckered," possibly referring to a method of cooking wild rice.  The variant "Chippewa" is derived from an early mispronunciation of Ojibwe.
