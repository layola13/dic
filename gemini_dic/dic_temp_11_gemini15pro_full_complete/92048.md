hyperphosphorylated: /ˌhaɪpərˈfɒsfərɪleɪtɪd/ /ˌhaɪpərˈfɑːsfərɪleɪtɪd/ | adj. | 过度磷酸化的 | Containing an excessive number of phosphate groups.  It describes a protein or other molecule that has been modified by the addition of multiple phosphate groups. This modification can significantly alter the molecule's function and is often involved in cellular regulation and signaling pathways. | The hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. 过度磷酸化的 tau 蛋白是阿尔茨海默病的一个标志。 |  Hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) loses its ability to regulate cell cycle progression. 过度磷酸化的视网膜母细胞瘤蛋白 (Rb) 失去了调节细胞周期进程的能力。 | overphosphorylated | hyophosphorylated | adjective
