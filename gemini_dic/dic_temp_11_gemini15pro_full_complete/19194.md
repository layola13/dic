ETYMOLOGY->
From bewitching + -ness.  Bewitching comes from bewitch, from be- + witch.  Be- is a prefix meaning "thoroughly," and witch comes from Old English *wicce, of uncertain origin. Ultimately related to Old High German *wih, meaning "holy." The shift in meaning from "holy" to "witch" likely occurred through association with pagan practices. -ness is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
