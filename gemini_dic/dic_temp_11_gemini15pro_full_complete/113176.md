词源:  "Lurch" comes from the Middle English "lurken," meaning "to lie hidden," later evolving to describe a sudden, awkward movement. "Line" likely refers to the direction or path of this movement, though the compound "lurchline" is a relatively recent formation and its etymology isn't definitively documented.  It likely arose by analogy with terms like "fault line" or "coastline," suggesting a boundary or path of instability.
