It aids in seed dispersal by wind.  | 例句：The dandelion seed has a fluffy pappus that helps it to spread in the wind.  蒲公英种子有一个蓬松的冠毛，有助于它随风传播。 The pappus of the thistle is composed of numerous fine bristles.蓟的冠毛由许多细小的刚毛组成。 | 近义词：coma, down, plume | 反义词：无  | 名词Latin word *pappus*, meaning "beard" or "down." This is highly descriptive of the often hairy or feathery appearance of the structure in question.  The Latin word itself might have roots in Proto-Indo-European, but the exact etymology beyond Latin is less certain and subject to scholarly debate.Its usage in botany to describe this specific plant part solidified over time.the Asteraceae (daisy) family. This structure is crucial for seed dispersal, allowing seeds to be carried by the wind over long distances. The characteristics of the pappus, such as its length, density, and structure, can be important in plant identification and classification.  The pappus can vary widely in appearance,from feathery plumes to stiff bristles, depending on the species. Scientists studying seed dispersal mechanisms often focus their attention on the pappus's role. The morphology of the pappus is often linked to the plants' evolutionary adaptation to their environment.on the air currents. 冠毛使种子能够漂浮在气流上。speed in the plant's habitat.  冠毛的大小与植物栖息地的风速有关。's meaning within its context.
