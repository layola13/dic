词源:  "Giffy" is likely a playful alteration of "gifted," suggesting someone naturally talented or skilled in a lighthearted way, often applied to clever remarks or amusing actions.  It can also be influenced by the popularity of "GIFs" (Graphics Interchange Format), short, looping animations often humorous or quirky.  There's no definitive etymological record for "giffy" in major dictionaries, suggesting it's a relatively recent, informal term.
