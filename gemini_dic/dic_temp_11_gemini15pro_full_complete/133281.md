nonexpansive:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænsɪv/
adjective
非扩张的
(of a function or mapping) having the property that the distance between the images of any two points in the domain is no greater than the distance between the points themselves.  In simpler terms, it means the function doesn't "stretch" or increase the distance between points.
The projection onto a closed convex set is nonexpansive.  投影到一个闭凸集上是非扩张的。
The function f(x) = x/2 is nonexpansive. 函数f(x) = x/2是非扩张的。
近义词:contractive (in some contexts)
反义词:expansive
