词源:  "Chairman" + "-ing" (present participle/gerund suffix). "Chairman" itself comes from "chair" (referring to the seat of authority) + "man".  While "chairperson" or "chair" are preferred in modern usage to avoid gendered language, "chairmanning" persists, although "chairing" is becoming increasingly common.
