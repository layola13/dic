词源:
"nonevadible" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the word "evadible".  "Evadible" itself comes from the verb "evade" (meaning "escape or avoid"), which has its roots in the Latin word "evadere,"  composed of "e-" (meaning "out") and "vadere" (meaning "to go").  Therefore, "nonevadible" literally means "not able to be gone out from" or "not able to be avoided."
