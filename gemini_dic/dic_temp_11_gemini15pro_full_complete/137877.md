nonviscidly:/nɒnˈvɪskɪdli/ | adv. | 非粘性地，无粘滞地 |  In a manner that is not viscous; without viscosity.  This describes the flow of a fluid that doesn't resist internal motion, meaning it flows very easily. | The lubricant allowed the gears to rotate nonviscidly. 润滑剂使齿轮能够无粘滞地旋转。 | The blood flowed nonviscidly through the artificial artery.  血液在人造动脉中无粘滞地流动。 | synonym: smoothly, fluidly | antonym: viscously, stickily | adverb
