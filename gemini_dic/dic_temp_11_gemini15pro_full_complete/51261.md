ETYMOLOGY->
de- (prefix): meaning "reverse" or "remove," from Latin
subsidize (verb): from Latin subsidium "assistance, aid," from sub- "under" + sedere "to sit" (meaning literally “troops stationed in reserve”).  The sense evolution was from "reserve troops" to "assistance" then to "monetary aid."
Thus, desubsidize literally means to "remove monetary aid."
