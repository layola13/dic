myceloid: /maɪˈsiːlɔɪd/
adjective|类菌丝体的，似菌丝体的|Resembling a mycelium; fungus-like. |The scientist discovered a myceloid growth under the microscope. 科学家在显微镜下发现了一种类似菌丝体的生长物。|Example 2: The myceloid structure of the organism made it difficult to classify.  该生物体类似菌丝体的结构使其难以分类。|近义词:fungal, fungoid|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "non-fungal")|词性:adjective
Etymology:  From "myceli-" (combining form of mycelium) + "-oid" (suffix meaning "resembling," "like").  "Mycelium" comes from the Greek "mykēs" (fungus).
