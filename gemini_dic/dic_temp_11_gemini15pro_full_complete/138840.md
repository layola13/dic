注意事项:

词源:  Nupson is likely a variant of "nincompoop," which has uncertain origins but is thought to be related to the obsolete word "ninny" (fool) and perhaps influenced by words like "poop" (fool) and "dummkopf" (German for "dumbhead").  Its usage is primarily informal and somewhat dated.  It's more common in some regional dialects.
