mis- (prefix):  meaning "wrong," "bad," or "incorrect."  源自古英语，意为“错误的”、“坏的”或“不正确的”。
consecrate (verb): from Latin consecratus, past participle of consecrare "to devote, dedicate," from com- "together" + sacrare "to make sacred," from sacer "sacred."  源自拉丁语 consecratus，consecrare 的过去分词，意为“奉献，献身”，由 com- “一起” + sacrare “使神圣”组成，源自 sacer “神圣的”。
