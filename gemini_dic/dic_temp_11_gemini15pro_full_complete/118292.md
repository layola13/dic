ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *Mercurialis*, from *Mercurius* (Mercury, the Roman god of commerce, travel, and thievery, known for his speed and eloquence), ultimately from *merx* (merchandise). The association with the metal mercury (also named after the god) likely stems from its fluidity and quick movement.
