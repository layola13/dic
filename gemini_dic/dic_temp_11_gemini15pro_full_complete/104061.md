jumart:/ˈdʒuːmɑːrt/ | n. | 杂交动物，通常指公牛和母马的杂交后代 | A hybrid animal, typically the offspring of a bull and a mare.  Although biologically possible, it's extremely rare due to the different number of chromosomes. |  Jumart offspring are extremely rare and usually sterile.  杂交后代非常罕见，通常是不育的。| Near synonyms: hybrid, crossbreed | Antonyms: purebred | Noun
