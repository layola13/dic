词源：From Old French *averie ("act of calculating the value of merchandise damaged at sea") from Italian avaria ("damage to ship or cargo"), from Arabic 'awar ("defect, blemish").  From the sense of distributing the cost of such damage proportionately across investors, it developed the senses of "assess proportionally" and later "calculate the mean".
