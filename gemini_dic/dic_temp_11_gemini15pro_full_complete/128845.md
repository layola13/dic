nigrification:/ˌnaɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 硝化作用 | The process by which ammonia is converted to nitrites and then to nitrates by bacteria in the soil. This is an important part of the nitrogen cycle, making nitrogen available to plants. | Example 1: Nigrification is essential for soil fertility. 硝化作用对土壤肥力至关重要。

Example 2: The rate of nigrification can be affected by temperature and pH. 硝化作用的速率会受到温度和pH值的影响。 | 近义词: nitritation (early stage) | 反义词: denitrification | 词性: noun
