词源:

The phrase "down at heel" (or "down at the heels") originates from the wear and tear visible on the heels of shoes. When someone's heels are worn down, it suggests they haven't been able to afford new shoes, implying poverty or neglect. This visual cue then extended metaphorically to describe a general state of shabbiness and decline.
