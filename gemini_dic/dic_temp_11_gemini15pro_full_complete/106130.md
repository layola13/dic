词源：
From Middle English *knigt, *knyght, *cniht, from Old English cniht (“boy, youth, attendant, servant, military follower”), from Proto-Germanic *kniχtaz (“boy, servant”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *(s)neh₁- (“to tie, to bind”). Cognate with Dutch knecht (“servant, farmhand”), German Knecht (“servant, bondsman, knave”), Danish knægt (“lad, boy”), Swedish knekt (“soldier, private”). Related also to Old English cnyttan (“to tie, to knit”).  The sense shifted to "military servant" and later "mounted warrior".
