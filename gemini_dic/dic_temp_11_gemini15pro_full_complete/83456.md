PHRASE-> (Not applicable.  "Habitualness" is a noun and doesn't typically form phrases like "what if" or "what about". It describes a state of being, so it's less likely to be used in these common phrase structures.)


词源：
From habitual + -ness.  "Habitual" comes from Late Latin *habitualis, from Latin habitus "condition, appearance, dress, bearing, character", past participle of habere "to have, hold".
