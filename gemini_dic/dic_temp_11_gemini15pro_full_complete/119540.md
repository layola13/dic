microseismograph:/ˈmaɪkroʊˈsaɪzməɡræf/| n. |微震仪|An instrument that detects and records very faint earth tremors, too small to be noticed by ordinary seismographs.  It is used to study small-scale seismic activity, volcanic activity, and other subtle ground movements.|The microseismograph registered a slight tremor that went unnoticed by the larger seismograph.|Synonyms: tremorgraph, tremor recorder |Antonyms: N/A|noun
