irrationals:/ɪˈræʃənəlz/ | n. |无理数| Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. |  The square root of two is one of the most famous irrationals. 二的平方根是最著名的无理数之一。

|  Pi is an irrational number, meaning its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating. π是一个无理数，这意味着它的小数表示是无限不循环的。 | 近义词: non-rational numbers | 反义词: rational numbers | 词性: noun


词源:
From Late Latin *irrationalis, from in- "not" + rationalis "rational" (from ratio "reason").
