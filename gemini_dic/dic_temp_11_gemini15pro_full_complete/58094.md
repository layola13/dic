ETYMOLOGY->

"Drop dead" originates from the literal meaning of suddenly dropping dead from a heart attack or other sudden cause.  The figurative use as an adjective meaning "stunningly attractive" likely arose from the idea that someone's beauty is so striking it could cause another to figuratively "drop dead" from admiration. The use as an exclamation of anger or impatience is a more direct application of the literal meaning, expressing a wish for someone to die or disappear.
