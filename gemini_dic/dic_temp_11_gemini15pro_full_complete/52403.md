**Etymology:**

The origin of "diddle" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's related to "dawdle," meaning to waste time. Another connects it to the German word "tüdeln," meaning to trifle or play the flute.  The meaning shifted to include cheating or swindling likely in the 18th century.  "Diddlers" is simply the plural noun form.
