associativeness:/əˌsoʊsiəˈtɪvnəs/ | n. |结合律；结合性|The property of an operation whereby the order in which operations are performed does not change the result (provided the grouping of the operands is not changed).  In other words, it doesn't matter where you put the parentheses in an expression. |Addition has the property of associativeness: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). 加法具有结合律的性质：(a + b) + c = a + (b + c). | Synonyms:  commutativity (sometimes, but not precisely), distributivity (related, but different concept) | Antonyms: Non-associativity |noun
