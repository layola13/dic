kilohertz: /ˈkɪləhɜːrts/ (US) /ˈkɪləhɜːtz/ (UK)| n. |千赫兹|A unit of frequency equal to one thousand hertz.|The radio station broadcasts at 101.5 kilohertz.|Synonym: kHz|Antonym: (No direct antonym, but can use units representing lower frequencies like hertz)|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From kilo- + hertz.  "Kilo-" is a combining form representing a factor of one thousand, derived from the Greek *χίλιοι* (chilioi, “thousand”). "Hertz" is named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who first conclusively proved the existence of electromagnetic waves.
