词源:  From Middle English *lechen, from Old English lēace (“physician, healer”), from Proto-West Germanic *lēki (“physician, healer”), from Proto-Germanic *lēkijaz (“physician, healer”), from Proto-Indo-European *leyk- (“to heal”).  The modern meaning developed through a process of semantic degradation, where the original sense of "physician" became associated with "quack doctor" and then with "immoral person," eventually narrowing to "lecher."
