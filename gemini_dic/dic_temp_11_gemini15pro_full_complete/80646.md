gops:/ɡɒps/ | n. |  傻瓜，笨蛋; (复数)警察; |  A slang term, primarily British, used to refer to a foolish or inept person. Can also refer to police officers (plural). |  He made a right gops of himself at the party. 他在聚会上出了大洋相。| 近义词: idiot, fool, dolt, (for police) cops, police | 反义词: genius, mastermind | 词性: 名词


词源:  Likely a shortened and altered form of "gollops," itself a variation of "gallows-bird," an old term for a criminal deserving of hanging.  This association led to its use as slang for police. The meaning "fool" likely developed separately, perhaps influenced by words like "gape" or "gawk," suggesting someone who is easily fooled or acts foolishly.
