ETYMOLOGY->
From noteworthy + -ness.  Noteworthy is from note + worthy. Note comes from Old French note "mark, sign, note," from Latin nota "mark, character, letter, shorthand sign," literally "something known," past participle feminine of noscere "come to know." Worthy comes from Old English weorð "worth, of value; honorable," from Proto-Germanic *werthaus "having worth," from *werth- "worth, price" (from PIE root *wer- (3) "to perceive, watch out for").  The suffix -ness forms nouns from adjectives.
