While "chinked" as a verb or adjective relating to filling gaps or making a clinking sound is not necessarily offensive, it is important to be mindful of the context and potential for misinterpretation.  Consider using synonyms like "filled," "sealed," "caulked," or "jingled" to avoid any unintended offense.
