acanthopteri: /ˌækənˈθɒptəraɪ/ | n. |  棘鳍鱼类 | A group of bony fishes distinguished by having the anterior rays of their dorsal and anal fins composed of non-segmented, unbranched, stiff spines.  They are also characterized by the presence of ctenoid scales. This is a very large and diverse group, including many familiar fishes such as perch, bass, and tuna. | Example:  Acanthopteri are the largest group of teleost fishes. 棘鳍鱼类是硬骨鱼中最大的一个类群。

Example: Many commercially important fish species belong to the Acanthopteri. 许多重要的商业鱼类属于棘鳍鱼类。| 近义词: spiny-rayed fishes | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, could consider groups like Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) as a contrasting group) | 词性: noun
