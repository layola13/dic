词源：From Middle English *flirt, *flurt (“sudden movement”), of imitative origin.  Compare Middle Dutch flurten (“to flutter, flap”). Related to flitter.  The sense development from “sudden movement” to “flirt” likely occurred through an association with the fluttering of a fan, often used by women as a flirting gesture.
