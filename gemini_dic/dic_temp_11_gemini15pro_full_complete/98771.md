intangible (adj.) : late 14c., "incapable of being touched," from Medieval Latin intangibilis "that cannot be touched," from in- "not, opposite of" (see in- (1)) + Late Latin tangibilis "tangible," from Latin tangere "to touch" (from PIE root *tag- "to touch, handle").  The noun meaning "something intangible" is recorded from 1817.
-ness: word-forming element attached to adjectives and participles, forming abstract nouns of quality, condition, or character, from Old English -nes, -nis, from Proto-Germanic *-inassu-, *-anassu- (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian -nis, Dutch -nis, German -nis, Gothic -inassus), abstract noun suffix from the stem of the third person possessive pronoun.
