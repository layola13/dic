词源:  "manic" comes from Greek "manikos," meaning "mad, insane," related to "mania." "Depressive" comes from Late Latin "depress-" meaning "pressed down."


注意事项:  The term "manic-depressive" is now largely outdated and has been replaced by "bipolar disorder." While "manic-depressive" is still sometimes used colloquially, "bipolar disorder" is the preferred and clinically accurate term.
