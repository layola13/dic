PHRASE->
(This phrase doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way as single words do.  It's more commonly used as an adverbial intensifier within a sentence.)

Note: There aren't any direct antonyms for this phrase. The opposite meaning is generally conveyed by using adverbs like "softly," "quietly," "gently," or "moderately" to describe the action.  The same applies for close synonyms - words like "intensely," "vigorously," "energetically" etc. better capture the nuances of the phrase than trying to create set phrases.
