Etymology:
From Middle English *gantre, from Old Norse *gandtré ("magic tree"), from gand ("magic, witchcraft") + tré ("tree"). The meaning shifted to "withered tree" due to the association of bare trees with bleakness and potentially with supernatural beliefs. Later, the term was also applied to thin, haggard individuals.
