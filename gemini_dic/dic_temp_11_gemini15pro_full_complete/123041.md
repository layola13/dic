注意事项:
The term "monera" is outdated and no longer used in modern biological classification.  It has been replaced by the domains Bacteria and Archaea.  While the term may still be encountered in older texts, it's important to be aware of its obsolete status.  The provided information uses the term for the purpose of the exercise, but it's crucial to use current terminology in scientific contexts.
