词源:
From Latin *consularis, from consul (“consul”) + -aris.

注意事项:
Consular can be used both as an adjective and a noun (though the noun form 'consulary' is less common).  Consular relates specifically to consuls and their duties.  Do not confuse it with 'council,' which refers to a governing body.
