mechanicalnesses:/məˈkænɪkəlnəsəz/
|n.|机械性，机械状态|The quality or state of being mechanical; the aggregate of mechanical properties or attributes.|The mechanicalnesses of the robot's movements were unsettling. 机器人动作的机械性令人不安。|Near synonyms: rigidity, stiffness, inflexibility|Near antonyms: fluidity, suppleness, flexibility|Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From mechanical + -ness.  "Mechanical" comes from the Late Latin *mechanicus*, from Greek mēkhanikos "of or belonging to machines," from mēkhanē "machine, contrivance, device," from Doric Greek mēkhana, Attic Greek mēkhanē.  The suffix "-ness" is a native English suffix forming nouns expressing state, quality, or condition.
