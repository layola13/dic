Etymology:
free (adj.) + enterprising (adj.)
* free (adj.): Old English freo "free, exempt, noble; acting of one's own will," from Proto-Germanic *frijaz (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian fri, Old High German vri, German frei, Dutch vrij, Gothic freis), from PIE root *prijos "dear, beloved," hence "belonging to one's own people," also "free."
* enterprising (adj.): from enterprise (n.) + -ing.  Enterprise (n.)  mid-15c., "an undertaking, especially one of some scope, a venture," from Old French enterprise "undertaking, project" (12c.), from entreprendre "undertake" (see entrepreneur).
