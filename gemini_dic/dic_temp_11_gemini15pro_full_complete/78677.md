giftedness's: /ˈɡɪftɪdnəsɪz/ | n. | 天赋，才华 | The possessive form of "giftedness," referring to something belonging to or associated with the state of being gifted.  It is less common than "giftedness" itself and might be considered slightly awkward in some contexts. |  The giftedness's impact on her life was profound.  天赋对她的生活产生了深远的影响。|  Synonyms: talent's, aptitude's, genius's (though these don't perfectly capture the nuance of "giftedness") | Antonyms:  incompetence's, inability's (again, not perfect opposites but represent the opposite end of the spectrum) | noun
