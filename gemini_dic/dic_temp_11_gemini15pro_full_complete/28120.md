capitalnesses: /ˈkæpɪtəlnəsɪz/ | n. | 首都性，首都特质 |  This word is not standard English. It seems to be a neologism formed by adding the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality) to the word "capital"  referring to the characteristics or qualities of being a capital city.  Because it's not a standard word, there's no established usage.  If used, it would likely refer to the qualities or attributes that make a city a capital, such as its political, economic, or cultural significance. |  "The capitalnesses of London are evident in its grand architecture and bustling financial district." (This is an example, as the word is not commonly used.) | Near synonyms (for the concept, not the word itself): importance, significance, prominence, centrality | Antonyms (for the concept): insignificance, periphery, marginality | Noun
