词源:  Lamar is of French origin, likely derived from "la mer," meaning "the sea."  However, as a surname in the United States, it is most often associated with Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas, for whom many places and institutions are named.  Therefore, the word "Lamar" as a place name or institutional name ultimately derives from the personal name.
