neuraxis: /ˈnjʊəræksɪs/ /nʊˈræksɪs/
| n. | 神经轴 | The neuraxis is the main axis of the central nervous system. | The developing neuraxis forms the neural tube.  发育中的神经轴形成神经管。|  central nervous system, cerebrospinal axis | peripheral nervous system | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From neuro- + axis.  Neuro- comes from Greek *neuron* meaning "nerve."  Axis comes from Latin *axis* meaning "axle, pivot."
