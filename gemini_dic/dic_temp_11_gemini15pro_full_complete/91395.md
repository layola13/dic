hydrotropism:/haɪˈdrɒtrəˌpɪzəm/ | n. | 向水性，趋水性 | The growth or turning of plant roots towards or away from moisture. |  The hydrotropism of the roots ensures that they grow towards water sources. 根的向水性确保它们朝着水源生长。

The plant exhibited strong hydrotropism, its roots growing directly towards the damp soil.  这株植物表现出强烈的向水性，它的根直接朝向潮湿的土壤生长。 | 近义词: None (highly specific) | 反义词: None (highly specific) | 词性: noun

词源:  From hydro- (water) + -tropism (turning, movement in response to a stimulus).
