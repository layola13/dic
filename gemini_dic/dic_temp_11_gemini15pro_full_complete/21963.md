Etymology: bog (n.) + trotting (present participle of trot (v.))

bog (n.): from Middle English bogge, of uncertain origin, possibly from Irish or Scottish Gaelic bogach "soft ground."  Refers to wet, spongy ground.

trot (v.): from Old French troter, of Germanic origin.  Refers to a moderately fast gait of a horse or other quadruped, and by extension, to any brisk movement or activity.

Therefore, "bogtrotting" literally means moving through a bog, but figuratively implies spending time on tedious and detailed work, often involving research into obscure subjects.
