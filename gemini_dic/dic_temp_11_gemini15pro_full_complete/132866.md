词源:  "nonegregiously" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "egregious," which means "outstandingly bad; shocking." "Egregious" comes from the Latin word "egregius," meaning "distinguished" or "select," originally in a positive sense.  Over time, its meaning shifted to refer to something standing out in a negative way.
