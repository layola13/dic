Etymology: From Late Latin altercatio, from altercari "to dispute, quarrel," frequentative of altercare "to wrangle, quarrel," from Latin alter "other" (see alter (adj.)) + an element related to the root of carere "to lack" (from PIE root *sker- (1) "to cut"). The notion is of "mutual wrangling, going back and forth."
