conicity's:/kəˈnɪsɪtiz/ | n. |锥度，锥形度|The conicity's of the cone was precisely calculated.  锥体的锥度经过精确计算。|例句：The machinist checked the conicity's of the drill bit.  机械师检查了钻头的锥度。

The conicity's of the rocket nose cone is crucial for its aerodynamics. 火箭鼻锥的锥度对其空气动力学至关重要。|近义词：taper, slope, incline |反义词:cylindricality, flatness |词性:名词

Etymology: From conic + -ity + -'s (possessive).  Conic ultimately derives from the Greek word *kōnos* meaning "cone."  The suffix "-ity" forms nouns of quality or state, and "-'s" indicates possession.  词源：来自 conic + -ity + -'s（所有格）。 Conic 最终源自希腊语 *kōnos*，意思是“锥体”。 后缀“-ity”构成性质或状态的名词，“-'s”表示所有格。
