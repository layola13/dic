注意事项:

"Clapcake" isn't a standard English word, but rather a playful, informal term.  Its meaning is derived from the idea of quickly and easily combining ingredients, as if "clapping" them together.  Because it's not a formal word, there won't be extensive etymology.  It's likely a relatively recent coinage.
