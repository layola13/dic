enstatite:/ˈɛnstəˌtaɪt/ | n. |顽火辉石|A magnesium-rich pyroxene mineral, MgSiO3, occurring in igneous and metamorphic rocks and in meteorites.  It is characterized by its resistance to alteration (hence its name, from the Greek enstates, meaning "opponent").|Enstatite is a common component of certain types of meteorites.  顽火辉石是某些类型陨石的常见成分。|Example: The geologist identified the mineral as enstatite. 地质学家将这种矿物鉴定为顽火辉石。|Synonyms:  orthoenstatite, clinoenstatite, bronzite (for iron-rich varieties)|Antonyms: N/A (Minerals don't typically have antonyms)|Noun
