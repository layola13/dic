注意事项:
The word "aucht" is primarily used in Scottish dialects and its usage is declining. Its inclusion in contemporary texts is often for stylistic effect, particularly when evoking a Scottish setting or character.  While grammatically correct within these dialects, its use in standard English might be considered archaic or dialectal.
