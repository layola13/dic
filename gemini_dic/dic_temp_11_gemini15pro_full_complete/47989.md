PHRASE->
(Not a common phrase structure, decimate usually stands alone as a transitive verb)


注意事项:  While decimate originally meant "to kill one in every ten,"  its modern usage generally refers to widespread destruction or severe reduction, not literally one-tenth.  Using it to mean "destroy a small portion" is considered incorrect by many.
