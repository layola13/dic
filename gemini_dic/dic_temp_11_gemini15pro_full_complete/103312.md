词源:
The origin of "jigger" is uncertain.  One theory connects it to the word "chigue," referring to a sand flea, perhaps because of the small size or irritating nature of the things it describes.  Another suggests a connection to the verb "jig," implying a quick, jerky movement.  The meaning related to a small measure of alcohol likely emerged in the 19th century.
