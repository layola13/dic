注意事项:

Ninthly is quite formal and rarely used in spoken English.  It is generally used in written English, especially in formal reports, presentations, or legal documents.  In everyday conversation or informal writing, it is more common to use simpler ordinal numbers like "first," "second," "third," and then switch to cardinal numbers like "four," "five," "six," and so on, or to rephrase the sentence entirely.
