词源: Both "angina" and "anginas" derive from the Latin word "angina," meaning "strangling" or "sore throat."  This Latin word itself comes from "angere," meaning "to choke" or "to strangle." The plural form "anginas" specifically refers to multiple instances of sore throat or tonsillitis, while the singular "angina" typically refers to angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart), although it can also mean a severe sore throat.
