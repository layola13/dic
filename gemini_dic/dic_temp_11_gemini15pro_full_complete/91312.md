hydrometrograph:/ˌhaɪdrəˈmɛtrəɡræf/ | n. |水位计，水位记录器 | An instrument that records the height of water, especially river levels, over a period of time.  It combines the functions of a hydrometer (measuring water density) and a metrograph (recording measurements).| The hydrometrograph showed a significant rise in the river level after the heavy rain. 水位计显示暴雨过后河流水位显著上升。| synonym:  water level recorder, limnimeter | antonym: N/A | noun

hydrometrograph:/ˌhaɪdrəˈmɛtrəɡræf/ | n. |水位记录图 | A graph or chart produced by a hydrometrograph, showing the variation of water level over time. | The hydrometrograph clearly illustrated the tidal patterns over the past week.  水位记录图清楚地显示了过去一周的潮汐模式。| synonym: water level chart, stage hydrograph | antonym: N/A | noun
