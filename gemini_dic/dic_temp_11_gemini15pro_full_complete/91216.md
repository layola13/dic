hydrobilirubin:/ˌhaɪdroʊˌbɪlɪˈruːbɪn/
noun
氢胆红素
A reduced form of bilirubin produced by the action of intestinal bacteria. It is colorless and normally oxidized back to bilirubin.
Example: The presence of hydrobilirubin in the stool indicates normal bilirubin metabolism.  粪便中氢胆红素的存在表明胆红素代谢正常。

Example:  Elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin can lead to increased production of hydrobilirubin.  结合胆红素水平升高会导致氢胆红素产量增加。

Synonym: urobilinogen
Antonym: biliverdin (a precursor to bilirubin)
n.
