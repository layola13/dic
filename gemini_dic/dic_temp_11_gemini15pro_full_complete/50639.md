词源:  "Deril" is an archaic or dialectal form of "devil," ultimately deriving from the Old English "dēofol,"  and further back to the Late Latin "diabolus."  Over time, the word underwent various phonetic shifts and spellings, leading to forms like "deril" alongside the more common "devil."  While "devil" retained its strong religious connotations, "deril" often took on a more lighthearted or playful meaning, referring to mischievousness rather than outright evil.
