"Golder" itself doesn't have common phrases associated with it the way "gold" does (e.g., "gold standard," "worth its weight in gold"). The word is more straightforward and describes a profession.  However, phrases related to the activity of gold panning or prospecting would be relevant, such as "panning for gold," "striking it rich," or "gold fever."
