词源:
From Middle English *incogni, from Latin *incognitus (“unknown, unfamiliar”), from in- (“not”) + cognitus, perfect passive participle of cognōscō (“I get to know”).  The semantic shift from "unknown" to "rare, precious" likely occurred through an intermediate meaning of "strange, unfamiliar, but intriguing."
