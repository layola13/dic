bulletproofs:/ˈbʊlɪtpruːfs/
noun
防弹的;防弹衣;防弹装置
cryptographic proofs that are computationally sound and succinct, and do not require a trusted setup.  They allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
Transactions using bulletproofs are smaller and faster than traditional confidential transactions. 交易使用防弹证明比传统的机密交易更小更快。
Bulletproofs are a relatively new technology, but they are already being used in a number of cryptocurrency projects. 防弹证明是一项相对较新的技术，但它们已经被用于许多加密货币项目中。
Synonyms: tamper-proof, impenetrable
Antonyms: vulnerable, permeable
n.
