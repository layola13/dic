The word "mareis" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism.  The closest words are "mares" (plural of "mare") and "Maria" (a female name).  I will provide analyses for both:

mare: /mɛər/ | n. | 母马 | A female horse. | The farmer had several mares in his field. | 农场主的地里有好几匹母马。 | synonyms: female horse | antonyms: stallion, colt | noun

mares: /mɛərz/ | n. | 母马（复数） | Plural of "mare," referring to multiple female horses. | The mares grazed peacefully in the pasture. | 母马们在牧场上安静地吃草。 | synonyms: female horses | antonyms: stallions, colts | noun
