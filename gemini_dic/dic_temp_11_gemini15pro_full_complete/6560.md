Etymology->

From Middle English *an, *a, from Old English ān “one,” from Proto-Germanic *ainaz, from Proto-Indo-European *oinos. Cognate with Old Frisian ān, ēn (“one”), Old Saxon ēn (“one”), Old High German ein (“one”), Old Norse einn (“one”), Gothic 𐌰𐌹𐌽𐍃 (ains), Latin ūnus (“one”), Ancient Greek οἴνη (oínē, “ace on dice”), Old Church Slavonic ино (ino, “another, other”). Ultimately from the same source as one.  The reduced form a developed before consonants.
