词源:
From "deformedness,"  which comes from "deformed" + "-ness."  "Deformed" originates from the Old French "deformer" (to deform), derived from the Latin "deformare" (to disfigure, deform), from "de-" (from, away from) + "formare" (to form, shape).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
