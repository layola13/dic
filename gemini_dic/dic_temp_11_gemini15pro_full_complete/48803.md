注意事项:

The word "deflourer" carries a strong negative connotation and is often associated with sexual assault.  It is considered archaic and is rarely used in modern English.  More common and less offensive terms like "rapist" or "assaulter" are preferred when referring to acts of sexual violence.  Use with caution.
