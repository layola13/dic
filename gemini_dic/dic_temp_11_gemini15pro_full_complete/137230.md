It's more common to use the verb "surrender" in phrases, negated by "not":
do not surrender = 不要投降
never surrender = 永不投降
refuse to surrender = 拒绝投降
will not surrender = 不会投降
did not surrender = 没有投降


注意事项:  由于 "nonsurrenders"  本身就是一个名词，所以它没有动词或形容词的用法。  它的用法主要集中在描述不屈不挠的人或群体。  在实际使用中，"nonsurrenders" 比 "resisters" 或 "holdouts" 更强调一种精神上的不屈。
