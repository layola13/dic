chromophane: /ˈkrəʊməfeɪn/ | n. | 变色物质，变色现象 | A substance exhibiting chromophany, or the phenomenon itself.  It refers to a change in color of a material due to a change in temperature, pressure, or light. | Example 1: The chromophane in the mineral changed color when heated. 这种矿物中的变色物质受热后改变了颜色。

Example 2:  Researchers are studying the chromophane of certain butterflies' wings. 研究人员正在研究某些蝴蝶翅膀的变色现象。 | Synonym: thermochromic (when related to temperature), photochromic (when related to light), piezochromic (when related to pressure) | Antonym: N/A (lack of color change would simply be described as stable or unchanging color) | noun
