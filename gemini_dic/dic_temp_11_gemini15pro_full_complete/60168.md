efferent:/ˈɛfərənt/| adj. | 传出的；输出的 | Conducting or conveying away from a center, especially a nerve fiber that carries impulses away from the central nervous system. | The efferent nerves carry signals from the brain to the muscles.  传出神经将信号从大脑传递到肌肉。|Example: The efferent nerve pathways carry motor commands from the central nervous system to the muscles.  传出神经通路将运动指令从中枢神经系统传递到肌肉。|Synonyms:  outgoing, exiting, centrifugal | Antonyms: afferent, incoming, centripetal | adjective

efferent:/ˈɛfərənt/| n. | 传出神经；输出管 | An efferent nerve fiber or vessel. | The efferents from the superior cervical ganglion supply the heart. 来自颈上神经节的传出神经支配心脏。|Example: The surgeon carefully identified the efferents during the procedure.  外科医生在手术过程中仔细识别了传出神经。|Synonyms:  outgoing vessel, output channel | Antonyms: afferent vessel, input channel | noun
