hypergeneticalnesses:/ˌhaɪpərʤəˈnɛtɪkəlnɪsɪz/ | n. | 超遗传性 |  The state or quality of being hypergenetical, referring to extreme or excessive genetic influence. This word is extremely rare and likely coined or highly specialized. |  Due to its rarity, constructing natural sentences is difficult. A contrived example could be: "The scientist postulated that the observed phenomenon was due to the hypergeneticalnesses of the species, though his theory was met with skepticism." | Near synonyms:  (Difficult to provide due to the word's rarity. Perhaps "extreme heritability" or "overwhelming genetic predisposition") | Antonyms: (Difficult to provide, potentially "environmental influence") | noun

PHRASE-> (Due to the word's rarity, common phrases are unlikely.)
 It's difficult to construct natural phrases with "hypergeneticalnesses" due to its extremely low usage.  Focus on the core meaning of "extreme genetic influence" when attempting to use it.
