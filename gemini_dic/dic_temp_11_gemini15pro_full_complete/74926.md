词源:
From Middle English *fretten*, from Old English *fretan* (“to devour, consume, eat up”), from Proto-Germanic *frataną* (“to gnaw, rub”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰer- (“to rub, scratch”). Cognate with Old Frisian *fretta* (“to gnaw, rub”), Middle Dutch *vreten* (“to devour”), German *fressen* (“to devour (of animals)”), Swedish *fräta* (“to corrode”). More at fret.  The meaning shifted from "gnaw" to "worry" over time.
