注意事项:

"How've" is very informal and primarily used in spoken English.  It's generally avoided in formal writing.  It's almost always followed by "you" and a form of "be," making it suitable for inquiring about someone's well-being or recent experiences.  Using it in other tenses or sentence structures can sound awkward or grammatically incorrect.
