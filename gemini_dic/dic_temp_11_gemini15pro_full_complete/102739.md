Etymology: From Ottoman Turkish يڭيچرى (yeniçeri, “new soldier, Janissary”), from yeni (“new”) + çeri (“troop”). The Janissaries were an elite corps in the Ottoman army, often involved in suppressing dissent and maintaining order, sometimes through brutal means.  This historical context gives the word its connotation of violent purging.
