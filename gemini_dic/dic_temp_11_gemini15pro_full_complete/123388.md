monomyaria:/ˌmɒnəˈmaɪəriə/ | n. | 单壳类动物 |A subclass of bivalve mollusks characterized by having only one shell or valve, or having two unequal valves.  This term is now considered obsolete, and the group it described is now generally classified within the Bivalvia. |  (No longer used in modern scientific classification, so examples are difficult to construct.  A historical example might be:)  "In older texts, oysters were sometimes classified under Monomyaria." | 近义词: (In a broad sense) Bivalvia | 反义词: None (as it's an obsolete classification within a larger group)| noun
