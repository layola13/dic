friation:/fraɪˈeɪʃən/ | n. | 摩擦，摩擦力 | The friation between the two surfaces generated heat. 两个表面之间的摩擦产生了热量。|  Friation is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other. 摩擦力是抵抗固体表面、流体层和材料元素相对运动的力。 | Example: The friation between the tires and the road allowed the car to stop quickly. 轮胎和路面之间的摩擦力使汽车能够快速停车。

Example:  The friation of the rope against the rock caused it to fray. 绳子与岩石的摩擦导致绳子磨损。 | Synonyms: rubbing, abrasion, attrition | Antonyms: smoothness, lubrication | noun
