nonreflection:/ˌnɒnrɪˈflɛkʃən/ | n. | 非反射，无反思 | Absence of reflection; lack of thoughtful consideration. | The nonreflection of the surface made it difficult to see. 表面不反光，很难看清。|  The nonreflection of sound in the anechoic chamber was eerie.  消声室里没有声音反射，感觉怪怪的。 | 近义词: non-reflectivity, opacity (in some contexts) | 反义词: reflection, reflectivity | 词性: 名词

词源:
non- (prefix):  from Latin *non "not".
reflection (noun): from Late Latin reflexionem (nominative reflexio) "a bending back," noun of action from past-participle stem of reflectere "bend back," from re- "back" + flectere "to bend".
