注意事项:

"Khenna" is an alternative spelling of "henna," and both are commonly used. This entry uses "khenna" as requested by the prompt, but it's important to be aware of both spellings.  Although sometimes categorized as a dye, henna stains rather than dyes, binding with the keratin in skin, hair, and nails.
