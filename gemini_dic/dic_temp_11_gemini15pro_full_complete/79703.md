注意事项:
*  "Glucic" is not a very common term in everyday English. "Glycemic" is much more frequently used.  Although "glucic" is technically correct and understood within scientific contexts, using "glycemic" is generally preferred.
* While antonyms are provided, the concept of an opposite to "relating to glucose" is somewhat nuanced.  "Aglycemic" refers to the absence of sugar, which isn't a direct opposite of the presence or relevance of glucose.
