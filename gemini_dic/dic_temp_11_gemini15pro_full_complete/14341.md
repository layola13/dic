automorphic:/ˌɔːtəˈmɔːrfɪk/
adjective
自守的，自同构的
(of a number) such that the last digits of its square, cube, etc., are the same as the last digits of the number itself.  A number is called automorphic if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself.
Example: 5 is automorphic because 5 squared is 25, which ends in 5.
25 is automorphic because 25 squared is 625, which ends in 25.
76 is automorphic because 76 squared is 5776, which ends in 76.
Synonym: self-power
Antonym: Non-automorphic
词性: adjective
