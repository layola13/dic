词源:  "Disclout" is a relatively recent word formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to "clout" (meaning "influence" or "power").  "Clout" itself comes from Old English "clūt" meaning "piece of cloth" or "patch," later evolving to mean a blow with a cloth or rag, and eventually metaphorical "influence."
