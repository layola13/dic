词源:  "abanet" likely comes from a combination of "abaisser" (French for "to lower") and "net." While this isn't definitively documented, the function of the net to lower or lessen the impact of a fall makes this a plausible explanation.  The term might also be a more modern formation, simply combining "a" and "ban-net," suggesting a net that bans or prevents harm from falling.
