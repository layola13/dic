jettiness:/ˈdʒɛtɪnɪs/
n.|喷射性，喷射状|The quality of resembling a jet; the degree to which something resembles a stream of liquid or gas forced out of a small opening.|The jettiness of the fountain was impressive. 喷泉的喷射状令人印象深刻。|近义词：stream, spray, spout|反义词: stillness, stagnation|词性:名词
词源: From jet + -ness.  "Jet" originates from the Old French "jet" meaning a throw or a gush, ultimately from the Latin "jactare," frequentative of "jacere," meaning "to throw."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
