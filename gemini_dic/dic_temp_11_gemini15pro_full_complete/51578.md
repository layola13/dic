deutosulphuret:/daɪˌtɒsʌlˈfaɪd/| n.|二硫化物|A compound containing two atoms of sulphur combined with another element or radical.  Specifically, it often refers to iron disulfide (FeS₂), also known as pyrite or fool's gold.|Pyrite, a deutosulphuret of iron, is often mistaken for gold.|Synonym: disulfide, persulfide|Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps a monosulfide if one exists for the specific element)|noun
