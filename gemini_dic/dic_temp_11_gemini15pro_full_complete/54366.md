dishouse: /dɪsˈhaʊs/
| n. | 混乱，脏乱; 妓院 (旧时用法) | A state of disorder and uncleanliness; a brothel (archaic). |  The apartment was a complete dishouse after the party. / 派对结束后，公寓里一片狼藉。 The old building was rumored to be a dishouse. / 据说那栋老房子以前是妓院。 | 近义词: mess, pigsty, shambles, brothel (archaic) | 反义词: order, tidiness, cleanliness | 词性: 名词


词源:  "dishouse" comes from "dis-" (a prefix indicating negation or reversal) and "house".  While the literal meaning would suggest an un-housed or dismantled house, it evolved to mean a house in disarray. The connection to brothel is likely due to the perceived disorder and immorality associated with such establishments in the past.
