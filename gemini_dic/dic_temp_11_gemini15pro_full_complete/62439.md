endopleurite:/ˈɛndoʊplʊˌraɪt/| n. |内骨骼片，内侧片|A hardened plate or sclerite derived from the endopleuron, an infolding of the arthropod body wall that forms part of the internal skeleton, especially in the thorax of insects.  It serves for muscle attachment and support.|The endopleurites of this beetle species are unusually large.  这种甲虫的内骨骼片异常大。|Synonym: apodeme (although not strictly synonymous, they are related structures)|Antonym: (No direct antonym exists.  One might consider the exoskeleton as a contrasting structure, but it's not a true antonym.)|noun
