词源:
"Hellhag" is a compound word formed from "hell" and "hag." "Hell" derives from Old English "hel," meaning "the abode of the dead, the infernal regions," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*haljō." "Hag" also comes from Old English "hægtesse," meaning "witch," with uncertain further etymology. The combination creates a term for a particularly malevolent and frightening witch associated with hell.
