nonterminals:/nɒnˈtɜːmɪnəlz/ | n. | 非终结符 |  In formal language theory, particularly in the context of grammars (like those used in defining programming languages or natural languages), a nonterminal symbol (often abbreviated as nonterminal) is a symbol that can be replaced by other symbols according to the rules of the grammar.  Nonterminals represent syntactic categories (like noun phrase, verb phrase, etc.) and are used to define the structure of the language. They contrast with terminal symbols, which are the actual words or characters of the language. |  The grammar uses nonterminals to represent phrases like "noun phrase" or "verb phrase." | 近义词: syntactic variable,  metavariable | 反义词: terminals | 词性: noun
