ETYMOLOGY->
From counter- + check.  "Counter-" acts as a prefix indicating opposition, reciprocal action, or correspondence. "Check" comes from Old French "eschec" meaning "check" (in chess), and ultimately from Persian "shah" meaning "king". Thus, "countercheck" implies a check against another check, creating a balance or control.
