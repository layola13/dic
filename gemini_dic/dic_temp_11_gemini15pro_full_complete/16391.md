ETYMOLOGY->
From *malonylurea* (the original chemical name for barbituric acid), ultimately from *malonic acid* (named after its discoverer, French chemist Victor Dessaignes, who derived it from *malic acid* which is found in apples, from Latin *mālum* "apple") + urea (a nitrogenous compound found in urine, from French *urée*, from Greek *ouron* "urine").  The name *barbituric acid* was coined by Adolf von Baeyer, who reportedly named it after a woman named Barbara whom he knew.
