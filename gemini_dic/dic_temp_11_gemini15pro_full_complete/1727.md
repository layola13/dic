ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *acontant (Modern French comptant "counting, accountable"), present participle of aconter "to count, render account," from a- "to" + conter "to count."  The spelling change from -o- to -ou- reflects a pronunciation change in French.  The English word was re-spelled by analogy with Latin computare.
