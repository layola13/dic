词源:
Origin uncertain, perhaps imitative.  The word first appears in the late 17th century.  Some speculate a connection to the Dutch word *nicompoop* (although no such word is attested in Dutch).  Others suggest a possible link to the obsolete word *ninny* (fool) + *poop* (a fool).  The ultimate origin remains obscure.
