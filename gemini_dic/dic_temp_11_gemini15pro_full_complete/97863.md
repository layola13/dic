词源:  "inlive" is likely a relatively recent term formed by combining "in" (meaning within or during) and "live" (referring to a real-time broadcast).  It doesn't have a long established etymology like many traditional English words. It is more of a colloquial and modern usage, particularly prevalent in the context of internet streaming.
