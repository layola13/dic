注意事项:  "Melan" itself isn't a commonly used word in everyday English. It's more of a technical or scientific term. The more common words related to this concept are "melanin," "melanoma," and "melanocyte."  While “melan” can refer to a feeling of sadness or gloom, this usage is archaic and rarely seen in modern English.
