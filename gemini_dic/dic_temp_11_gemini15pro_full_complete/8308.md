注意事项:
This term is inherently offensive and should be used with extreme caution, primarily in discussions of historical context or to directly quote offensive material.  Its usage should always highlight its problematic nature.  Using more neutral and accurate language like "racism against East and Southeast Asians" or "anti-Asian prejudice" is strongly recommended.
