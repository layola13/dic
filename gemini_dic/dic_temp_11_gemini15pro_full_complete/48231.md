deconstructor:/ˌdiːkənˈstrʌktər/ |n.|解构者，析构函数| A deconstructor is a special method in object-oriented programming that is called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It is used to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime, such as memory allocated dynamically.  |The deconstructor ensured that the file handles were closed properly.| synonyms: destructor, finalizer | antonyms: constructor | noun

deconstructors:/ˌdiːkənˈstrʌktərz/ |n.|解构者们，析构函数们| Plural form of "deconstructor".  |The deconstructors in this programming language are automatically called.| synonyms: destructors, finalizers | antonyms: constructors | noun


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The deconstructor releases memory when the object is no longer needed. = 当对象不再需要时，析构函数释放内存。

The program uses deconstructors to manage resources efficiently. = 程序使用析构函数来有效地管理资源。


现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The deconstructor is currently cleaning up the allocated memory. = 析构函数正在清理已分配的内存。

The system is using deconstructors to prevent memory leaks. = 系统正在使用析构函数来防止内存泄漏。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The deconstructor has released all the resources held by the object. = 析构函数已经释放了对象持有的所有资源。

The program has successfully used deconstructors to avoid errors. = 程序已经成功地使用析构函数来避免错误。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The deconstructor has been working to free up memory for the last few milliseconds. = 在过去的几毫秒里，析构函数一直在努力释放内存。

The system has been utilizing deconstructors to maintain stability. = 系统一直在利用析构函数来保持稳定性。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The deconstructor released the memory when the object went out of scope. = 当对象超出范围时，析构函数释放了内存。

The program used deconstructors to prevent resource leaks. = 程序使用析构函数来防止资源泄漏。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The deconstructor was releasing memory when the program crashed. = 程序崩溃时，析构函数正在释放内存。

The system was using deconstructors to manage resources at the time of the error. = 错误发生时，系统正在使用析构函数来管理资源。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The deconstructor had already released the memory before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，析构函数已经释放了内存。

The program had utilized deconstructors effectively before termination. = 在终止之前，程序已经有效地利用了析构函数。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The deconstructor had been releasing memory for a while before the program finished. = 在程序完成之前，析构函数已经释放了一段时间的内存。

The system had been using deconstructors consistently to maintain performance. = 系统一直持续使用析构函数来维护性能。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The deconstructor will release the resources when the object is destroyed. = 当对象被销毁时，析构函数将释放资源。

The program will use deconstructors to ensure proper cleanup. = 程序将使用析构函数来确保正确的清理。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The deconstructor will be releasing memory during the shutdown process. = 在关机过程中，析构函数将释放内存。

The system will be utilizing deconstructors to free up resources. = 系统将利用析构函数来释放资源。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the time the program finishes, the deconstructor will have released all allocated memory. = 当程序完成时，析构函数将已经释放所有分配的内存。

The system will have used deconstructors to prevent any memory leaks. = 系统将已经使用析构函数来防止任何内存泄漏。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the end of the process, the deconstructor will have been releasing memory for several minutes. = 到进程结束时，析构函数将已经释放内存几分钟了。

The system will have been utilizing deconstructors to maintain stability throughout the operation. = 在整个操作过程中，系统将已经利用析构函数来保持稳定性。

PHRASE->
