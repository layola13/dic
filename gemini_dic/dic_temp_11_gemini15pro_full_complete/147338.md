Etymology:
From "over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi, meaning "above, beyond") + "mourn" (Middle English mournen, from Old French morner, ultimately from Latin *minari, "to threaten," later "to lament").  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning of "mourn" to suggest excessive grieving.
