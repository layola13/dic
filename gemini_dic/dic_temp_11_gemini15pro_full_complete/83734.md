ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *hailen, from Old Norse heila ("to greet, salute, hail"), from Proto-Germanic *hailjaną ("to call, invoke, summon"), from Proto-Indo-European *kel- ("to shout, call").  The sense of "coming from" developed later, perhaps influenced by the nautical use of "hail" to call out to a ship to identify its origin.
