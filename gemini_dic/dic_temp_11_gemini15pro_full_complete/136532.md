nonruminatingly:/nɒnˈruːmɪneɪtɪŋli/
| adv. | 非反刍地，不沉思地 | Without ruminating; in a way that does not involve deep thought or reflection. |  She nonruminatingly accepted his offer. 她不假思索地接受了他的提议。 | Example: He nonruminatingly agreed to the proposal, not fully understanding the implications. 他未经深思熟虑就同意了这个提议，并没有完全理解其含义。 | Synonyms: thoughtlessly, unreflectively, impulsively | Antonyms: thoughtfully, reflectively, deliberately | 词性:副词

Etymology:
From non- + ruminating + -ly.  "Ruminate" comes from the Latin "ruminari," meaning "to chew the cud," which was extended metaphorically to mean "to ponder" or "to think over."  The prefix "non-" negates the verb, and the suffix "-ly" turns it into an adverb.
