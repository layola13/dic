ETYMOLOGY->
From cute + -ness.  "Cute" itself has a somewhat debated etymology, possibly originating as a shortened form of "acute" in the sense of "sharp, clever," which later evolved to mean "attractive, pretty," and eventually "delightfully pretty and often also small." The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
