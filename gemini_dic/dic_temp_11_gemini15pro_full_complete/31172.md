changeabilities: /ˌtʃeɪndʒəˈbɪlɪtiz/ | n. | 可变性，易变性 | The changeabilities of the weather made it difficult to plan a picnic. 天气的多变性使得很难计划野餐。|  The stock market's changeabilities can be nerve-wracking for investors. 股票市场的易变性可能会让投资者感到不安。 | Synonyms: variability, mutability, fluidity, instability | Antonyms: stability, constancy, immutability | noun

Etymology:  From "changeable" + "-ity".  "Changeable" comes from the verb "change" (from Old French "changier," ultimately from Latin "cambiare" - to barter),  plus the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of being").  The suffix "-ity" transforms the adjective "changeable" into the abstract noun "changeability," indicating the quality or state of being changeable.
