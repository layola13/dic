amitosis:/ˌeɪmaɪˈtoʊsɪs/ /ˌæmɪˈtəʊsɪs/ | n. |无丝分裂，直接分裂|A type of cell division that occurs without the formation of a spindle or the appearance of chromosomes; direct cell division.  It is characterized by the constriction of the nucleus, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.  This process is considered more primitive than mitosis and meiosis. | Amitosis is observed in some prokaryotes and certain eukaryotic cells.  无丝分裂在某些原核生物和某些真核细胞中被观察到。|  Amitosis is less common than mitosis in multicellular organisms.  在多细胞生物中，无丝分裂不如有丝分裂常见。 |Synonyms: direct cell division | Antonyms: mitosis, meiosis | noun
