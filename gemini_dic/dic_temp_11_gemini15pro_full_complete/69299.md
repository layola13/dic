PHRASE->

(Febrend is a brand name, so it doesn't typically appear in common phrases. The following are examples of phrases using the general term "fever reducer":)

Take a fever reducer if your temperature is high. 如果你的体温很高，就服用退烧药。
The doctor recommended a fever reducer for my child. 医生建议我的孩子服用退烧药。
He needs a fever reducer to bring down his temperature. 他需要退烧药来降低体温。
She took a fever reducer and felt much better. 她服用了退烧药，感觉好多了。

注意事项:

Since "Febrend" appears to be a proper noun (a brand name), its usage will largely be limited to contexts discussing that specific product. It wouldn't have synonyms or antonyms in the same way a common noun would.  I have provided examples using the more general term "fever reducer" for the phrase section because of this limitation.  It's also important to consult a medical professional before taking any medication, including Febrend or other fever reducers.  This information is not intended as medical advice.
