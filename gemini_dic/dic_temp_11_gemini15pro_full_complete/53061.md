diopter:/daɪˈɒptər/ (US) /ˈdaɪ.ɒp.tər/ (UK)| n.|屈光度|A unit of measurement of the refractive power of a lens or curved mirror, equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.  It is used to describe the strength of corrective lenses prescribed for eyeglasses, contact lenses, and other optical devices.|The ophthalmologist prescribed lenses with a diopter of -2.00 for her myopia.|Synonyms: refractive power, lens power|Antonyms: N/A|noun

dioptre:/daɪˈɒptər/ (US) /ˈdaɪ.ɒp.tər/ (UK)| n.|屈光度|Same as diopter (chiefly British spelling).|The optician said I needed a dioptre of +1.50 for reading.|Synonyms: refractive power, lens power|Antonyms: N/A|noun
