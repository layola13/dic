词源:  From fiend + -ed,  "fiend" comes from Old English *fēond (attested only as a prefix and in plural fēondas), from Proto-Germanic *fijandaz "hater, enemy" (source also of Old Saxon fiond, Old Frisian fiand, Old High German fiant, German Feind "enemy," Old Norse fjándi "enemy," Gothic fijands). Meaning shifted in Middle English to "Satan, the Devil," then to "evil spirit, demon" (late 14c.), and finally to "wicked or cruel person" (1590s).
