ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "begrudge" + "-er" (agent suffix).  "Begrudge" comes from the Middle English "bigrucche," from the Old English "begrucigan" (to murmur against, complain of), a compound of "be-" (intensive prefix) and "grucigan" (to grumble, murmur). Ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*grukkōjaną" (to grumble).
