注意事项:

"blessing's" is not standard English. While grammatically possible to indicate possession, it's much more common and natural to use "blessings" (plural) or rephrase with "of a blessing." For example, "the power of a blessing" is preferable to "the blessing's power."  If referring to something that belongs to a single, specific blessing, “the blessing’s impact” is acceptable.
