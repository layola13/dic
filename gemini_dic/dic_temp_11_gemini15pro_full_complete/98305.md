注意事项:  The possessive form "insight's" is grammatically correct but less common than "insights."  Using the plural "insights" or rephrasing the sentence is often stylistically preferable.  For example, instead of "Her insight's were valuable," it's more natural to say "Her insights were valuable" or "Her valuable insights proved crucial."
