词源: out- + rival. "Out-" is a prefix meaning "beyond," "more than," or "to surpass." "Rival" comes from the Latin word "rivalis," meaning "of or belonging to the same brook," thus "one using the same stream," which later developed the sense of "competitor."  Therefore, "outrival" literally means to surpass a competitor.
