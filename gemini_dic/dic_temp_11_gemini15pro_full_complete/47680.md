词源：
"Debug" originated in the 1940s, attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper, who found a moth trapped in a relay of the Mark II computer, hindering its operation.  Removing the moth was referred to as "debugging."  The term "bug," meaning a defect, predates this incident, but Hopper's story popularized "debug" in the context of computing.
