anisotropy:/ˌænɪˈsɒtrəpi/ /ˌænɪˈsɑːtrəpi/| n. |各向异性|The property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy.  This means that the properties of a material are different in different directions.|The anisotropy of wood makes it easier to split along the grain than across it. 木头的各向异性使得它沿着纹理劈开比横着劈开更容易。|Near synonyms: nonuniformity, inhomogeneity|Antonym: isotropy|noun
