PHRASE->
(Since "flon" is a hypothetical particle with no established usage in common phrases, it's difficult to provide meaningful phrase examples.  Instead, I'll offer examples of how the word might be used in hypothetical contexts.)

The properties of the *hypothetical flon* are still debated.  假想弗隆的特性仍在争论中。
The *elusive flon* continues to evade detection.  难以捉摸的弗隆仍然无法被探测到。
Researchers are trying to model the behavior of the *theoretical flon*.  研究人员正在试图模拟理论弗隆的行为。
The *existence of the flon* remains purely speculative.  弗隆的存在仍然纯粹是推测。
The *search for the flon* has been largely unsuccessful.  对弗隆的搜索基本上没有成功。
