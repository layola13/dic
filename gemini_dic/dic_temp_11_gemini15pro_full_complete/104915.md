The word "keiss" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context, like where you encountered the word, I might be able to give you more information.

Since I can't analyze "keiss", I will provide an analysis for the word "case" as a demonstration of the requested format.  If "keiss" is a misspelling of another word, please let me know and I will analyze that word instead.
