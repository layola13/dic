effector:/ɪˈfɛktər/| n.|效应器；效应物；执行机构|An effector is a muscle, gland, or organ capable of responding to a stimulus, especially a nerve impulse.|Muscle cells are effectors that enable movement.|近义词: actuator, executor, organ, muscle, gland|反义词: sensor, receptor|noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The effector receives signals from the brain. = 效应器接收来自大脑的信号。
The effector carries out the body's response. = 效应器执行身体的反应。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The effector is contracting rapidly. = 效应器正在快速收缩。
The gland is secreting hormones as an effector. = 腺体作为效应器正在分泌激素。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The effector has responded to the stimulus. = 效应器已经对刺激做出了反应。
The muscle has contracted as the effector. = 肌肉作为效应器已经收缩。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The effector has been working continuously. = 效应器一直在持续工作。
The gland has been releasing hormones for hours. = 腺体已经释放激素好几个小时了。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The effector reacted immediately. = 效应器立即做出反应。
The muscle contracted forcefully. = 肌肉有力地收缩。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The effector was responding when the signal stopped. = 当信号停止时，效应器正在做出反应。
The gland was secreting hormones at a steady rate. = 腺体以稳定的速率分泌激素。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The effector had already responded before the second signal arrived. = 在第二个信号到达之前，效应器已经做出了反应。
The muscle had contracted completely. = 肌肉已经完全收缩。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The effector had been working for hours before it fatigued. = 效应器在疲劳之前已经工作了几个小时。
The gland had been secreting hormones continuously. = 腺体一直在持续分泌激素。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The effector will respond to the stimulus. = 效应器将对刺激做出反应。
The muscle will contract. = 肌肉将会收缩。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The effector will be responding to the stimulus. = 效应器将对刺激做出反应。
The muscle will be contracting. = 肌肉将正在收缩。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The effector will have responded by then. = 到那时，效应器将已经做出反应。
The muscle will have contracted fully. = 肌肉将已经完全收缩。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The effector will have been working for hours. = 效应器将已经工作了几个小时。
The gland will have been secreting hormones for a prolonged period. = 腺体将已经分泌激素很长一段时间。


虚拟语气:
If the effector were damaged, the response would be impaired. = 如果效应器受损，反应就会受损。
If the muscle were stronger, the movement would be more powerful. = 如果肌肉更强壮，运动就会更有力。

被动语态:
The effector is activated by a nerve impulse. = 效应器被神经冲动激活。
The muscle is stimulated to contract. = 肌肉受到刺激而收缩。

疑问句:
What is the primary effector in this reflex arc? = 在这个反射弧中，主要的效应器是什么？
How does the effector respond to the stimulus? = 效应器如何对刺激做出反应？

否定句:
The effector does not respond to every stimulus. = 效应器并非对每个刺激都做出反应。
The muscle is not contracting. = 肌肉没有收缩。


PHRASE->
immune effector cells = 免疫效应细胞
effector mechanisms = 效应机制
effector molecules = 效应分子
effector proteins = 效应蛋白
effector function = 效应器功能
