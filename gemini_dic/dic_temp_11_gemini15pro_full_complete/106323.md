词源:
Likely a variant of "cough," influenced by Dutch "koffie" (coffee), possibly mimicking the sound of a suppressed cough or the act of taking a quick sip.  The connection to "coffee" might be due to the common practice of taking a quick sip of coffee.  Less likely, but possible origins include a shortening of "coff," an obsolete form of "cough," or onomatopoeia.
