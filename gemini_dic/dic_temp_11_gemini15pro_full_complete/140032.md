oenanthylidene:/iːnænˈθɪlɪdiːn/ | n. |  烯戊叉基; 庚叉基 | A bivalent radical, C7H14, derived from oenanthol. |  The reaction yields oenanthylidene. 这个反应生成烯戊叉基。| 近义词: heptylidene | 反义词: 无 | 词性: 名词

词源:  From oenanth- + -ylidene.  "Oenanth-" comes from the Greek "oinanthe", referring to the vine blossom, due to the wine-like smell of oenanthol (from which oenanthylidene is derived). "-ylidene" is a suffix used in organic chemistry to denote a bivalent radical.
