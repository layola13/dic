Etymology:
From labored + -ness + -'s (possessive).  "Labored" comes from the verb "labor" meaning "to work hard," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "labor" meaning "work, toil, hardship." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. The final "-'s" indicates possession, although its use with an abstract noun like "laboredness" is somewhat unusual and might be considered non-standard in some contexts. It suggests the laboredness *of something*, though that something is not explicitly stated.
