词源： "Over-" (prefix meaning "excessive") + "soap" (noun).  The word is a relatively modern formation, likely arising in the mid-20th century with the increased availability of soap and detergents.  It initially referred to the literal overuse of soap, but the figurative meaning of overdoing or exaggerating something developed soon after.
