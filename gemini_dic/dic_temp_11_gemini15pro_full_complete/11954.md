ETYMOLOGY->
"Art house" is a compound word combining "art" and "house". "Art" in this context refers to fine arts, implying a higher artistic value and a focus on aesthetic or intellectual qualities rather than commercial appeal. "House" refers to a building used for a specific purpose, in this case, a cinema. The term originated in the mid-20th century, reflecting the emergence of cinemas specializing in showing films outside the mainstream Hollywood system.
