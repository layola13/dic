counterimage:/ˈkaʊntərɪmɪdʒ/ | n. |反像，逆像，原像|A counterimage in mathematics, specifically in set theory, refers to the set of all elements in the domain of a function that map to a given subset of the codomain.  It's essentially the "pre-image" or the set of inputs that produce a specific set of outputs.| The counterimage of the interval [1,4] under the function f(x) = x^2 is [-2,-1]∪[1,2]. 函数 f(x) = x^2 在区间 [1,4] 上的反像是 [-2,-1]∪[1,2]。|synonym: preimage, inverse image | antonym: image (in some contexts) | noun
