词源：
From Old French *loial (Modern French loyal), from Latin lēgālis “legal, pertaining to the law,” from lēx (genitive lēgis) "law." The semantic shift occurred in Medieval Latin, and the word was borrowed into English in the late 14th century.  The meaning shifted from "law-abiding" to "faithful to one's obligations," then to "faithful to a person or cause."
