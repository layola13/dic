ETYMOLOGY->
The phrase "honest-to-goodness" likely originated in the early 20th century in American English. It combines the adjective "honest" with the phrase "to goodness," which itself is an intensifier suggesting sincerity or truthfulness. The phrase "to goodness" likely stems from religious exclamations like "for goodness' sake" or "thank goodness," where "goodness" represents God or a higher power.  Over time, the phrase "honest-to-goodness" became a common idiom to emphasize the genuine nature of something.
