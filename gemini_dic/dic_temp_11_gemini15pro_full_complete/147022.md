PHRASE->

(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's difficult to construct natural-sounding phrases with such a strong and specific adverb.  Here are a few examples, but they might sound contrived in real-life conversation.)

She whispered overlasciviously in his ear.  她在他耳边淫荡地低语。

词源: From "over" + "lascivious" + "-ly". "Lascivious" comes from Late Latin "lascivus," meaning playful or wanton.  "Over-" intensifies the meaning.
