Etymology->
Acronym derived from "autonomous sensory meridian response."  "Autonomous" refers to self-governing or independent. "Sensory" relates to the senses. "Meridian" originally referred to lines of longitude and has been repurposed to describe pathways in the body. "Response" indicates a reaction to a stimulus.  While the term is relatively new (coined in 2010), the sensations it describes have likely been experienced for much longer.
