ETYMOLOGY->
From Spanish *buscar* "to seek, look for," from Vulgar Latin *buscare*, frequentative of Latin *boscus* "forest, wood" (source of French *bois* "wood").  Originally, the word referred to searching for firewood or game in the woods.  The meaning shifted to "seek business" and then to "perform in public for money."
