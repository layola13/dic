注意事项:  While "fasciitis" itself is a noun, the plural form "fasciitises" as presented in the prompt, is not commonly used. Medical professionals typically refer to multiple instances of fasciitis in different locations, like "He has fasciitis in both feet." or specify the type of fasciitis, such as "plantar fasciitis and Achilles fasciitis."
