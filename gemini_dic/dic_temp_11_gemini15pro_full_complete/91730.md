PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Hyperdelicately" is not typically used in set phrases.  It's a descriptive adverb that modifies verbs, and its meaning is quite specific, making it less versatile for phrase formation.


词源:  "Hyper-" (Greek, meaning "over, beyond") + "delicately" (from "delicate," ultimately from Latin "delicatus," meaning "delightful, alluring, dainty").
