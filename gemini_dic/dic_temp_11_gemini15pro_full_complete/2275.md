注意事项:  "adeno" itself isn't typically used alone outside of forming compound words.  It primarily serves as a prefix. This makes providing antonyms and synonyms for "adeno" alone difficult, as its meaning is dependent on the word it's attached to.  This response provides near synonyms for the combined words rather than "adeno" specifically. It also does not have a direct antonym.
