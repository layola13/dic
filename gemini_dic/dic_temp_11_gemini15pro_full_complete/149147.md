##oxidulated:  详细解析ɪtɪd/ | adj. | 氧化过的；被氧化的| 含有氧化物的；被氧化作用处理过的 |  Oxidulated is an uncommon word, particularly in casual conversation. It means something has undergone oxidation,combining with oxygen. This can refer to a chemical process where a substance loses electrons, or more simply, reacts with oxygen. The resulting substance often has altered properties.  | The oxidulated copper looked dull and greenish.  被氧化的铜看起来暗淡发绿。 The water was slightly oxidulated due to the presence of iron.  由于铁的存在，水略微被氧化。 |oxidized, oxygenated | reduced (反义词并非完全对等，因为“还原”是氧化的逆反应，但并不总是简单的反义)directly from the word "oxide."  "Oxide" itself originates from the French word "oxyde," which in turn is built from the Greek words "oxys" (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed," and  "eidos," (εἶδος) meaning "form" or "kind."  The "sharp" connotation likely refers to the acidic properties of many oxides.  The suffix "-ulated" indicates a process or state of being affected or treated with something, in this case, oxidation.synonyms like "oxidized" or "oxygenated."  Its usage is largely restricted to scientific or technical contexts where a specific nuance is needed.  While "oxidized" simply implies a reaction with oxygen, "oxidulated" might suggest a less complete or a more subtle oxidation process.  However, the distinction isoften not strictly enforced, and the words are often used interchangeably.cleaned by a chemical solution. 金属被氧化的表面被一种化学溶液清洗干净。onyms):**of oxygen.provides analogous examples to the user's request.)一层绿色的铜绿。(Copper *is* oxidized to form...)sample has been oxidizing slowly in the lab. 样本在实验室里缓慢氧化了很长时间。过去进行时 (Past Continuous):**before I arrived. 我到达之前，铁已经氧化了。几天了。quickly in this environment. 在这种环境下，这种金属会很快氧化。一个星期内会缓慢氧化。掉。。
