ignitability:/ɪɡˌnaɪtəˈbɪləti/| n. |可燃性，易燃性|The quality of being ignitable; capable of being set on fire.|The ignitability of dry leaves makes them a fire hazard. 干树叶的可燃性使它们成为火灾隐患。|近义词：flammability, combustibility|反义词：non-flammability, incombustibility|词性:noun
Etymology: From ignite (v.) + -able (suffix) + -ity (suffix).  Ignite comes from the Latin "ignire" meaning "to set on fire."
