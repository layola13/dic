词源: From Old French *doctor (“teacher, learned man”), from Latin doctor (“teacher, instructor”), agent noun from docēre (“to teach”), from Proto-Indo-European *deḱ- (“to show, point out, teach”).  The meaning "medical professional" arose in the Middle Ages, as the highest academic degree was that of doctor of medicine.
