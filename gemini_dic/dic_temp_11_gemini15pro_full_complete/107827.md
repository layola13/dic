larboard: /ˈlɑːrbərd/ (historical) | adj. n. |左舷的，左舷|The larboard side of a ship is the left-hand side when you are facing forward.  船的左舷是当你面向前方时的左侧。|The ship listed to larboard. 船向左舷倾斜。|近义词: port (现代用法) |反义词: starboard|词性: adjective, noun

Etymology:
From Middle English *laddeborde, from lade ("to load") + bord ("board, side of a ship").  The "l" in "larboard" could be easily confused with the "s" in "starboard," especially in windy conditions, leading to its eventual replacement with "port."  源自中古英语 *laddeborde，由 lade（“装载”）+ bord（“木板，船侧”）组成。“larboard”中的“l”很容易与“starboard”中的“s”混淆，尤其是在有风的情况下，最终导致其被“port”取代。
