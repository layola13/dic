The word "agees" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling of "agrees," "ages," or perhaps intended as a plural of "agee" (a now-obsolete word meaning "to agree").  I will provide information for "agrees" and "ages," as these are the most probable intended words.

**agrees:**

/əˈɡriːz/ | v. | 同意，一致 |  To have the same opinion or feeling as someone else; to say yes to a suggestion or request. | He agrees with me on most things. 他在大多数事情上都同意我的看法。 |  She agreed to help us with the project. 她同意帮助我们完成这个项目。 | synonyms: concurs, assents, consents | antonyms: disagrees, dissents, objects | verb

**ages:**

/ˈeɪdʒɪz/ | n. (plural) | 很长时间，很久 |  An informal way of saying a very long time.  Can also be the plural of "age" referring to periods of history or the length of time someone has lived. | It's been ages since I've seen her. 我很久没见到她了。 | The Dark Ages were a period of great upheaval.  黑暗时代是一个动荡不安的时期。 | synonyms: eons, a long time, forever | antonyms: briefly, shortly, a short time | noun (plural)
