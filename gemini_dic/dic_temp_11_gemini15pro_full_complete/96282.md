词源: "Indiest" is the superlative form of "indie," which is short for "independent."  The term "independent" has its roots in the Latin word "independens," meaning "not dependent."  In the context of music, film, and art, "indie" began to be used in the late 20th century to describe works created outside of major commercial labels or studios.
