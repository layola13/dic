词源: From Latin *arbitrarius*, from *arbiter* "judge, witness," from *ad-* "to" + *baetere* "to come, go." The sense evolution is from "depending on the judgment of an arbiter" to "decided by one's liking" (1580s), to "capricious, tyrannical" (1640s), to "undetermined, indifferent" (mathematics, 1710).
