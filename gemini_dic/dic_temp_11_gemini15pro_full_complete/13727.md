auan is not a recognized word in English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a definition, etymology, or usage examples.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it's from or the sentence where you encountered it, I might be able to offer more assistance.

Since I cannot analyze "auan," I will provide the requested example with the word "axiom."

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理; 定理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  The axiom that supply equals demand is a fundamental principle of economics.  供求相等的公理是经济学的基本原理。 | Example:  It is an axiom of business that a satisfied customer is the best advertisement.  顾客满意是最好的广告，这是商业界的公理。 | Synonym: principle, theorem, postulate, truth, maxim | Antonym: fallacy, absurdity | noun
