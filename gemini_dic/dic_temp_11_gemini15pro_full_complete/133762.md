nongaseousnesses:/ˌnɒnˈɡeɪsiəsnɪsɪz/ | n. | 非气态 | The state or quality of not being gaseous.  Lack of gaseous properties or characteristics. |  The nongaseousnesses of the substance allowed it to be transported easily.  这种物质的非气态特性使其易于运输。 | solidity, liquidity | gaseousness | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
non- (prefix):  From Latin *non "not".
gaseous (adjective): From gas + -eous (suffix forming adjectives). "Gas" ultimately derives from Greek *khaos "empty space, vast chasm".
-ness (suffix):  Forms nouns expressing state, quality, or condition.
