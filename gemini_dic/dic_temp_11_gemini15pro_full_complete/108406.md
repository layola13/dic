词源: law (n.) + making (from make (v.))

Old English lagu "regulation, rule prescribed by authority, ordinance, district governed by the same laws," from Old Norse *lagu "law," collective plural of lag "layer, stratum, measure, stroke, beat" (related to the verb leggja "to lay, to lie"), from Proto-Germanic *lago (source also of Old Frisian lag "law," Middle Dutch lach "layer, course," Old High German lag "deposit, store," German Lage "situation, position").
Making comes from the Old English verb macian "to make, form, produce, do, perform, cause, bring about; to compose (poetry); to earn, gain," from Proto-Germanic *makon (source also of Old Saxon makon, Old Frisian makia, Old High German mahhon, German machen "to make," Gothic gamotan "to assemble").
