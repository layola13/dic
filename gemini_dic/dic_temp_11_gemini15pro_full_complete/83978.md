half-critical:/ˌhæf ˈkrɪtɪkəl/ | adj. | 半临界的 |  Relating to a state or condition that is halfway to a critical point, often used in technical contexts like physics or engineering, where a system's behavior changes dramatically.  It implies being close to, but not yet at, a critical threshold. | The reactor is in a half-critical state, requiring careful monitoring.  反应堆处于半临界状态，需要仔细监测。

The temperature is half-critical, meaning we need to reduce the heat immediately. 温度处于半临界状态，这意味着我们需要立即降低热量。 | near-critical, subcritical | supercritical | adjective
