PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases.  "Inset" is more commonly used as a noun, referring to a smaller thing placed inside a larger one. Therefore, phrases using "insetted" as a verb are less frequent.)


注意事项:

While "insetted" is grammatically correct, "inserted" is generally preferred and more commonly used.
