ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *limnen*, from Old French *luminer* "to illuminate, brighten,"  from Latin *illuminare* "to light up, enlighten," from *in-* "in, on" + *lumen* "light".  The sense shifted from "illuminating a manuscript with miniatures" to "painting miniatures" and then to "painting" and "describing" in general.
