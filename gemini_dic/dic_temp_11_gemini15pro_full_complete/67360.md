extensionalism:/ɪkˈstɛnʃənəlɪzəm/ | n. | 外延主义 | The philosophical position that the meaning of a concept is determined solely by its extension, i.e., the set of things to which it applies. | Example: Extensionalism holds that "creatures with a heart" and "creatures with kidneys" have the same meaning if all creatures with a heart also have kidneys, and vice versa.  外延主义认为，如果所有有心脏的生物都有肾脏，反之亦然，“有心脏的生物”和“有肾脏的生物”这两个概念的含义是相同的。| Example: In extensionalism, two concepts are considered identical if they refer to the same set of objects or entities. 在外延主义中，如果两个概念指涉同一组对象或实体，则它们被认为是相同的。 | Synonym:  None (highly specific philosophical term) | Antonym: intensionalism | Noun
