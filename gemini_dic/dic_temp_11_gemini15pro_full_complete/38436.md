From Late Middle English *concerten, from Anglo-Norman concerter, contenter, from Medieval Latin concertare “to contend, dispute, arrange, settle, agree upon,” from Latin concertare “to strive together, contend,” frequentative of certāre “to contend, struggle, vie,” from certus “settled, determined.”  The meaning shifted from "contending" to "arranging together" over time.
