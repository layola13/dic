geosynchronous:/ˌdʒiːoʊˈsɪŋkrənəs/
adjective
地球同步的
Relating to a satellite that orbits the Earth at the same rate as the Earth rotates, so that it appears to remain stationary over a fixed point on the Earth's surface.
A geosynchronous satellite stays above the same spot on Earth.  地球同步卫星停留在地球上方的同一个地点。
The company launched a geosynchronous communications satellite.  该公司发射了一颗地球同步通信卫星。
Near Synonyms: geostationary
Antonyms: N/A (There isn't a direct antonym for a technical term like geosynchronous.  One could perhaps use "non-geosynchronous" or describe a different type of orbit.)
Part of Speech: Adjective
