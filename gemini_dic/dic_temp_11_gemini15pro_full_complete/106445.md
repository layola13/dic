kosing:/ˈkoʊzɪŋ/| n. |亲吻; 爱抚; (尤指动物的)轻咬; |The act of kissing, cuddling, or gently biting, especially between animals.

Etymology:  Likely derived from "cose" (meaning to converse or chat intimately), which in turn comes from the Middle English "cosen," ultimately from the Old French "cunter" (to tell).  The shift in meaning towards physical affection likely occurred due to the close proximity and gentle touches involved in intimate conversation.
