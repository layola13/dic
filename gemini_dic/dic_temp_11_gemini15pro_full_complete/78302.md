germogen:/ˈdʒɜːrmədʒən/| n. |萌发层; 芽殖体|A layer of meristematic cells  beneath the palisade layer of certain lichens from which soredia are produced.  Also known as algal layer, gonidial layer.  It is a layer of algal cells in a lichen thallus.|The  germogen plays a crucial role in the lichen's reproductive cycle, producing soredia that can disperse and form new lichens.|Synonyms: algal layer, gonidial layer|Antonyms: N/A|Noun
