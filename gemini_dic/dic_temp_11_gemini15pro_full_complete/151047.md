`/ˌpærəfaɪˈmoʊsɪs/ | n.| 包茎嵌顿 | paraphimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is retracted and cannot be returned to its normal position, leading to swelling and pain.  This is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention. Ittypically occurs when the foreskin is retracted (e.g., for cleaning) and then cannot be pulled back over the glans penis. The trapped foreskinconstricts blood flow to the glans, causing swelling and potential tissue damage if left untreated.  Treatment usually involves manual reduction (carefully moving the foreskin back into place) or, in more severe cases, surgical intervention such as circumcision. | The patient presented with paraphimosis, characterized by a swollen and edematous glans penis with a tightly retracted foreskin.  He reported severe pain and was unable to manually reduce the foreskin himself. |  phimosis (the inability to retract the foreskin) |  not applicable (opposite conditions relate to foreskin movability, not the *condition* of paraphimosis itself) | 名词`meaning "beside," "beyond," or "abnormal.".  It implies the foreskin *was* retractable at one point, but is now stuck in a retracted position.colloquially or figuratively.  When discussing the condition, it's crucial to use precise and accurate medical terminology to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals.  The severity of paraphimosis can range from mild discomfort to severe pain and potentially tissue necrosis (death of tissue) if left untreated.  Prompt medical attention isessential to avoid complications.。)'t a perfect synonym for paraphimosis, terms like "strangulated foreskin" or "constricted foreskin" can sometimes be used in clinical settings to describe the condition's presentation, emphasizing the constriction aspect.  However,  "paraphimosis" remains the most precise and medically accepted term.not directly opposite *condition*.  Paraphimosis is a complication *of* a previously retractable foreskin.
