From "melt" + "down". "Melt" comes from Old English "meltan," meaning "to dissolve, to make or become liquid." "Down" comes from Old English "dūn," meaning "from a higher to a lower place."  The combined meaning initially referred to the literal melting of a substance, particularly in industrial processes.  The figurative sense of a catastrophic collapse or emotional outburst developed later.
