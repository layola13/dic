The word "femerell" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or any known historical or dialectal sources. Therefore, it's impossible to provide a legitimate etymology, definition, or usage examples. It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a highly specialized or fictional context.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer more information.

Since I cannot analyze "femerell," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "axiom."
