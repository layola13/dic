nondisinterested:/ˌnɒndɪsˈɪntrəstɪd/ | adj. | 无私的，公正的；并非不感兴趣的 | Not disinterested; having a personal interest or stake; biased.  Showing interest or concern. |  The judge was nondisinterested in the case, as his brother was one of the defendants. 法官对这个案子并非不感兴趣，因为他的兄弟是其中一个被告。

Her nondisinterested look suggested she might have more than a professional interest in the project. 她并非不感兴趣的表情表明她对这个项目可能不仅仅是出于职业兴趣。 | 近义词: interested, concerned, biased, partial, prejudiced | 反义词: disinterested, impartial, unbiased, neutral | 词性: adjective

词源:  Formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the word "disinterested" (meaning "impartial, unbiased").  The word "disinterested" itself comes from "dis-" (meaning "not") and "interested."  Thus, "nondisinterested" effectively cancels out the double negative, creating a positive meaning of having an interest.
