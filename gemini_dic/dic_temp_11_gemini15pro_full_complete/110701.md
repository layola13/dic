linearized:/ˈlɪniəˌraɪzd/| adj.|线性化的，线性化的|Made or treated as linear, especially by approximation.|The linearized model of the system is easier to analyze.  该系统的线性化模型更容易分析。|The graph shows the linearized data. 这张图表显示了线性化后的数据。|近义词：linear, simplified|反义词：nonlinear, complex|词性:形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From linear + -ize + -ed.  Linear comes from the Latin word "linearis" meaning "of or belonging to a line."  The suffix "-ize" forms verbs meaning "to make or become," and "-ed" forms the past participle, creating an adjective.
