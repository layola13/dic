isometric-projection:/ˌaɪsəˈmɛtrɪk prəˈdʒɛkʃən/
n.
等轴测投影，等角投影
A method of visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions in technical and engineering drawings, where all three axes are equally foreshortened, resulting in angles of 120 degrees between them.  This creates a pictorial drawing that appears three-dimensional but without perspective, meaning parallel lines remain parallel and do not converge.
The architect used an isometric projection to show the client how the building would look.  建筑师使用等轴测投影向客户展示建筑物的外观。

The isometric projection clearly illustrated the complex assembly of the engine.  等轴测投影清晰地展示了发动机的复杂装配。

近义词: axonometric projection, isometric drawing
反义词: perspective projection
词性: noun

词源:  From iso- (Greek: "equal") + metric (Greek: "measure") + projection (Latin: "throwing forward").
