Etymology:
The origin of "crackajack" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the late 19th century in American English. One theory suggests it's a combination of "crack" (meaning "expert" or "first-rate") and "jack" (a common term for a man). Another proposes a connection to the game of cribbage, where "jack" is a valuable card.
