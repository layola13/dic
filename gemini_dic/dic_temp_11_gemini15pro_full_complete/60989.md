词源: Possibly coined from elements suggesting "delight" or "bliss" (e.g., "elide" suggesting smoothness and pleasure) combined with a suffix like "-or" or "-dor" often used in place names.  Its precise origin is uncertain. However, the word gained popularity through Alan Garner's children's fantasy novel *Elidor* (1965).
