movabilities:/ˌmuːvəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可移动性，移动能力 | The movabilities of the furniture allowed for easy rearrangement of the room.  家具的可移动性使得房间很容易重新布置。|  The movabilities of the new robot are impressive. 新机器人的移动能力令人印象深刻。 |  mobility, portability, transportability | immobility, fixity | noun

Etymology:  From "movable" + "-ity" (suffix forming abstract nouns) + "-es" (plural suffix). "Movable" comes from "move" (from Old French "mover," ultimately from Latin "movēre," meaning "to move") + "-able" (suffix meaning "capable of being").
