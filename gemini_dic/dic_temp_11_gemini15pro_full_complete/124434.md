注意事项:

"Motorial" is not a common word in modern English.  While grammatically correct and understandable, "motor" or other more specific terms related to movement or engines are generally preferred.  For example, instead of "motorial skills," one would typically say "motor skills."  Instead of "motorial function," one might use "motor function," "locomotive function," or a more precise term depending on the context.  If referring to something related to an engine, "motor" or a more technical term would be more appropriate.
