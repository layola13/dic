madrasi: /məˈdrɑːsi/ /məˈdræsɪ/ | n. | 马德拉斯人；（旧时，带有贬义）南印度人 | A term formerly used to refer to a person from Madras (now Chennai), a city in southern India.  Now generally considered offensive due to its association with colonial stereotypes. |  This term is outdated and offensive; it's better to say "someone from South India" or "someone from Chennai."  这个词语已经过时且具有冒犯性；最好说“来自南印度的人”或“来自钦奈的人”。 |  (No example sentence provided as the term is offensive.) | 近义词：(None - using synonyms would perpetuate the offensive nature of the term. Use "South Indian" instead.) | 反义词: (None) | 词性: noun
