ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *aimer (Modern French esmer), from Late Latin *aestimāre "to estimate, appraise," frequentative of Latin aestimāre "to estimate, value, rate," from aes "bronze, money" (from Proto-Italic *aes, from Proto-Indo-European *h₂es- "copper, bronze") + -timāre (from Proto-Indo-European *-tīm- "price"). The sense shifted from "estimate" to "intend" in Old French.
