athalamous: /əˈθæləmʌs/ | adj. | 无花托的，无托的 | Lacking a thalamus or receptacle, especially of a flower; having no receptacle.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe flowers where the floral parts are attached directly to the stem, without an intervening receptacle. |  Example 1: The athalamous flower lacked the typical swollen tip where the petals and other floral parts would normally attach. 这朵无托花缺少通常附着花瓣和其他花卉部分的肿胀尖端。

Example 2: Some primitive plant families exhibit athalamous flowers, a characteristic considered evolutionarily ancient. 一些原始植物科展示出无托花，这被认为是进化上古老的特征。 | Near synonyms: sessile (when referring to the attachment of floral parts), receptacle-less | Antonyms: thalamiflorous, having a receptacle | 词性: adjective
