词源:  "nonsanenesses" is derived from "nonsaneness," which is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to "saneness." "Saneness" itself comes from "sane," which ultimately has its roots in the Latin word "sanus" meaning "healthy" or "sound." The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "sane" into the noun "saneness," and the suffix "-es" pluralizes it to "nonsanenesses."
