Note:  While "crampet" is used in American English, it is often confused with "crumpet."  In British English, a "crumpet" is distinct from a "crampet" and has a more distinct holey texture.  In American English, "crampet" is often used to refer to a larger, thinner pancake-like item similar to an English muffin.
