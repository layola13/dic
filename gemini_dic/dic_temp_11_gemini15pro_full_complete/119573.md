PHRASE->
(This word is not typically used in common phrases.  It's a technical term.  Therefore, providing phrases using the word itself feels forced and unnatural.  Instead, here are phrases related to the *concept* of microvilli, which might be more useful in context.)

1. intestinal absorption = 肠道吸收
2. nutrient uptake = 营养吸收
3. cell surface area = 细胞表面积
4. brush border membrane (where microvilli are found) = 刷状缘膜（微绒毛所在的位置）
5. epithelial cells (cells that often have microvilli) = 上皮细胞（通常具有微绒毛的细胞）
