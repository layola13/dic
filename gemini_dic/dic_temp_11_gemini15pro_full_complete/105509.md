kilogrammetre:/ˈkɪləɡræmˈmiːtər/ | n. |千克米;公斤米| A unit of energy or work equal to the work done in raising a mass of one kilogram through a vertical distance of one metre against gravity. |  A kilogrammetre is a unit of measurement no longer commonly used. | 近义词: joule | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From kilogram + metre.  Kilogram from French kilogramme, from kilo- + gramme.  Metre from French mètre, from Greek metron "measure."

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The kilogrammetre represents a specific amount of energy. = 千克米代表特定量的能量。
It is rarely used in modern physics. = 它在现代物理学中很少使用。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Scientists are increasingly using joules instead of kilogrammetres. = 科学家们越来越多地使用焦耳而不是千克米。
Engineers are phasing out the use of this unit. = 工程师们正在逐步淘汰这个单位的使用。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The joule has largely replaced the kilogrammetre as the standard unit of energy. = 焦耳已在很大程度上取代千克米成为标准的能量单位。
Physicists have abandoned the use of kilogrammetres in most calculations. = 物理学家在大多数计算中已经放弃使用千克米。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Researchers have been exploring more practical units of energy for decades. =  几十年来，研究人员一直在探索更实用的能量单位。
They have been gradually transitioning to the joule. = 他们一直在逐渐过渡到焦耳。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Engineers often used the kilogrammetre in the past. = 工程师过去经常使用千克米。
The unit served its purpose for a time. =  这个单位在一段时间内发挥了作用。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Scientists were actively seeking a more universal unit of energy. = 科学家们正在积极寻找一个更通用的能量单位。
They were moving towards the adoption of the joule. = 他们正朝着采用焦耳的方向发展。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before the joule became widely accepted, the kilogrammetre had been a common unit of work. = 在焦耳被广泛接受之前，千克米一直是常用的功的单位。
Scientists had already started questioning its practicality. = 科学家们已经开始质疑它的实用性。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Physicists had been using the kilogrammetre for many years before its decline. = 在其衰落之前，物理学家们已经使用千克米很多年了。
They had been searching for a more consistent system of units. = 他们一直在寻找一个更一致的单位系统。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The kilogrammetre will likely become obsolete in the future. = 千克米在未来可能会被淘汰。
Textbooks will probably mention it only for historical context. = 教科书可能只会出于历史背景提及它。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Students will be learning about joules as the standard unit of energy. = 学生们将学习焦耳作为标准的能量单位。
Scientists will be utilizing more modern units in their research. = 科学家们将在他们的研究中使用更现代的单位。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the next century, the kilogrammetre will have completely disappeared from common usage. = 到下个世纪，千克米将完全从日常使用中消失。
The joule will have become the universally accepted unit. = 焦耳将成为普遍接受的单位。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
