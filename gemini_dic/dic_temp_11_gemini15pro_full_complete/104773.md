Etymology:
From Middle English *caynard*, from Old French *caignard*, meaning "dog in the manger," from *caigner* "to hold, keep," from Latin *canis* "dog." The original sense referred to a dog that occupies a manger but doesn't eat the hay, preventing other animals from eating it. This sense evolved to describe someone who selfishly withholds resources or effort.
