词源: From the noun "cornice" + "-ed". "Cornice" comes from Italian "cornice" (framework, cornice), which itself derives from Late Latin "cornix" (curved line, cornice), ultimately from Latin "cornu" (horn). The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating possession of the quality described by the noun.
