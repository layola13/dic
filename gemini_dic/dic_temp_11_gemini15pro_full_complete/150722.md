##paracentric: /ˌpærəˈsentrɪk/ |adj. | 近中心的；旁中心的 |acentric refers to something located near or around a center, but not exactly at the center.  It's often used in scientific contexts, particularly in geneticsand cytogenetics, to describe chromosomal regions or events.  A paracentric inversion, for example, is a type of chromosomal rearrangement where a segment of achromosome is inverted, but the centromere (the central point of the chromosome) is not included within the inverted region.  In other fields, it might describe something situated around a central point of interest.The study focused on the paracentric regions of the chromosome, analyzing gene expression in the areas surrounding the centromere.  这项研究集中在染色体的近中心区域，分析中心粒周围区域的基因表达。The satellite, though orbiting the planet, maintained a paracentric position, never quite aligning directly with the equatorial plane.  尽管卫星绕行星运行，但它保持着近中心的位置，从未完全与赤道平面对齐。closer proximity to the center than "paracentric"), circumcentric, adjacent"near", or "alongside") and the word "centric" (referring to a center).  "Centric" itself comes from the Greek word "kentron," meaning "center" or "point."  Therefore, "paracentric" literally means "near the center" or "beside thecenter."to properly understand its intended meaning. For instance, understanding the meaning in a discussion about genetics differs greatly from its meaning in geology or astronomy.
