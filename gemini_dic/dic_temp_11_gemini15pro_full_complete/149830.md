It includes the study of fossils to determine the organisms' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments.  Paleontologists use a variety oftechniques, including geological and chemical methods, to study these remains and interpret the history of life on Earth.  The field encompasses a wide variety of specializations, from studying microscopic fossils (microfossils) to the largest dinosaurs.  Discoveries in paleontology often contribute to broader scientific fields, such as evolutionary biology and geology.极大地促进了古生物学领域的发展。)前生物学)"ancient" or "old"during the 19th century as the field itself became more formally established.  Early researchers, often geologists who encountered fossils in their work, gradually developed dedicated methodologies and theories to understand the ancient life they unearthed. The development of evolutionary theory in the mid-1800s profoundly impacted paleontology, providing atheoretical framework to interpret the fossil record and understand the history of life's diversification.research findings related to fossils and ancient life.  It may also be used as an adjective, as in "paleontological evidence" (古生物学证据).  There are related terms like "paleontologist" (古生物学家), the person who studies paleontology.
