ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek ostrakon "shell, potsherd," specifically a piece of pottery used for voting to banish someone.  The practice in ancient Athens was to write the name of the person to be ostracized on a piece of pottery (ostrakon) and then cast it into an urn.  If enough votes were cast against an individual, they were exiled for a period of time.
