Etymology:
From concerned + -ness + -'s.  "Concerned" comes from the past participle of the verb "concern," which originates from the Old French "concerner" and ultimately from the Latin "concernere" meaning "to sift together," later evolving to mean "to be of importance to."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. The final "-'s" is the possessive marker in English.
