PHRASE->
(No commonly used phrases incorporate "exhibitionistically" directly.  It's an adverb that describes *how* an action is performed, rather than forming a core part of a set phrase.  It would be unusual to encounter set phrases with this word.)

词源: From exhibitionist + -ically.  Exhibitionist comes from the Late Latin exhibition- (from exhibere ‘exhibit’) + -ist.
