The suffix "-itious" is commonly used to create adjectives implying a connection to or characteristic of a noun. Therefore, "pactitious" originally described something *pertaining to an agreement*. Over time, however, its meaning shifted to carry a negative connotation, suggesting agreements that are deceptively artificial or insincere. This semantic shift reflects a common linguistic process where a originally neutral term develops negative implications through usage."pactitious" emphasizes the artificial or insincere nature of an agreement or action. It implies a degree of deception, suggesting that the surface appearance of the agreement masks an underlying reality or ulterior motive. The word tends to be used in formal contexts and often implies a subtle form of manipulation or dishonesty.  It indicatesthat something isn't natural, genuine, or straightforward, but instead contrived for a specific purpose, often to present a false impression of harmony or cooperation." specifically relates to agreements or deals, highlighting the lack of genuine agreement behind the surface.  "Contrived" might describe an artificial situation in general, and "artificial" suggests something lacking naturalness, but "pactitious" pinpoints the disingenuousness within a formal arrangement.**径，他虚假的道歉听起来空洞无物。Specious:** Appearing to be plausible but actually fallacious..
