hyperinvolutions:/ˌhaɪpərɪnvəˈluːʃənz/ | n. | 超对合 | A hyperinvolution is a mapping from a set to itself such that applying it twice yields the identity mapping, and some additional conditions are satisfied depending on the context. In projective geometry, a hyperinvolution is an involution of a projective space whose fixed points form a subspace of codimension two.  |  The study of hyperinvolutions plays a significant role in projective geometry. | 近义词: involution (in some contexts) | 反义词: N/A | noun
