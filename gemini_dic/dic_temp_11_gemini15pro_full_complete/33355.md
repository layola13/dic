ETYMOLOGY->

The origin of "chump" is uncertain, but it's believed to have emerged in the late 19th century, possibly from British slang.  One theory suggests it might be related to "chunk," implying a piece or lump, perhaps referring to a blockheaded person.  Another possibility is a connection to the word "chomp," suggesting someone easily chewed up or taken advantage of.  The verb "chumped" is simply the past participle form of "chump" used as a verb, meaning "treated like a chump."
