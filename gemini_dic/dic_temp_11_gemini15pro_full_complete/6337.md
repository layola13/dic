amperage:/ˈæmpərɪdʒ/ | n. |电流强度；安培数 |The strength of an electric current expressed in amperes. |The amperage of the circuit was too high for the thin wiring. 电路的电流强度对于细电线来说太高了。| synonyms: current, current strength | antonyms: None | noun

Etymology: From ampere + -age.  "Ampere" is named after André-Marie Ampère, a French physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetism.  "-age" is a suffix forming nouns denoting an aggregate, collection, or quantity.
