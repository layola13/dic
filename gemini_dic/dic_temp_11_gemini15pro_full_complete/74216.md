fourthest: /ˈfɜːrðɪst/ | adj. | 最远的 |  This word is considered nonstandard or dialectal. The standard superlative form of "far" is "farthest." It means at or to the greatest distance. | Example: He claimed he'd walked the fourthest of anyone. 他声称自己走得比任何人都远。(Non-standard usage) | farthest, furthest | nearest, closest | adjective
