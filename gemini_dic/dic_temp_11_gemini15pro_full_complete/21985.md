bohrium:/ˈbɔːriəm/| n.|钅波|A synthetic radioactive element with the symbol Bh and atomic number 107.  It is named after Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist.  Bohrium is extremely radioactive and its most stable known isotope has a half-life of approximately 1 minute.  It is not found naturally on Earth and is only produced in laboratories.|Bohrium is a transuranium element. 钅波是一种超铀元素。|Synonyms:  transuranium element (more general)|Antonyms: N/A (Bohrium is a specific element, not a concept with an opposite)|noun
