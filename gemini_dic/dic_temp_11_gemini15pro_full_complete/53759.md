词源:
From Old French desconfit, past participle of desconfire  "to defeat, rout,"  from des- "opposite of" (see dis-) + confire "to prepare, accomplish," from Latin confirmare "to strengthen, establish" (see confirm). The original meaning was "to defeat utterly, rout," which shifted to "to frustrate the plans of" and then, by the 16th century, to "to throw into a state of confusion and embarrassment."
