词源：

"Lyerman" isn't a standard English word. It appears to be a colloquial or informal variant of "liar," likely formed by combining "liar" with "man."  The suffix "-man" is often used to create nouns referring to a person who performs a particular action or has a particular characteristic (e.g., milkman, salesman).  While not incorrect per se in informal contexts, it's nonstandard and "liar" is the preferred and accepted term.  There's no established etymology for "lyerman" as it's not a recognized dictionary word. The etymology of "liar," however, comes from Old English "lēogan" (to lie), from Proto-Germanic "*leugan."
