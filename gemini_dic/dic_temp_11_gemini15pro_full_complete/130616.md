nonadiabatic:/ˌnɑːnˌeɪdiəˈbætɪk/ | adj. | 非绝热的 |  Relating to or involving a process or system in which energy is transferred as heat.  A nonadiabatic process is one that occurs so quickly or violently that there is not enough time for the system to remain in thermal equilibrium. | The nonadiabatic reaction is crucial in many chemical processes.  非绝热反应在许多化学过程中至关重要。 | Near-adiabatic, diabatic | Adiabatic | adjective
