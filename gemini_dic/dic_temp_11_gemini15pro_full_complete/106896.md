laccolith:/ˈlækəlɪθ/ | n. | 岩盖，岩盘 | A mass of igneous rock, typically lens-shaped, that has been intruded between rock strata causing uplift in the shape of a dome. |  Example 1: The geologists discovered a large laccolith beneath the sedimentary layers.  地质学家在沉积层下面发现了一个巨大的岩盖。

Example 2:  The formation of the mountain range was partly due to the uplift caused by a laccolith.  山脉的形成部分是由于岩盖引起的隆起。 | synonym:  dome, sill, intrusive, pluton | antonym:  N/A (Geological formations don't typically have direct opposites.) | noun

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Example 1: The laccolith was forming when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. 岩盖形成时，恐龙在地球上漫游。
Example 2: The ground was being uplifted as the laccolith grew. 随着岩盖的生长，地面正在被抬升。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Example 1: The laccolith had formed before the area was eroded. 在该地区被侵蚀之前，岩盖已经形成。
Example 2:  The magma had already intruded when the earthquake occurred.  地震发生时，岩浆已经侵入。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Example 1:  The laccolith had been growing for centuries before it was discovered. 岩盖在被发现之前已经生长了几个世纪。
Example 2: The magma had been pushing upwards for a long time, forming the laccolith. 岩浆一直向上推了很长时间，形成了岩盖。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Example 1: Geologists will study the laccolith further. 地质学家将进一步研究岩盖。
Example 2:  Erosion will eventually expose more of the laccolith.  侵蚀最终会暴露出更多的岩盖。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Example 1:  Scientists will be studying this laccolith for years to come. 科学家们将在未来几年内研究这个岩盖。
Example 2:  Geologists will be analyzing the rock samples from the laccolith. 地质学家将分析来自岩盖的岩石样本。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
Example 1: By next year, the team will have completed their research on the laccolith. 到明年，该团队将完成他们对岩盖的研究。
Example 2: By the end of the decade, scientists will have learned much more about the formation of laccoliths. 到本世纪末，科学家们将对岩盖的形成有更多的了解。
