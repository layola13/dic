PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases in modern English due to its offensive nature.  It's generally replaced by less offensive terms.)
However, historically, phrases like "feebleminded person" or "care for the feebleminded" were used.  These are now outdated and considered inappropriate.  It's better to use phrases with more respectful and accurate terminology such as "person with intellectual disabilities" or "support for individuals with intellectual disabilities."
