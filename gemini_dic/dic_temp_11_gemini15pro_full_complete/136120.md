nonredundant:/ˌnɒn.rɪˈdʌn.dənt/| adj.|非冗余的，不重复的|Containing no redundant or unnecessary elements; concise and efficient.  Removing any nonredundant data from the system is crucial for efficiency.|The engineer designed a nonredundant system, ensuring every component had a unique and essential function.|近义词：concise, succinct, essential, necessary, efficient|反义词:redundant, superfluous, unnecessary, verbose|词性:形容词
Etymology:  From non- + redundant.  "Redundant" comes from Latin *redundant- (stem of redundans), present participle of redundare "to overflow," from re- "back, again" + undare "to surge, overflow," from unda "wave."
