Etymology:  The origin of "jamins" is uncertain, but it's likely derived from rhyming slang or backslang.  One theory suggests a connection to "jamin jar," rhyming with "car," which could have extended to represent money needed to buy a car. Another possibility is a link to "German," perhaps rhyming with "earn," implying money earned.
