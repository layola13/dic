注意事项:
"hospitablenesses" is a less common plural form of "hospitality."  It's more natural and frequent to use "hospitality" in both singular and plural contexts.  While grammatically correct, "hospitablenesses" might sound slightly archaic or overly formal in modern usage.  It might be used to emphasize distinct acts of hospitality, rather than the general concept.
