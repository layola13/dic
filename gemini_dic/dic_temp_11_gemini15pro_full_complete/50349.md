depolarization:/diːˌpoʊləˌrɪˈzeɪʃən/
noun
去极化，除极
The process of reducing or eliminating polarization, especially of a nerve cell membrane.
Depolarization of the neuron triggers the release of neurotransmitters.  神经元的去极化触发神经递质的释放。
Synonyms:  stimulation, excitation
Antonyms:  hyperpolarization, repolarization
