nonequilibria:/ˌnɒn.iːkwɪˈlɪbriə/ | n. | 非平衡状态 |  A state in which a system is not in equilibrium, meaning opposing forces or influences are not balanced. | The researcher studied the complex dynamics of nonequilibria in ecological systems.  研究人员研究了生态系统中非平衡状态的复杂动力学。| synonyms: imbalance, instability, disequilibrium | antonyms: equilibrium, balance, stability | noun

nonequilibrium:/ˌnɒn.iːkwɪˈlɪbriəm/ | adj. | 非平衡的 | Not in a state of equilibrium. |  The nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the system were complex.  该系统的非平衡热力学很复杂。| synonyms: unbalanced, unstable | antonyms: balanced, stable, equilibrium | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + equilibrium.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "equilibrium" comes from Latin "aequilibrium," from "aequus" (equal) + "libra" (balance).
