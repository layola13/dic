Etymology:
From dis- (expressing negation, reversal) + worth.  The prefix "dis-" comes from Old French des-, dis- and ultimately from Latin dis- meaning "apart, asunder, in different directions, between, away from, not."  "Worth" comes from Old English weorþ, wurþ "worthy, of value, deserving of; of value equivalent to," from Proto-Germanic *werthaz (source also of Old Saxon werd, Old Frisian werth, Dutch waard, Old High German werd, German wert "worth," Old Norse verðr "price, worth," Gothic wairþs "worthy").
