This stems from the verb "paraballein" (παραβάλλειν), meaning"to compare" or "to place side by side." The mathematical concept of a parabola emerged from the geometrical study of conic sections – curves created by slicing a cone with a plane.  The  name "parabola" in mathematical contextreflects the relationship between the curve and a directrix and focus (a point and line defining the curve).  Over time, the term evolved to describe anything resembling a parabola in shape., a symmetrical U-shaped curve. This is most frequently seen in mathematical and scientific contexts when describing trajectories (like that of a projectile under gravity), the shape of certain antennas,  or other curved forms. The word isn't typically used in everyday conversation  but appears in technical writing, engineering, and physics,among other fields.  While "parabolic" is more commonly used, "parabolical" is a valid and understood synonym.提供了一个坚固而优雅的结构。). (天线的抛物面反射器有效地聚焦无线电波。)parabolical** arc.
