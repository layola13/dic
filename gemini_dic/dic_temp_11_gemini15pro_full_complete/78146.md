geophysical:/ˌdʒiːəʊˈfɪzɪkəl/
adjective|地球物理学的|Relating to the physics of the earth and its environment, including the study of the earth's shape, its magnetic and gravitational fields, its internal structure and composition, and its atmosphere and oceans.|例句：Geophysical surveys are used to explore for oil and gas. 地球物理勘探被用于石油和天然气的勘探。

例句：Geophysical data helps us understand earthquakes. 地球物理数据帮助我们理解地震。|近义词：geological, earth science|反义词: N/A|词性: adjective

Etymology:
From geo- "earth" + physical "relating to physics."  "Geo-" comes from the Greek word "gē" meaning "earth." "Physical" comes from the Greek "physikos" meaning "of nature."
