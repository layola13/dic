ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin conversari "to live with, keep company with," from Latin conversus, past participle of convertere "to turn around, turn back, be changed," from com- "together" (see com-) + vertere "to turn" (from PIE root *wer- (2) "to turn, bend"). The meaning "to hold intercourse, commune" developed in Late Latin.
