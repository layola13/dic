endosmotic:/ˌɛndoʊzˈmɒtɪk/ /ˌɛndoʊzˈmɑːtɪk/
adjective
内渗的
Relating to or involving endosmosis; characterized by the inward passage of a fluid through a semipermeable membrane toward a fluid of higher concentration.
The endosmotic pressure caused the cell to swell. 内渗压导致细胞膨胀。
近义词: inward-osmotic
反义词: exosmotic
词性: adjective

词源:  From endo- + osmotic.  "Endo-" is a Greek prefix meaning "within" or "inner." "Osmotic" relates to osmosis, the process of fluid passing through a semipermeable membrane.
