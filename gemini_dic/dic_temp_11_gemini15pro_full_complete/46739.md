词源:  From the verb "dandle," which comes from  the Middle English "dandlen,"  frequentative of "dan," meaning "to lift up and down."

注意事项: "dandlers" as a noun referring to people is less common than "dangler," which can refer to both objects and people. The word often carries a negative connotation, suggesting idleness or lack of purpose.  While the verb "dandle" usually refers to gently moving something up and down, "dandler" as a noun has evolved to mean someone who is idle or unproductive.
