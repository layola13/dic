mislayers:/mɪsˈleɪərz/
|n.|错误分层，错位层|The mislayers in the rock formation made it difficult to determine its age. 岩层中的错位层使得难以确定它的年代。|The geological survey revealed several mislayers, indicating past seismic activity. 地质调查揭示了几个错位层，表明过去的地震活动。|近义词: dislocations, misalignments|反义词: alignments, proper layering|词性:名词

词源: "mis-" (prefix meaning wrong, bad, or wrongly) + "layer" (n.) + "-s" (plural suffix).  From the verb "mislay" which means to put something in a place and then forget where it is.  "Mislayer" is a less common back-formation, treating "mislay" as if it were formed from "mislayer."
