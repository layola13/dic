词源:  From the verb "drub" + "-er" (agent suffix). "Drub" comes from Middle English "drubben," of uncertain origin, possibly related to Old Norse "dryppa" (to drip) or Dutch "droppen" (to drop, drip).  The original meaning likely referred to beating or thrashing, and the sense of rubbing developed later, perhaps through the image of repeated blows.
