ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *lapicida* ("stone-cutter"), from *lapis* ("stone") + *-cida* (agent suffix, "killer of, cutter of"),  from *caedere* ("to cut, to kill").  The word was likely formed by analogy with words like *homicide* and *suicide*.  However, the meaning shifted to specifically refer to the killing of rabbits, possibly due to a misunderstanding or a humorous application of the term.
