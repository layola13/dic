The word "hangley" is not a standard English word. It likely doesn't have a formal dictionary entry, nor established usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "gangly" which means awkwardly tall and thin.
2. **A neologism:** A newly coined word, possibly slang or jargon used within a specific group.
3. **A proper noun:**  A name of a person, place, or thing.

If you can provide more context on where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more insight.

However, assuming you meant "gangly", here's the analysis:

gangly: /ˈɡæŋɡli/ | adj. | 瘦长的；细长的；笨手笨脚的 | Tall, thin, and awkward in movements. |  He was a tall, gangly youth. 他是一个瘦高而笨拙的年轻人。 | He has long, gangly legs. 他有着修长笨拙的双腿。 |  lanky, spindly | sturdy, robust | adjective
