Etymology:
From "over-" (excessively) + "licentious" (disregarding accepted rules or conventions, especially in sexual conduct) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Licentious" itself comes from the Latin "licentiosus" (unbounded, unrestrained), from "licentia" (freedom, license), related to "licere" (to be permitted).
