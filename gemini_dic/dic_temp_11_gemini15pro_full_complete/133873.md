nongravities: /nɒnˈɡrævɪtiz/ | n. | 非引力，非重力 |  Forces or phenomena that are not related to gravity; things not subject to the force of gravity.  This word is not commonly used and is likely a neologism formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "gravities". | The scientist was studying the nongravities affecting the spacecraft's trajectory. 科学家正在研究影响航天器轨迹的非引力。| The experiment was designed to isolate the nongravities influencing the particles. 这个实验旨在隔离影响粒子的非引力。 | Near synonyms:  non-gravitational forces, other forces, external forces | Antonym: gravity, gravitational forces | Noun
