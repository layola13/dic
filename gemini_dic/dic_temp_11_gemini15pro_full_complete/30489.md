centrolineal:/ˌsɛntroʊˈlɪniəl/
adjective
中心线的；共线的
Relating to or based on a centroline (a line connecting the centers of two figures).  Specifically, in geometry, figures are centrolineal if the centers of the figures and the centers of similitude are collinear.
The two circles are centrolineal because their centers and their center of similitude lie on the same line. 这两个圆是共线的，因为它们的圆心和它们的相似中心在同一条线上。
