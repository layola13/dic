词源:  "co-ordinatenesses" is derived from "coordinate" (from Latin "co-" meaning "together" and "ordinatus" meaning "arranged"), with the suffix "-ness" indicating a state or quality.  The plural form is used less frequently and can sound somewhat awkward; "coordinate systems" or similar phrases are often preferred.
