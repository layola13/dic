ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of the name "Idaho" is uncertain.  A popular but unsubstantiated theory claims it comes from a Shoshone word meaning "gem of the mountains." However, most scholars now believe the name was fabricated by lobbyist George M. Willing.  When he proposed the name for a new territory in the Rocky Mountains, Congress rejected it.  Later, when Colorado Territory was formed, the name was resurrected and applied to a portion of that territory, which eventually became the state of Idaho.
