nondistributive:/ˌnɒndɪˈstrɪbjʊtɪv/ | adj. |非分配的，不可分配的 |  Not distributive; not following the distributive law of logic or mathematics.  This means that the operation cannot be applied separately to each member of a group and then combined. | The operation of averaging is nondistributive over addition.  平均运算对加法是非分配的。

The property of being non-commutative is nondistributive over addition. 不交换的性质对于加法是非分配的。 | 近义词: non-distributive | 反义词: distributive | 词性: adjective
