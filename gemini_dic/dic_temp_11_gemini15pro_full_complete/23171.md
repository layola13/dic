词源:  "Bow" and "scrape" are both old words with Germanic origins. "Bow" refers to bending at the waist, while "scrape" refers to the dragging of one's foot as a gesture of deference, a custom dating back to at least the 17th century.  The two words combined emphasize the exaggerated and often insincere nature of the subservient gesture.
