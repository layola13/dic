##paraform: 详细解析/` | n. | 副醛 |  Paraformaldehyde is a polymerof formaldehyde. It is a white crystalline powder that is soluble in water and alcohol. It is used as a disinfectant, preservative, and in the manufacture of plasticsand resins.  | 例句：Paraformaldehyde is used as a biocide in many applications.  （副醛在许多应用中用作杀生物剂。） Paraformaldehyde is a precursor to various other chemicals. （副醛是各种其他化学物质的前体。）| 近义词：formaldehyde (甲醛) (但paraformaldehyde是甲醛的聚合物，并非完全等同)| 反义词：无直接反义词, often implying a position next to or alongside.  "Formaldehyde," the root word, is a compound composed of a single carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and singly bonded to two hydrogen atoms ($H_2CO$). The "para" prefix in this case doesn't suggest isomerism in thechemical sense, but rather refers to its being a polymeric form of formaldehyde.slow release of formaldehyde allows paraformaldehyde to act as an effective disinfectant and preservative. This is particularly relevant in biological and medical applications, for example, preserving biological specimens.formaldehyde, handling is generally safer and easier than using pure formaldehyde gas or liquid.现在时 (Simple Present):**are currently investigating new applications of paraformaldehyde. （研究人员目前正在研究副醛的新应用。）to preserve specimens. （几十年来，科学家们一直使用副醛来保存标本。）experimenting with paraformaldehyde for several months. （研究团队几个月来一直在对副醛进行实验。）used paraformaldehyde as a key reagent. （实验使用副醛作为关键试剂。）formaldehyde was releasing formaldehyde gas. （加热时，副醛正在释放甲醛气体。）the experiment began, they had prepared the paraformaldehyde solution. （实验开始前，他们已经准备好了副醛溶液。）。)long time before developing new applications. (在开发新的应用之前，该团队长期以来一直在他们的实验中使用副醛。)order more paraformaldehyde next week. （他们下周将订购更多副醛。）pm tomorrow, we will be analysing the results obtained with paraformaldehyde.
