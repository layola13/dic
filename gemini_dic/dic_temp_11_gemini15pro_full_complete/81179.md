词源: From the practice of "grandfather clauses" in the American South after the Civil War, which exempted people whose grandfathers had voted before 1867 from literacy tests and other voting restrictions, effectively disenfranchising Black voters.  The term has since broadened to mean any exemption from new rules based on pre-existing status.
