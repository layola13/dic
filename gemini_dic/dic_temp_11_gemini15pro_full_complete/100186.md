词源:  From inter- + relation.  "Inter-" is a Latin prefix meaning "between," "among," "mutually," "reciprocally." "Relation" comes from the Latin "relatio," meaning "a bringing back, restoring," also "a telling," hence "account, narrative, proposition, proposal," from "referre" ("to carry back").  Therefore, "interrelation" literally signifies the act of bringing things back or connecting them to one another mutually.
