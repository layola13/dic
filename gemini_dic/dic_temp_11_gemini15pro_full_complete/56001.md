Etymology: "Do" is a common Germanic verb meaning "to perform or execute." "By" is a preposition indicating the agent or means of an action.  The combination "do by" likely evolved from its more literal meaning of "performing an action towards someone" to the more idiomatic sense of "treating someone in a particular manner."
