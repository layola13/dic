##paracyanogen:/ˌpærəˈsaɪənədʒən/ | n. | 拟氰 |  A brown, amorphous polymericsolid formed by heating cyanogen. Its exact structure is still debated. | Paracyanogen is insoluble in common solvents and decomposes at high temperatures. |暂无近义词 | 暂无反义词 | 名词"para-" and "cyanogen".a specific isomeric arrangement. In this context, it likely highlights the structural difference between paracyanogen and other forms of cyanogen polymers.cyanide group, -CN) and "-gen" (meaning “producing” or “forming”).  Cyanogen itself is a highly toxic, colorless, flammable gas with the chemical formula C₂N₂.ogen, which produces or generates [a polymeric] substance".and potential applications.  Research into paracyanogen focuses on its peculiar polymeric structure and potential applications in materials science, though such applications are not yet widely established.观察到拟氰的形成。)of ongoing research.  Unlike cyanogen which has a simple linear structure, paracyanogen is a complex polymer that is likely comprised of CN units which form a intricate polymeric network.  The ambiguity of its structure hinders its wider application.  It's often described as an amorphous solid, indicating a lack of long-range order in its atomic arrangement. More research is needed to fully elucidate its structure and properties.
