词源：From Old French deschanter "to sing, chant," from des- "down" (expressing removal, reversal) + canter "to sing."  Initially referred to a fixed part sung ex tempore against the plainchant, later broadened to mean any counterpoint or melody sung above the plainsong.  Eventually came to mean discourse or comment elaborately.
