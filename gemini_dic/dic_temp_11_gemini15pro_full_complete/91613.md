hyperapophysis:/ˌhaɪpərəˈpɒfɪsɪs/
n.|过度生长突起，上突，上骺|A bony process or outgrowth, especially a prominent process on the dorsal (upper) side of a vertebra in some animals. It provides attachment points for muscles and ligaments.|The dinosaur's hyperapophysis provided strong support for its powerful back muscles.|近义词:process, outgrowth, apophysis|反义词:(No direct antonym, could consider concavity/depression)|词性:noun


Etymology:
From Greek *hyper* "over, above" + *apophysis* "offshoot, outgrowth"  *apo* "off, away from" + *physis* "growth, nature"
