词源:  "Kick-ass" originated as slang, likely emerging in the mid-20th century. It combines the verb "kick" (meaning to strike with the foot) with "ass" (buttocks), implying a forceful and decisive action that overwhelms or defeats.  Over time, the term evolved to describe something exceptionally good or impressive.
