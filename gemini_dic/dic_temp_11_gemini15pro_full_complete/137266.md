nonsymmetric:/ˌnɒn.sɪˈmetrɪk/ /ˌnɑːn.səˈmetrɪk/| adj.|非对称的，不对称的|Not symmetric; lacking symmetry.  Having parts that fail to correspond to one another in shape, size, or arrangement; lacking symmetry.|The artist intentionally created a nonsymmetric painting to evoke a sense of imbalance.|近义词：asymmetric, asymmetrical, dissymmetric, unsymmetric, unsymmetrical|反义词:symmetric, symmetrical|词性:形容词
Etymology: non- + symmetric.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "symmetric" comes from the Greek "symmetria," meaning "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement."
