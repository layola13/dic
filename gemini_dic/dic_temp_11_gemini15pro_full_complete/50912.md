PHRASE->
(Not applicable - "deservers" is not typically used in set phrases. It's a fairly formal noun.)


词源: From the verb "deserve" + "-er" (suffix forming agent nouns). "Deserve" comes from Old French "deservir" meaning "to merit, be worthy of." Ultimately from Latin "deservire"  "to serve well, be worthy of."
