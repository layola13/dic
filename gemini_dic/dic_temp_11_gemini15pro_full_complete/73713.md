The correct spelling is **Fourier**, referring to Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician and physicist.  The word "Fourier" itself is most often used as an adjective related to his work.

Fourier: /ˈfʊrieɪ/ (US), /ˈfɔːrieɪ/ (UK)| adj.| 傅里叶的 | Relating to the mathematical methods or theories developed by Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, especially his series and transform.| The Fourier transform is a powerful tool in signal processing. 傅里叶变换是信号处理中的强大工具。| 近义词:  (No direct synonym for the adjective itself, but related terms include "spectral," "harmonic") | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
Derived from the surname of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830).
