PHRASE->
N/A ( "oe" is a grapheme, not a word and doesn't form phrases.)

注意事项:  "oe" itself is not a word but a digraph/ligature representing a vowel sound, most commonly /oʊ/ as in "foe" or /ɜː/ (British English) as in "oedema".  It is becoming increasingly archaic and often replaced with simply "e".  Therefore, providing examples of phrases, antonyms, or a verb form is not applicable.
