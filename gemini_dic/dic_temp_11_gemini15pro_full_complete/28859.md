Etymology:
From "carpetbag," a type of traveling bag made of carpet fabric, common in the 19th century.  The term became associated with Northerners who traveled South after the Civil War, often carrying their belongings in these bags.  Because some of these individuals were perceived as exploiting the South's postwar instability for personal gain, the term "carpetbagger" acquired a negative connotation.
