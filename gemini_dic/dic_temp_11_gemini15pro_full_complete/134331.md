noninsulators:/ˌnɒnˈɪnsjʊleɪtəz/ | n. | 非绝缘体 | Materials that do not effectively prevent the flow of heat or electricity.  They readily conduct or transmit energy. | Copper wires are good noninsulators, efficiently carrying electricity. 铜线是很好的非绝缘体，能有效地传输电力。| Metals are typically noninsulators. 金属通常是非绝缘体。 | 近义词: conductors | 反义词: insulators | 词性: 名词

词源:
"Non-" (prefix):  From Latin "non" meaning "not." 表示“不”。
"Insulator": From Late Latin "insulator" meaning "one who isolates," from "insulare" meaning "to make into an island," from "insula" meaning "island."  绝缘体来源于拉丁语，意思是“隔离者”，来自“使成为岛屿”，来自“岛屿”。
