ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *bale, from Frankish *balla (“ball”). Related to Old High German balla (“ball”).  The meaning shifted from "ball" to "bundle" due to the rounded shape of a bale. The verb sense of "to bail water" is likely a separate development, from Old French baille (“bucket”).  The archaic meaning "woe, misery" is from Old Norse böl (“evil”).
