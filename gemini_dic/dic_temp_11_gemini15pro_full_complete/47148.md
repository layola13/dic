The word "davs" is not a standard English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it might be slang, an abbreviation, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, what was being discussed), I might be able to offer more help.


However, since the prompt requests information on the format and grammar explanations, I will demonstrate with the word "what" which is commonly used and allows for showcasing the requested grammatical structures.
