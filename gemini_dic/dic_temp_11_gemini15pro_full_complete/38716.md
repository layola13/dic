词源：
From Late Latin *condimentarius (source of Old French condimant, condiment "spice, seasoning"), from Latin condimentum "spice, seasoning, sauce," from condire "to season, preserve, pickle," from com- "together" (see com-) + -dere, combining form of dare "to give" (from PIE root *do- "to give").

注意事项:  "condimentary" is less common than "condiment".  While both relate to seasoning, "condiment" refers to the seasoning itself (noun), while "condimentary" describes something related to or used as a condiment (adjective).
