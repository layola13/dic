ETYMOLOGY->
From fish + wife + -s (plural).  "Fishwife" dates back to the late 15th century, originally literally referring to women who sold fish. The pejorative sense of "loud, abusive woman" developed by the mid-17th century, likely due to the stereotypical image of market women engaging in boisterous arguments.
