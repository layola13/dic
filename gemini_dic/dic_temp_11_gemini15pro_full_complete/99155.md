Etymology:
From interchangeable + -ness. Interchangeable is from inter- + change + -able.  "Inter-" comes from Latin, meaning "between" or "among." "Change" comes from Old French "changier," ultimately from Latin "cambiare," meaning "to barter" or "exchange." "-able" is a suffix meaning "capable of being." "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
