gastrula:/ˈɡæstrʊlə/| n. |原肠胚|An early multicellular animal embryo, composed of three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) from which the various organs and tissues later differentiate.|The gastrula stage is crucial for the development of the nervous system.| synonym: germ layer stage| antonym: blastula| noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Modern Latin gastrula, diminutive of Greek gaster ("stomach, belly").  The term was coined by Ernst Haeckel.
