nonrelativity:/ˌnɒnˌrɛləˈtɪvɪti/ | n. |非相对性|The state or quality of not being relative; the absence of relativity.|  Classical physics deals with nonrelativity, where time and space are absolute.| 近义词: absoluteness | 反义词: relativity | 词性: 名词

词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "relativity" (from "relative" + "-ity").  "Relative" ultimately comes from Latin "relativus," meaning "having reference or relation."
