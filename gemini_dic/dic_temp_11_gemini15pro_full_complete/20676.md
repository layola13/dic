词源:  "Blackwash" originates from the term "whitewash," which originally referred to a mixture of lime and water used to whiten walls.  The term "whitewash" later acquired the figurative meaning of covering up or glossing over faults or blemishes. "Blackwash" emerged as an antonym, implying a deliberate attempt to darken or tarnish someone's reputation or to suppress unfavorable information.
