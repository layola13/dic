ETYMOLOGY->
culture (n.) + shocked (adj.)
"culture" comes from Latin "cultura" meaning "cultivation, agriculture," figuratively "care, culture, refinement."
"shocked" comes from the past participle of "shock," which originates from the Old French "choquer" meaning "to clash, collide." The meaning evolved to include emotional disturbance caused by a sudden event.
