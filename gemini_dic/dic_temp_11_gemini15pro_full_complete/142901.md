词源:  "out-" (outside) + "pension" (from Old French "pension," ultimately from Latin "pensio" - payment, especially for lodging). Originally referred to a boarding house or lodgings, later evolving to mean a fixed sum paid regularly.  In the medical context, "out-pension" or "out-patient" refers to a patient who receives treatment without staying overnight, thus "outside" the regular "pension" or lodging of the hospital.
