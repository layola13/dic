ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *druncnian, frequentative of *drincan "to drink," from Proto-Germanic *drenkanan "to give to drink, make wet" (source also of Old Frisian drenka, Old Saxon drinkan, Old High German trinkan, German trinken "to drink," Old Norse drekka, Gothic drigkan), from PIE root *po(i)- "to drink."  The sense evolution is from "to give to drink" to "to drench, soak" to "to drown."
