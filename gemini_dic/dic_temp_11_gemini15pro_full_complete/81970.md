grindability's:/ˌɡraɪndəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可磨性，磨碎性 | The grindability's of different materials varies greatly. 不同材料的可磨性差异很大。 |  例句：The coal's grindability's was tested before use.  这种煤在使用前进行了可磨性测试。 | 近义词：crushability, pulverizability | 反义词: hardness, solidity | 词性: 名词

词源: grind (v.) + -able (suffix) + -ity (suffix) + -'s (possessive suffix)

"Grind" comes from Old English "grindan," meaning "to crush by friction."  "-able" forms adjectives meaning "capable of being." "-ity" forms nouns indicating a state or quality.  "-'s" indicates possession. Thus, "grindability's" refers to the quality or state of being capable of being ground, belonging to something.
