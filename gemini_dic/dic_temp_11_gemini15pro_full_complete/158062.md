##plasmic:/ˈplæzmɪk/ | adj. | 血浆的；等离子体的；原生质的 |  与等离子体或原生质相关的；类似等离子体的  |  The experiment involved creating a plasmic discharge.  (实验包括产生等离子体放电。)| 近义词：plasma-related, plasmatic | 反义词：solid, crystallineGreek word "πλάσμα" (plasma), meaning "something molded" or "something formed".  This root reflects its use in biology to describe the cytoplasm – the jelly-like substance within a cell – and in physics to denote plasma, a state of matter composed of ionized gas. The suffix "-ic" is added to create an adjectival form indicating a relationship or resemblance to the base word.serves as an adjective, qualifying nouns related to plasma or protoplasm. Its usage is largely confined to scientific and technical contexts, especially in biology, physics, and related fields.cell. For example, "plasmic membrane" refers to the cell membrane.

However, "plasmic" can beused for emphasis or where the context demands an adjectival form.原文例句，补充更多例句以展现不同用法):**人员观察到藻类细胞中快速的原生质流动。)extreme conditions.
