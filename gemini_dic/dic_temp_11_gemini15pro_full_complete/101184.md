The word "invile" is likely a misspelling of "invite".  Assuming this is the case, the following analysis pertains to "invite":

A request or enticement to participate or attend.|  I invited her to my birthday party. 我邀请她参加我的生日派对。 |  He extended an invite to the opening night. 他发出了开幕之夜的邀请。| synonyms:  summon,  request,  ask,  bid | antonyms:  exclude,  reject,  banish | verb, noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *inviter (Modern French inviter), from Latin invitāre (“to invite, summon, entertain”), frequentative of in- (“in, on, upon”) + vitāre (“to avoid, shun”).  The semantic shift from "avoid" to "invite" likely occurred through the idea of "calling someone *in*".
