balminess's:/ˈbɑːminəsɪz/| n.|温和的气候，宜人的气候|The balminess's of the evening air was a welcome change after the scorching heat of the day.  傍晚温和的空气是白天酷热之后令人欣喜的变化。|英文解析:  The noun "balminess" refers to a pleasantly mild and warm quality, typically of the air or weather.  The addition of "'s" indicates the possessive form, although it's grammatically unusual and generally avoided. It implies the balminess *belonging* to something, which is conceptually awkward. A better phrasing would almost always be available. |例句：The balminess of the evening invited us to sit outside. 傍晚宜人的气候让我们想坐在外面。

The balminess of the air made the walk very enjoyable.  温和的空气使散步变得非常愉快。
