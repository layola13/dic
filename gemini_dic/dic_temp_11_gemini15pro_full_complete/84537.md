This term is now outdated and considered inaccurate and potentially offensive due to its association with racial classifications and colonial ideologies.  It grouped together diverse populations based on linguistic criteria, not genetic or cultural ones, and often carried racist undertones. |This term was once used to describe the Berber people of North Africa. (This usage is now outdated and problematic.)|近义词：(None - due to the outdated and problematic nature of the term, there are no suitable synonyms.  Use more specific and accurate terms like "Berber," "Cushite," "Egyptian," etc. depending on the group you're referencing.)|反义词:(None)|词性:noun
