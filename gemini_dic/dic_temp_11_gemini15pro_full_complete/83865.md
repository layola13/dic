词源：
From Middle English *halest, superlative of *hal (“hale, healthy”), from Old Norse heill (“hale, healthy, safe, sound”). Cognate with Swedish hel (“whole, entire, sound, healthy”), Danish hel (“whole, entire, healthy”), Icelandic heill (“whole, entire, healthy”), German heil (“hale, sound, whole, uninjured”). More at hale.  Essentially a double superlative, as -est was added to an already superlative word.  Now somewhat archaic.
