注意事项:

"Jaago" is a Hindi/Urdu word, not English.  This analysis assumes the intended use is within an English context, treating it as a loanword. Its use would likely be limited to specific contexts where Hindi/Urdu speakers are interacting or when discussing Indian culture.  There is no direct English equivalent that carries the same cultural nuances.
