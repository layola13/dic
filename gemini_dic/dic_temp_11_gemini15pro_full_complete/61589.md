PHRASE->

(Since "emery" is primarily used as a noun referring to the abrasive material, it doesn't have many common phrasal verb constructions.  The past participle "emeried" is even less likely to appear in set phrases.  Therefore, I'm providing examples of how "emery" could be used in short phrases, rather than true "phrasal verbs.")

emery cloth = 金刚砂布
emery paper = 金刚砂纸
emery wheel = 金刚砂轮
emery powder = 金刚砂粉
an emery board = 一个指甲锉


注意事项:
As noted above, "emeried" isn't a frequently used word.  You are much more likely to see "emery" used as a noun or in compound nouns like "emery board" or "emery cloth".
