morosoph: /ˈmɔːrəˌsɒf/ (No standard pronunciation as it's a coined word) | n. | 愚人哲學家;  自以為是的愚者;  | A person who pretends to be wise but is actually foolish; a pseudo-intellectual who lacks true understanding. | He presented himself as a great philosopher, but his arguments revealed him to be a morosoph. 他把自己塑造成一个伟大的哲学家，但他的论点表明他不过是个愚人哲學家。| Near Synonyms: charlatan, sophist, pseudo-intellectual, fraud | Antonyms: sage, wise man, scholar, intellectual | Noun


Etymology:  "Morosoph" appears to be a coined word, likely combining "moro-" (from Greek μωρός, mōros, meaning "foolish" or "stupid") and "-soph" (from Greek σοφός, sophos, meaning "wise").  This creates a paradoxical term signifying a "foolish wise person."
