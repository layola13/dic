词源： "cream cheese" is a compound noun formed from "cream" and "cheese".  "Cream" comes from the Old French "cresme" (modern French "crème"), ultimately from Latin "chrisma" meaning "unguent". "Cheese" comes from Old English "cēse", from West Germanic *kasjus, ultimately from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root *kwat- meaning "to ferment, turn sour".
