The word "mindes" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible you're thinking of a word from another language, a misspelling, or a very specialized term.  If you could provide more context (like the language it's from, or the sentence you saw it in), I can try to help further.

Since I can't analyze "mindes," I'll provide an analysis of "mind" which might be related to what you're looking for:
