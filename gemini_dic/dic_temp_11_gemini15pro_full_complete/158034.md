The suffix "-less" is a common English suffix indicating the absence or lack of something. Therefore, "plantless" literally means "without plants."  Its etymology traces directly to the Old English word "plant," related to the Latin "planta" (a sprout or cutting), and the Old English suffix "-leas," meaning "without."  The evolution of the suffix from "-leas" to "-less" reflects the natural sound changesthat occur over time in English.The word emphasizes the absence of plants, highlighting the barren or desolate nature of the location.  It's generally used in descriptive writing, scientific reports, or simply everyday conversation to convey a clear picture of a plant-free environment. The word carries with it a somewhat negative connotation, suggesting a lack of life and vibrancy usually associated with plant life.**近义词/反义词 补充说明:**"Vegetationless" is a more direct synonym but less commonly used.  The antonyms emphasize the presence and abundance of plants; "lush" particularly points to a thriving, dense vegetative environment.describe something lacking essential components or elements. However, this usage is not widely accepted and might lead to ambiguity.

Sticking to theliteral meaning of devoid of plants is generally safer.
