注意事项:

This word "campanes" is unusual in English.  It looks like a Spanish or Catalan plural of "campana" meaning "bell."  The English word is simply "bells."  The word "campanile" meaning "bell tower" is more common.  It's possible the word is used in a specific context, perhaps historical or poetic.  The word for a set of bells played musically is "carillon."  

Please double-check the context where you encountered this word.  It's possible there's a typo or misunderstanding.
