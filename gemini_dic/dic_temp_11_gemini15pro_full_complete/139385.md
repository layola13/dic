ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *observabilis*, from Latin observāre (“to observe, watch, pay attention to, keep, comply with, celebrate”) + -bilis (suffix forming adjectives meaning “capable of being, worthy of being”).  The Latin verb observāre is derived from ob- (prefix meaning “towards, against, before, over”) + servāre (“to keep, watch, guard, preserve”).
