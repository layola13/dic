词源:  "Dickey" (shirtfront) likely originated from the proper name "Dick," a common nickname for "Richard,"  possibly referring to a fashionable man named Dick who popularized the style. The meaning of "unwell" is of unknown origin. The other meanings are likely related to the shirtfront meaning, perhaps through rhyming slang or playful extensions of the term.
