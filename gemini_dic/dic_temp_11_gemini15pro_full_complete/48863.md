ETYMOLOGY->
From deformed + -ness. Deformed comes from the Old French word *deformer*, meaning "to disfigure," which in turn derives from the Latin *deformare*, from *de-* (meaning "from, away from") + *formare* (meaning "to form, shape").  The suffix *-ness* is an Old English suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, denoting a state, quality, or condition.
