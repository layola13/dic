**词源:**

"Over-" (prefix) + "brutalize" (verb)

"Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much."
"Brutalize" comes from "brutal," which originates from the Late Latin word "brutalis," meaning "of a beast," derived from "brutus," meaning "brute" or "irrational."  Therefore, "overbrutalize" emphasizes the excessive and dehumanizing nature of the brutality.
