The word "mesel" is not a standard English word.  It's possible you're thinking of a word from another language, or there's a misspelling.  If you can provide more context (e.g., the language it's from, or a sentence where you saw it used), I can give you a more accurate analysis.

Since I can't analyze "mesel," I'll demonstrate the requested format using the word "what" as an example.

what: /wɒt/, /hwɒt/ (British), /wʌt/, /hwʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 |Used to ask for information about something; used to express surprise or disbelief. |例句：What is your name? 你叫什么名字？

What time is it? 现在几点了？

近义词：which, how, |反义词: (No direct antonym for "what") | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection
