cellulosing:/ˈsɛljʊˌloʊzɪŋ/
n.|纤维素化|The process of converting into cellulose or becoming cellulose-like.|The plant undergoes cellulosing as it matures.|近义词: lignification|反义词: decomposition|词性:名词

Etymology:  From cellulose + -ing (present participle suffix). Cellulose ultimately derives from French cellule ("small cell") + -ose (suffix forming names of carbohydrates).
