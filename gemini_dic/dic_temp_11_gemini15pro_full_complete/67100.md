词源: From Late Latin *explorare, from Latin explorare  "search out, investigate," from ex- "out" + plorare "to cry out, weep, wail, beat one's breast," figuratively "lament, bewail, complain of; explore."  The original notion is of "scouting out" (a hostile force), perhaps by making noises to provoke a response.
