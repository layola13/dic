PHRASE->
None common phrases specifically use "loonier," as it's the comparative form of "loony."  Phrases are more likely to use "loony" itself, such as "go loony," "a loony bin" (slang for a mental hospital), or "drive someone loony."  "Loonier" would be used in comparisons, like "He's acting loonier than usual."
