Etymology:
From the earlier *fogie*, a retired or disabled soldier, especially one living at the Royal Chelsea Hospital, from *fog*, a shortened form of *fogram*, a kind of watch, perhaps from French *fougère*, fern (used to stop watches). The current sense likely developed from the idea of elderly pensioners being resistant to change.
