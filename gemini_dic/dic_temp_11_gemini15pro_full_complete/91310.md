hydrometric:/ˌhaɪdrəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 水文测量的 | Relating to the measurement of water, especially the flow and level of rivers and streams. | The hydrometric station collects data on river discharge. 水文站收集河流流量的数据。| Hydrometric measurements are crucial for flood forecasting. 水文测量对于洪水预报至关重要。| 近义词: water-measuring | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective

Etymology:  From "hydro-" (water) + "-metric" (measuring).  "Hydro-" comes from the Greek "hydōr" (water). "-metric" ultimately derives from the Greek "metron" (measure).
