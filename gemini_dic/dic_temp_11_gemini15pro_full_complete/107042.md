lactonic:/lækˈtɒnɪk/
adjective
内酯的; 乳酸的
Relating to or characteristic of a lactone; derived from or containing a lactone.
Lactones are cyclic esters, formed by intramolecular reaction of a hydroxyl group with a carboxylic acid group in the same molecule.  The adjective "lactonic" describes something related to or derived from these compounds.  Sometimes also used in older texts to relate to lactic acid.

The compound exhibited a distinct lactonic odor.  该化合物呈现出明显的内酯气味。

The lactonic ring is easily hydrolyzed. 内酯环很容易水解。


synonym:lactone-like
antonym:(No direct antonym.  Could consider "acyclic" if referring to the ring structure, or name the specific non-lactonic compound being compared.)
词性:adjective
