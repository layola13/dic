The word "marata" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It might be:

* A misspelling of another word.
* A regional or dialectal word.
* A proper noun (e.g., a place name or surname).
* A technical term in a specific field.
* A newly coined word.

If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, the sentence it was used in, the topic of the text), I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis.

Since I can't analyze "marata", I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "what":
