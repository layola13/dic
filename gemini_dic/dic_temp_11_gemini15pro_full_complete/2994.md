aeolipile:/ˈiːəˌlɪpaɪl/ | n. |汽转球，蒸汽机|A hollow metal sphere mounted so that it can rotate, with pipes from which steam is ejected, causing it to spin; an early steam turbine.  A primitive steam engine demonstrating the principle of jet reaction.|The museum displayed a working replica of Hero's aeolipile, fascinating visitors with its spinning motion powered by steam.| 近义词: steam turbine, reaction engine | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "static engine") | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Latin *aeolipila*, from Ancient Greek *Αἰόλου πύλη* (Aíolou púlē, “gate of Aeolus (god of the winds)”).
