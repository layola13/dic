词源: From French *cynique*, or via Latin *cynicus* from Greek *kunikos* ‘dog-like, currish’, from *kuōn* ‘dog’.  The Cynics were a school of ancient Greek philosophers who believed that virtue was the only good and that its essence lay in self-control and independence.  Their austere lifestyle and contempt for conventional values led to their being likened to dogs.
