词源:  "What" comes from Old English "hwæt,"  related to other Germanic words like Old High German "hwaz."  It's an interrogative pronoun and adjective. "From" comes from Old English "fram." "A" comes from Old English "ān," meaning "one." "To" comes from Old English "tō." "Z" is the last letter of the modern English alphabet, ultimately derived from the Greek letter "zeta."  The phrase "from A to Z" likely originated by analogy to the alpha and omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, symbolizing completeness.
