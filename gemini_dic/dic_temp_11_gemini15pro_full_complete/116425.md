词源：
"Matato" is a Samoan word.  Unfortunately, further etymological breakdown is difficult to find in readily accessible resources.  It likely has roots within Polynesian languages and relates to terms for fish or methods of preparation.  More specialized research into Samoan linguistics would be required for a deeper understanding of the word's origins.
