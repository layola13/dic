This prefix is widely used to indicate a secondary or supplementary role.  The word's evolution shows its connection to concepts ofbeing alongside the main element or acting as an adjunct.  Its use in English reflects the continuation of this Latin semantic contribution, emphasizing a secondary or supporting function.to describe something that is auxiliary, subordinate, or secondary to a main or primary element. It implies a supporting role, rather than a central or primary function.  It's less common than words like "auxiliary" or "secondary," but it carries a similar meaning.
