ETYMOLOGY->
"Drive" comes from Old English *drīfan, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch drijven and German treiben.  "At" comes from Old English æt, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch and German at. The phrasal verb "drive at" emerged in the 16th century, originally meaning "to aim at" or "to strive for."  Over time, the meaning evolved to its current sense of "to hint at" or "to suggest indirectly."
