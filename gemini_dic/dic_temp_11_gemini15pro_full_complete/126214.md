my-eye:/maɪ aɪ/ | interj. |  表示怀疑、不相信、惊讶等 | An exclamation expressing disbelief, skepticism, or surprise.  | "My eye! You expect me to believe that?"  你指望我相信吗？ |  近义词:  nonsense, rubbish, baloney, my foot | 反义词:  I believe you, that's true | 词性: 感叹词

词源:
This expression likely originated in the 18th century. While the exact etymology is uncertain, one theory suggests it's a euphemism for "My God!" where "eye" replaces "God" to avoid blasphemy.  Another theory connects it to the idea of something being so unbelievable that one wouldn't believe it even if they saw it with their own eyes.
