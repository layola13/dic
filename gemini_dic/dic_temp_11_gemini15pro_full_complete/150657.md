##Pappus /ˈpæpəs/ | n. |帕普斯；(几何学)帕普斯定理|a prominent Greek mathematician and geometer.  He's best known for his contributions to geometry, specifically Pappus's theorem (also known as Pappus's hexagon theorem), a significant result in projective geometry.  The theorem states that if six points are chosen on two lines, and if the intersections of opposite sides are collinear, then the three intersections are collinear. His work,*Synagoge* (Collection), is a compilation of mathematical knowledge from earlier mathematicians, demonstrating a considerable understanding of various mathematical topics. The name is also sometimes applied to mathematical concepts directly related to his work or theorems. Outside of a strictlymathematical context the term is less common.斯定理的证明既优雅又富有洞察力。)being discussed.the collinearity of points formed by intersecting lines and their diagonals.  Its elegant formulation and profound implications have made it a subject of extensive study and generalization within the field.  The theorem holds true even when the lines are extended to infinity (considered projective lines).  Several different proofs of Pappus's theorem exist,illustrating its rich mathematical structure. It is also related to other significant geometrical results and has found applications in more modern areas of mathematics.，有助于更深入地理解"what"在不同时态中的用法：语境:**  具体的词语选择(例如使用进行时还是完成时)取决于所要表达的语境信息。 "What were you doing?"  强调过去某段时间内正在进行的动作；而 "What did you do?" 更强调过去完成的动作，无需说明持续时间。句式:**  "What" 疑问句可以与其他从句结合，形成更加复杂的句式。 例如： "What you said surprised me." (你所说的让我很惊讶。)  此处"what you said"充当主语从句。
