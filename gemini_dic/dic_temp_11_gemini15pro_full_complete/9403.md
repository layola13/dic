Note: While "antirabieses" is grammatically correct as a plural, it's more common in medical contexts to use "antirabies treatment" or "rabies prophylaxis" as singular nouns to refer to the course of treatment.  Using "antirabies" as an adjective modifying "treatment," "prophylaxis," "vaccine," or "immunoglobulin" is also very common and preferred.
