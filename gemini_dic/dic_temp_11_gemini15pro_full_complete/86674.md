ETYMOLOGY->
From "hell" + "grammite."  "Gram" comes from Greek "gramma" meaning "letter, something written,"  influenced by words like "epigram," later shortened and combined with "hell" possibly due to its fearsome appearance and powerful bite.  The connection to "grammite" is obscure and likely folk etymological.
