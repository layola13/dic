nonnattilynnesses:/ˌnɒnəˈtɪlɪnɪsɪz/ | n. |幼稚的行为，不成熟 | The state or quality of being nonnattily, characterized by childish or immature behavior.  This word is extremely rare and may be considered nonstandard. |  Due to its rarity, constructing natural examples is difficult.  A contrived example:  His nonnattilynnesses were tolerated because of his young age.  他的幼稚行为因为年纪小而被容忍了。 | 近义词: immaturity, childishness, puerility | 反义词: maturity, sophistication | 词性: noun

词源:  From nonnattily (rarely used itself) + -ness (suffix forming nouns of state or quality).  Nonnattily comes from nonnattile (not mature) + -ly (adverb suffix).  Ultimately from Latin *non natus* "not born," hence "not grown up."
