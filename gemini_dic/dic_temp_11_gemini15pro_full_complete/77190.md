词源: From Middle English *gaspen, *gaspian, *gapan, from Old Norse *gaspa (“to yawn, gape”), from Proto-Germanic *gaspōną (“to gape, yawn”). Cognate with Danish gispe (“to gasp”), Swedish gäspa (“to yawn”), Icelandic geispa (“to yawn”). Related also to Old English geāpan (“to gape, yawn”).  来自于中古英语的*gaspen, *gaspian, *gapan，源于古诺尔斯语的*gaspa（“打哈欠，张嘴”），来自原始日耳曼语的*gaspōną（“张嘴，打哈欠”）。 与丹麦语 gispe（“喘气”）、瑞典语 gäspa（“打哈欠”）、冰岛语 geispa（“打哈欠”）同源。 也与古英语 geāpan（“张嘴，打哈欠”）相关。
