ETYMOLOGY->
"off-road" combines the preposition "off" with the noun "road." "Off" indicates separation or deviation, and "road" refers to a paved way for vehicles.  The suffix "-er" added to "off-road" creates the noun "off-roader," designating a person or vehicle engaged in off-road activities. The term gained popularity with the rise of recreational four-wheel driving in the mid-20th century.
