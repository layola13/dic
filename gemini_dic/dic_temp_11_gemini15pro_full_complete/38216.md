PHRASE->
Not commonly used as a phrase in modern English.  "Comput" is somewhat archaic.  More common phrases would use synonyms like "calculate" or "figure out".


词源: From Latin computare "to count, sum up, reckon," from com- "together" (see com-) + putare "to prune, cleanse, reckon."  The original sense of "to prune" led to the idea of "clearing up accounts."


注意事项:  "Comput" is an older, less common form of "compute."  While grammatically correct, it sounds formal and somewhat archaic in modern usage.  "Compute" is the preferred and more common form in contemporary English.
