chemotype:/ˈkɛmɪˌtaɪp/
noun
化学型
A chemically distinct entity in a plant or other organism, characterized by a specific combination of secondary metabolites.
Plants of the same species can exhibit different chemotypes, leading to variations in their medicinal properties.
近义词:phenotype, biotype
反义词: (No direct antonym exists, perhaps consider "genotype" as a contrasting concept related to genetic makeup rather than chemical expression)
词性:n.

Etymology:  "chemo-" (from Greek *khēmeia* meaning "alchemy") + "-type" (from Greek *typos* meaning "impression, mark, type")
