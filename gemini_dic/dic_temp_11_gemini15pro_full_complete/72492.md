fluorescence:/flʊəˈrɛsəns/ /flɔːˈres(ə)ns/| n.|荧光|The emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.  It is a form of luminescence.  The emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. |The mineral exhibited a bright green fluorescence under UV light.  这种矿物在紫外线下呈现出明亮的绿色荧光。|luminescence, glow, radiance|absorption, darkness|noun
