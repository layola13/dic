furfuran:/ˈfɜːrfjʊˌræn/ /ˈfɜːrfjʊˌrɑːn/
n.|呋喃|A colorless, volatile, flammable liquid, C₄H₄O, used in organic synthesis and as a solvent.|Furfural is derived from furfuran.|近义词: tetrahydrofuran (THF) (as a solvent)|反义词: None|词性: noun

Etymology:  From German *Furfuran*, from *Furfural* + *-an*. Furfural is from *furfur* ("bran") (from Latin *furfur*) + *-al* (aldehyde suffix).  The furan ring structure itself is named after the Latin word for bran.
