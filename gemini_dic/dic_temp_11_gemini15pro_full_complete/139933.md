PHRASE->

modernize the equipment = 使设备现代化
popularize a new trend = 推广新的潮流

注意事项:
- "-ize" is the more common spelling in American English.  British English often uses "-ise."  Both are generally considered correct.


Since "-ize" is a suffix and not a word itself, concepts like synonyms, antonyms, and direct translations don't apply in the same way as they would for a standalone word.  Its meaning is dependent on the word it's attached to.
