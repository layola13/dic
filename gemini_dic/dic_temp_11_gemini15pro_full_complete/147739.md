词源:
"Overprocrastination" is derived from the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and the verb "procrastinate." "Procrastinate" itself comes from the Latin "procrastinare," formed from "pro-" (meaning "forward") and "crastinus" (meaning "belonging to tomorrow"). So, the original meaning was "to put off until tomorrow."
