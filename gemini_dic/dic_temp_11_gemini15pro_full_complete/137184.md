ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + sufferable.  "Sufferable" comes from the Middle English *sufferable*, from Old French *sofrable*, from Late Latin *sufferabilis*, from Latin *sufferre* "to bear, endure."  The prefix "non-" simply negates the meaning, creating "nonsufferable."  Adding the suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "nonsufferable" into the noun "nonsufferablenesses," indicating the state or quality of being nonsufferable.
