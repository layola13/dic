注意事项:  "bregmatic" is not commonly used outside of specialized medical contexts.  While grammatically correct in the examples, using simpler terms like "crown of the head" or "top of the skull" may be more appropriate in everyday communication.  Likewise, "bregma" is a more technical term, and simpler descriptions might be preferable depending on the audience.
