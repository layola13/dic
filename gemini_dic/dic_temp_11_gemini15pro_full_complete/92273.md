hyperviscosity:/ˌhaɪpərˌvɪsˈkɒsɪti/ /ˌhaɪpərˌvɪsˈkɑːsɪti/ | n. | 高黏度，高黏滞性 |  The state of being excessively viscous; abnormally increased viscosity of a fluid, especially blood.  This can lead to impaired blood flow and various health complications. |  The patient's symptoms suggested hyperviscosity syndrome.  病人的症状表明是高黏滞综合征。

Hyperviscosity of the motor oil made it difficult to start the engine in cold weather. 天气寒冷时，机油的高黏度使得发动机难以启动。

| 近义词: thickness, high viscosity | 反义词: fluidity, low viscosity | 词性: noun


Etymology:
hyper- (Greek): prefix meaning "over, excessive, beyond"
viscosity (Latin):  from "viscosus" meaning "sticky, glutinous"
