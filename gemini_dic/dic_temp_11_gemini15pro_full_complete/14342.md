automorphism:/ˌɔːtəˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 自同构，自守变换 | An isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.  A structure-preserving mapping from a set to itself. | Example:  A rotation of a square is an automorphism of the square. 正方形的旋转是正方形的自同构。

Example: An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. 图的自同构是保留邻接关系的顶点排列。| 近义词: isomorphism (when the domain and codomain are the same), endomorphism | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology: From auto- (self) + -morphism (form).  Ultimately from Greek αὐτός (autos, “self”) + μορφή (morphḗ, “form”).
