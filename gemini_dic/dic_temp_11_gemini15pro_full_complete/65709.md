Etymology:
From Late Middle English *eventful, from event + -ful.  The plural form, eventfulnesses, is less common and formed by adding -es to eventfulness.  Event itself comes from Old French event, from Latin ēventus (“outcome, result”), perfect passive participle of ēvenīre (“to come out, happen”).
