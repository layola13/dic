词源：From Old English fæðm "outstretched arms, embrace," from Proto-Germanic *fathmaz, from PIE root *pet- "to spread, stretch." Originally a measure of length derived from the distance between a person's outstretched arms.  The verb sense developed later, from the idea of encompassing or grasping something mentally.
