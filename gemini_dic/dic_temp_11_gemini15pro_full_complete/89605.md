ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of the word "hoodoo" is uncertain, but it is likely derived from African American folk magic traditions.  It may be connected to the word "voodoo," though their practices are distinct. In geological contexts, the term likely arose through association with the strange, almost supernatural appearance of these rock formations.
