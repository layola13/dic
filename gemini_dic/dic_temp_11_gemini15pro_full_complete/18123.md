词源:
From Middle English *ben, *bene, from Old English *bēn (“prayer, request, petition, boon”), from Proto-Germanic *bōniz (“prayer, request”). Cognate with German Bitte (“request”). More distantly related to Latin precor (“I pray”).  The meaning shifted to refer to a woman, likely due to its use in affectionate or respectful address.
