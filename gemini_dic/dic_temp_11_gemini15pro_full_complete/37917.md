现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
I am considering whether he is telling the truth. = 我在考虑他是否在说实话。
She is wondering if she should go. = 她想知道她是否应该去。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
I have realized that I was wrong. = 我意识到我错了。
He has mentioned that he is leaving. = 他提到他要离开了。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
I have been thinking that I should change jobs. = 我一直在想我应该换工作。
She has been saying that she needs a vacation. = 她一直在说她需要一个假期。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
I knew that he was coming. = 我知道他要来。
She said that she would be late. = 她说她会迟到。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
I was wondering if you were free. = 我想知道你是否有空。
She was thinking that she might quit. = 她当时在想她可能会辞职。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
I had thought that he was honest. = 我原以为他是诚实的。
She had said that she would help. = 她说她会帮忙。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
I had been hoping that he would change his mind. = 我一直希望他会改变主意。
She had been saying that she wanted to travel. = 她一直说她想去旅行。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
I will tell him that you called. = 我会告诉他你打过电话了。
She will say that she is busy. = 她会说她很忙。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
I will be thinking about whether to accept the offer. = 我会考虑是否接受这个提议。
She will be wondering if she made the right decision. = 她会想知道她是否做了正确的决定。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
I will have finished reading the book before you arrive. = 在你到达之前，我就已经读完这本书了. (While "before you arrive" acts as a subordinate clause, "before" acts as a preposition/conjunction rather than a complementizer.  This sentence doesn't use a complementizer.)
By the time you call, I will have told him the truth. = 在你打电话之前，我就已经告诉他真相了。(Similar to the previous example, "by the time you call" functions as an adverbial clause and "by the time" is a conjunction, not a complementizer.)

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
I will have been working on this project for two years by next month. = 到下个月，我做这个项目就两年了。(Again, this sentence doesn't contain a complementizer. "for two years" is an adverbial phrase, and "by next month" is an adverbial phrase of time.)
She will have been studying English for five years by the time she graduates. = 到她毕业的时候，她学习英语就五年了。(This sentence also lacks a complementizer.  "for five years" and "by the time she graduates" function as adverbial phrases.)

PHRASE->
There is no common phrase specifically using the word "complementizer".  It is a grammatical term, not a word used frequently in everyday language.


注意事项:
The examples for Future Perfect and Future Perfect Continuous have been corrected to reflect the fact that they did not originally contain complementizers.  It's difficult to construct natural-sounding sentences using complementizers with these tenses. They are more common with verbs expressing mental states or communication.
