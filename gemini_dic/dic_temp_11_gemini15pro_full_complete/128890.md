ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *nemel, from Old English *nǣmel, from Proto-Germanic *namō (“I take, seize”), from Proto-Indo-European *nem- (“to take, distribute, allot”). Cognate with German nehmen (“to take”), Dutch nemen (“to take”), Latin emō (“I buy, take”).  The original sense was "quick to grasp or seize," hence "quick to understand or learn," which evolved into the modern sense of "quick and light in movement."
