hyperstatic:/ˌhaɪpərˈstætɪk/ | adj. | 超静定的，静定次数超过稳定所需次数的 | Having more supports or restraints than are strictly necessary for stability, leading to internal stresses.  A structure is hyperstatic if the number of reaction components exceeds the number of equilibrium equations available for solution. |  The bridge design was hyperstatic, incorporating redundant supports for added safety. 这座桥的设计是超静定的，包含了额外的支撑以提高安全性。

The hyperstatic frame was difficult to analyze due to the redundant members.  由于冗余构件，超静定框架难以分析。 | 近义词: indeterminate, redundant, overconstrained | 反义词: statically determinate, isostatic | 词性: adjective

词源:  From Greek "hyper-" (over, beyond) + "statikos" (causing to stand, stationary).
