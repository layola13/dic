词源:  "consumingness" derives from the adjective "consuming," which means "intensely absorbing or preoccupying."  "Consuming" itself comes from the verb "consume,"  meaning "to destroy or expend by use; to use up."  The "-ing" suffix creates a present participle, used as an adjective, and the "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, representing the state or quality of being consuming.  The final "'s" indicates possession. Therefore, "consumingness's" literally refers to the possessive form of the state of being consuming.
