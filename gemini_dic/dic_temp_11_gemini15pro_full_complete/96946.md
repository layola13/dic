词源:  Likely a modern coinage blending "in" and "eye," suggesting a look that penetrates or goes deep "into" someone's eyes.  No established etymological history exists for this word.

用法说明:
"Ineye" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism or informal term.  While understandable in context, it lacks the established usage and dictionary recognition of words like "gaze," "stare," or "scrutiny."
