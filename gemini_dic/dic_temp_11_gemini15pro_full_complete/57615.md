ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *droht (unattested) "act of drawing, pulling," from Proto-Germanic *draugiz, from *draugan "to draw, pull." Cognate with Old Norse drogt "drawing, pulling, team of animals."  The spelling with -augh- reflects a pronunciation that was standard in England until the 18th century, when the spelling -aft- became more common, especially in America.
