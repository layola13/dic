ETYMOLOGY->
From French *coupé*, past participle of *couper* "to cut," from Latin *colaphus* "a blow with the fist," from Greek *kolaphos* "a cuff, blow."  The car body style is so named because it is "cut" down (shorter) than a standard sedan.  The trophy sense comes from the idea of a large, elaborate cup with a "cut" or sculpted design.
