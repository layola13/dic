cough up phlegm = 咳出痰
clear one's throat = 清嗓子 (often precedes fleming)
spit out phlegm = 吐痰 (a more forceful action than fleming)
have a lot of phlegm = 痰很多
produce phlegm =  产生痰

注意事项:
“Fleme” is a less common variant of “phlegm.”  "Phlegm" is the preferred and more widely accepted spelling.  While “fleme” might be found in some older texts or dialects, using "phlegm" is recommended for clarity and accuracy.
