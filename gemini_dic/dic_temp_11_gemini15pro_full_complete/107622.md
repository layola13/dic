langarey is not a recognized word in English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it comes from or where you encountered it, I may be able to offer more assistance.


However, since the prompt requests examples of various grammatical structures using "what," I can provide those as requested:


/wʌt/ | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| which, who | nothing | pronoun, determiner, adverb
