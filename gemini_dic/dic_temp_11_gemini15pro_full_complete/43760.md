注意事项:

*  "Creeple" is now considered offensive and outdated.  It's better to use terms like "person with a disability" or "person with mobility impairments."
*  The informal usage of "creeple" to mean something creepy or disturbing is also becoming less common. More appropriate words like "creepy" or "disturbing" are preferred.
