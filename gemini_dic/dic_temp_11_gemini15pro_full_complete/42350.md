|n.|反适应；对抗适应|Evolutionary responses by one organism to adaptations in another organism with which it interacts, such as a predator and its prey.|Example 1: The rough-skinned newt developed potent toxins as a counteradaptation to the garter snake's resistance to less potent toxins.  粗皮蝾螈进化出了强效毒素，作为对束带蛇对弱毒素抵抗力的反适应。

Example 2: The development of camouflage in prey animals is a common counteradaptation to predation. 被捕食动物的伪装发展是一种常见的反适应捕食的策略。|Synonyms: counter-evolution, reciprocal adaptation|Antonyms: coadaptation, mutualism|noun
