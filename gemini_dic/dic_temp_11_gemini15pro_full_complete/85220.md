PHRASE->
hark back to = 回顾；追溯到
Hark! = 听！（表示引起注意）
(Generally, "hark" doesn't form many common phrases beyond "hark back to" and its interjection form.  It's more of a literary word.)


注意事项:  As noted, "hark" is somewhat archaic in modern usage outside of the phrase "hark back to."  While grammatically correct in all the examples above, it might sound unnatural in everyday conversation.
