词源:  This word appears to be a humorous or informal derivation, possibly from Italian, suggesting a playful or lighthearted approach to the state of being slightly drunk. It is not a standard Italian word and likely coined by English speakers.  It echoes Italian words ending in "-ato," which are often past participles, giving a sense of a completed action (in this case, the act of becoming slightly inebriated).
