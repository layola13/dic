ETYMOLOGY->
From hand in cap, a type of lottery or game of chance in the 17th century where players would place forfeits into a cap.  A neutral umpire would then decide the terms of exchange or handicap to equalize the chances of winning. This later evolved into the sporting sense of giving a less skilled competitor an advantage to make the contest more even.
