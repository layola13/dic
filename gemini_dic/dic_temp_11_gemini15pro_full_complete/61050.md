The word "elke" is primarily used in Dutch and Afrikaans. There's no direct English equivalent with the same range of meanings.  It can function as a pronoun, determiner, or adverb, depending on the context.  Therefore, providing a single English translation and grammatical classification is misleading.  It's best to explain its various uses within those languages.
