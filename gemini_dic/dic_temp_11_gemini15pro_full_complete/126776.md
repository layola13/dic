nanodiamonds:/ˈnænoʊˌdaɪməndz/
n.
纳米金刚石
Extremely small diamonds, typically with dimensions measured in nanometers (billionths of a meter).  They are formed through various processes, including detonation synthesis, high-pressure/high-temperature synthesis, and laser ablation.
Nanodiamonds are being researched for applications in drug delivery, bioimaging, and quantum computing. 纳米金刚石正被研究用于药物输送、生物成像和量子计算等领域。

Nanodiamonds have shown promise in targeted drug delivery. 纳米金刚石在靶向药物输送方面显示出前景。

Near synonyms:  nanocrystals, nanoparticles
Antonyms:  macrodiamonds (not a standard term, but used for contrast)
noun
