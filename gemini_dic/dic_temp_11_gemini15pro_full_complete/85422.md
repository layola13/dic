词源: From Old English *hærfest (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *harbistaz, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱerp- (“to pluck, harvest”). Cognate with Dutch herfst (“autumn”), German Herbst (“autumn”).  The original meaning was "autumn," the time of harvest, which sense is preserved in the related word "harvest-tide."  The verb sense developed from the noun.
