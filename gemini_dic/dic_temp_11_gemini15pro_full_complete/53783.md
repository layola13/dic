ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- (expressing negation, lack, or deprivation) + complexion.  The "dis-" prefix is derived from Latin, meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force. "Complexion" comes from Old French "complexion,"  ultimately from Latin "complexio" meaning "combination, connection, structure," from "complectere" "to braid or weave together."
