用法说明: "Dandy's" is the possessive form of "dandy." It is less commonly used than "dandy" itself. It can refer to something owned by a dandy or a place frequented by dandies. In the plural, "dandies" simply refers to more than one dandy.  Avoid using “dandy’s” for the plural.  The correct plural is “dandies.”
