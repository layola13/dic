词源:
Likely from the 19th-century British slang term "bludgeoner," referring to someone who carries a bludgeon (a heavy club). The meaning shifted over time to refer to someone who lives off others, possibly due to the implied threat of violence if their demands weren't met.  J.K. Rowling adopted the term for the Quidditch balls in her Harry Potter series.
