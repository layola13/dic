Etymology:
hostage (n.)  c. 1300, "person given as a pledge," from Old French hostage, ostage "hostage, lodging, guest, host" (12c., Modern French ôtage "hostage"), from Medieval Latin ostaticus "hostage, guest," from Latin hospitem (nominative hospes) "guest, host" (see host (n.1)). The -age suffix perhaps influenced by Old French usage.

-ship (suffix) Old English -scipe "state, condition of being," from Proto-Germanic *-skipiz (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian -skip, Old Norse -skapr, Dutch -schap, Old High German -scaf, German -schaft), abstract noun suffix from the stem of *skapjanan "to create, ordain, appoint" (see shape (v.)).
