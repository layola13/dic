词源:  From Late Latin *ēmotionem (nominative ēmotio) "a moving out, migration," noun of action from past-participle stem of ēmovēre "move out, remove, agitate," from ex- "out" (see ex-) + movēre "to move" (from PIE root *meue- "to push away").  The sense development in Latin appears to be from "stirring up" to "strong feeling, excitement of the mind."
