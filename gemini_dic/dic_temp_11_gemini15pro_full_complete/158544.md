##plesiohedrons 的详细解析pliːziəʊˈhiːdrɒnz/ | n. |拟正多面体 |  A plesiohedron is a polyhedron that is nearly regular, meaning its faces are nearly identical regular polygons and its anglesare nearly equal.  It differs from a regular polyhedron in that its faces are not perfectly congruent nor its angles perfectly equal, but the deviation is slight.|  The study of plesiohedrons often involves exploring the boundaries of regularity in geometric forms.  The subtle differences between a plesiohedron and a true regular polyhedron can be fascinating to examine.  | 近义词：approximate regular polyhedron | 反义词：regular polyhedron," "close to," or "almost."of these solids which are very close, but not precisely, identical to regular polyhedrons.specialized publications related to:lattice formations.vary depending on the context and the particular application. It can be defined quantitatively based on metrics comparing the angles and the side lengths of faces to those of a regular polyhedron, but these metrics may differ in different publications.在专业语境下才能更好地体现其含义。以下例句模拟了可能出现的场景。)面体，仅在二面角处观察到微小的偏差。)形式的趋势，代表着从完美的晶格对称性的转变。)symmetry.  They serve as approximations or variations of the perfect geometric forms that the regular polyhedra represent.  Studying plesiohedrons can offer insights into the stability and transitions between various crystal structures, or also offer approximate representations of regular polyhedra when high computational complexity needs to be avoided.✩如何量化“拟正多面体”与“正多面体”之间的偏差？正多面体的概念是否有应用前景？
