bioblast:/ˈbaɪəʊblɑːst/
noun
生物母体，细胞质小体
A hypothetical biological unit formerly considered to be the fundamental structural element of living matter, now understood to be equivalent to a mitochondrion.
Bioblasts were once thought to be the essential units of life. 生物母体曾被认为是生命的基本单位。
Mitochondria are now known to be the powerhouses of the cell, fulfilling the role previously attributed to bioblasts.  线粒体现在被认为是细胞的能量工厂，实现了以前归因于生物母体的作用。
Synonyms: mitochondrion, chondriosome
Antonyms: None (Since the term is obsolete and refers to something now understood as mitochondria, it doesn't have a direct antonym.)
n.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "bioblast" due to its obsolescence.  由于其过时性，没有使用“生物母体”的常见短语。
(The term is primarily found in historical scientific texts.) （该术语主要出现在历史科学文本中。）


注意事项:
Since "bioblast" is an obsolete scientific term, its usage is limited to historical contexts. 由于“bioblast”是一个过时的科学术语，它的使用仅限于历史背景。  It's important to use the modern equivalent, "mitochondrion," in current scientific discussions. 在当前的科学讨论中，使用现代等效词“线粒体”很重要。
