Words like "mujahid's" might be used in certain contexts, but it's essential to be aware of the potential political and religious implications.) | 反义词: (No direct antonym exists.  Depending on the specific interpretation of "jihad," one might consider antonyms for concepts like "war" or "struggle," such as "peace" or "surrender.") | 词性: 名词 (Possessive)
