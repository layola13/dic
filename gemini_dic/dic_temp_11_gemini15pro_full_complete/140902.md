注意事项:  As the term “onanist” can be considered derogatory, it's generally advisable to use the more neutral and clinical term "masturbator" when discussing this topic.  The term "onanism" itself, while less offensive than "onanist," is also somewhat dated and clinical. "Masturbation" is generally preferred in modern usage.
