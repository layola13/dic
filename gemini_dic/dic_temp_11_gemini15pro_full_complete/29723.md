caticus: /kəˈtaɪkəs/ | adj. | 好战的，好争吵的 |  Likely derived from Latin "caticus," meaning "pertaining to a hunt" or "chase," though this is a reconstruction. It suggests a predisposition to pursue aggressively, hence "belligerent" or "quarrelsome." This word is not commonly used in modern English and might be considered archaic or even a neologism based on Latin roots. |  He displayed caticus behavior, constantly picking fights with his neighbors.  他表现出好战的行为，不断地与邻居吵架。| 近义词: belligerent, pugnacious, quarrelsome, contentious | 反义词: peaceful, amicable, conciliatory | 词性: adjective
