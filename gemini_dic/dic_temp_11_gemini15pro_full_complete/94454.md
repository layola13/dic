impolarily:/ɪmˈpoʊlərɪli/ | adv. | 非极性地，无极性地 | In a nonpolar manner; lacking polarity.  This refers to the distribution of electrical charge within a molecule. A nonpolar molecule has no positive or negative poles because the electrons are shared equally between the atoms. |  Electrons are distributed impolarily in the molecule. 电子在分子中非极性分布。|  nonpolarly, neutrally | polarly | adverb
