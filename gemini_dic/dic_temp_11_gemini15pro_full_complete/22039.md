词源:
From Middle English *bald, bold, from Old English beald (“bold, brave, strong, confident, powerful”), from Proto-Germanic *balþaz (“bold, brave, strong”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰel- (“to swell, blow”). Cognate with Scots bauld (“bold”), West Frisian bald (“soon, quickly”), Dutch bald (“soon”), German bald (“soon”). Related also to Old English belgan (“to swell with anger”), Old Norse belja (“to bellow”), Gothic 𐌱𐌰𐌻þｓ (balþs, “bold”).  The semantic shift from "strong" to "brave" and then to "impudent" is common to Germanic.  The meaning "clearly visible" arose from the use of thicker strokes in writing and printing to make something stand out.
