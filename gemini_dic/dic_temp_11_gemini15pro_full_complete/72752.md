ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *fogage, from foguer "to burn, set on fire," from Vulgar Latin *focāre, from Latin focus "hearth, fireplace".  The original meaning referred to the right to graze cattle on land after the crops had been harvested and the stubble burned. Over time, it came to mean the grazing itself, and specifically the winter grazing.
