##overvulcanizenaɪz/ | v. | 过度硫化；过度使用 (尤指橡胶) | 使橡胶或其他材料过度硫化，导致其变硬、变脆或性能下降。  |  The rubber was overvulcanized, making it brittle and unusable. (橡胶过度硫化，变得易碎且无法使用。)  The factory overvulcanized a batchof tires, resulting in customer complaints. (工厂过度硫化了一批轮胎，导致顾客投诉。) | vulcanize, cure (部分近义，取决于语境) | undercure (反义，指硫化不足) |动词the Roman god of fire, Vulcan.  Charles Goodyear accidentally discovered the process of vulcanization in 1839, a process that involves treating rubber with sulfur to improve durability and elasticity.  The process was named after Vulcan because of the heat involved in the process mirroring the god's fiery domain. Notably,while elemental sulfur is frequently used, other sulfur-containing compounds can be added for vulcanization.  This chemical reaction creates cross-links between the polymer chains in rubber, fundamentally changing its physical structure and properties.rubber or another material has gone too far. This results in undesirable properties  — primarily an excessive increase in hardness and a decrease in elasticity, leading to brittleness and potentially rendering the material useless for its intended purpose.  The term is often used in industrial contexts, particularly in the manufacturing of rubber products like tires,hoses, seals, and other elastomeric components.  The degree of vulcanization is a crucial parameter in the manufacturing process; an insufficient level produces weak material, whilst over-vulcanization causes the problems mentioned above.  The optimal degree of vulcanization is determined and controlled precisely during manufacturing to ensure the final product hasdesirable characteristics  such as pliability, tensile strength, and durability. Various methods are employed to monitor the vulcanization process, thus ensuring quality control.硫化。)the emphasis is solely on the excessive curing aspect. "Overtreat" or "overprocess" might be acceptable synonyms if discussing the vulcanization procedure within a broader range of industrial processes.vulcanization has occurred. "Underprocess" can also be considered if more emphasis is placed on the overall inadequateness of the treatment.
