词源:  This word is formed by adding multiple suffixes to "rudimentary."  "Rudimentary" comes from the Latin word "rudimentum," meaning "first beginning, first attempt, origin."  The suffix "-ary" forms an adjective.  "-arily" turns it into an adverb.  "-ness" turns the adverb into a noun.  Finally, the prefix "non-" negates the meaning.  Therefore, "nonrudimentarilynesses" represents the state or quality of not being rudimentary.
