Etymology:
From Middle French *embrasure* (unattested), derived from Old French *embraser* "to set on fire," itself from *en-* "in" + *braise* "burning coals," ultimately from Frankish **brasa**.  The sense shifted from "a window or opening from which to shoot" to include any similar recessed opening.
