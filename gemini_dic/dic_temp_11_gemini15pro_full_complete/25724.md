ETYMOLOGY->
From the name of Ned Buntline (pen name of Edward Zane Carroll Judson), a popular 19th-century American writer of dime novels featuring Western themes. He supposedly preferred a very heavy pistol, and the term "buntline special" came to be associated with long-barreled Colt revolvers, often with a shoulder stock attachment.  The term "buntline" then became associated with the thick rope used to secure such a holster.
