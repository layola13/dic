Etymology:
"non-" (prefix): from Latin "non" meaning "not"
"impartment": from "impart" (verb), from Old French "empartir" meaning "to share, divide," from Latin "impartire"  meaning "to share, divide," from "in-" (prefix) meaning "in, into" + "partire" meaning "to divide, share."  Therefore, "nonimpartment" literally means "not dividing."
