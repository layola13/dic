Etymology->
From Middle French *foister "insert a false card into a pack" (unattested), probably from Old French fust "wooden container, cask; shaft, staff" (from Frankish *fust "stick, club," from Proto-Germanic *fustuz "stick, club," from PIE *bʰuH- "to grow, swell"). The notion is of inserting something secretly.
