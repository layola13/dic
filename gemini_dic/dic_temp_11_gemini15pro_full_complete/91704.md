Etymology:  From hyper- "excessive" + consciousness.  "Hyper-" comes from the Greek "hyper" (ὑπέρ) meaning "over, above, beyond". "Consciousness" comes from Late Latin "conscientia" meaning "knowledge within oneself," from Latin "consciens" (present participle of "conscire" "to be conscious"), from "com-" "with, together" + "scire" "to know."
