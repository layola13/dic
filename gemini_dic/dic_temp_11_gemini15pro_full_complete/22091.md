The word "boln" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's a slang term, abbreviation, or a word from a specific dialect.  If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered the word, I can try to help further.

Since I cannot analyze "boln," I will use the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
