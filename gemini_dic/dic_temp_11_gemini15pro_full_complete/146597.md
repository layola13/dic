词源:  "Over-" (meaning "above" or "excessively") + "green".  While technically a valid word formation, "overgreen" is far less common than "evergreen" for describing plants that retain their green leaves year-round.  "Evergreen" has a Germanic origin, while "overgreen" likely arose as a later formation using the more common prefix "over-".
