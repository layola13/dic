注意事项:

"Jew's harp" is considered by some to be an offensive term.  While it's the most common name for this instrument, alternatives like "mouth harp," "jaw harp," or "trump" are preferred by some.  Using "Jew's harp" requires sensitivity and awareness of its potentially problematic nature.  Avoid using "jew's" as a possessive adjective in other contexts. It's archaic and can be perceived as offensive.  Use "Jewish" instead.
