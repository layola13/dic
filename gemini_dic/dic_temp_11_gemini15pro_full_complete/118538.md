mesolite:/ˈmɛzəˌlaɪt/| n.|中沸石，细柱沸石|A fibrous zeolite mineral, a hydrated calcium sodium aluminum silicate. It occurs in basalt cavities and is an intermediate member of the natrolite-scolecite series.|Example 1: Mesolite crystals were found lining the basalt vugs. 中沸石晶体被发现排列在玄武岩孔洞中。

Example 2: The specimen was identified as mesolite due to its needle-like habit and association with other zeolites.  该标本由于其针状习性和与其他沸石的伴生而被鉴定为中沸石。|近义词：natrolite, scolecite|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek μέσος (mesos, “middle”) + λίθος (lithos, “stone”), because its composition is intermediate between natrolite and scolecite.
