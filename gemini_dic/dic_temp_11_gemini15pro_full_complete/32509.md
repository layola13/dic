PHRASE-> (Not applicable for a technical term like chinone.  Phrases are more common with everyday words.)


词源：From German *Chinon*, from French *quinone*, from *quinine* (奎宁), due to its oxidation yielding quinone.


注意事项: "Chinone" is an older, less common spelling.  "Quinone" is the preferred and more widely accepted spelling.  It's crucial to use "quinone" in scientific and technical contexts.
