词源：cancel (from Old French canceller, from Latin cancellare "to make like a lattice," from cancelli "lattice") + out (Old English ūt, "outward, outside").  The idea is that crossing something out with lattice-like lines negates it, hence "cancel."  Then "out" emphasizes the complete removal or neutralization.
