##oxbow:/ˈɒksboʊ/ | n. |牛轭湖，河湾|-shaped bend in a river.  It's formed when a river cuts across a meander (a bend or curve in a river), isolating a section ofthe old river channel. This isolated section becomes a crescent-shaped lake, often filled with sediment over time. The term "oxbow" comes from its resemblanceto the shape of a yoke used for oxen. Oxbow lakes are common features in floodplains, where rivers have actively meandering channels.  The formation process involves erosion and deposition of sediments, with the faster flow of water eroding theoutside of the bend and depositing sediments on the inside. Over time, the meander neck narrows, and eventually, the river cuts through, leaving the oxbow lake behind.  These lakes are often rich in biodiversity due to calmer water and slowercurrents compared to the main river channel. They are also valuable aquatic habitats. Note many become shallower and eventually dry out completely over the years.闪闪发光，反射着周围泛滥平原上茂密的绿色植被。, crescent laketo an oxbow, a type of U-shaped yoke used to harness oxen.  The yoke's shape mirrors the curved shape of the isolated section of the river channel, hence the name.  The term's usage evolved from descriptive geography into common parlance.
