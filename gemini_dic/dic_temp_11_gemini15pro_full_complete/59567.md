From Late Latin *Ebionītae*, from Ancient Greek Ἐβιωναῖοι (*Ebionaîoi*), plural of Ἐβίων (*Ebiōn*), meaning "poor one," from Hebrew אֶבְיוֹן (*’ebyōn*), "poor." The name probably reflects their belief in voluntary poverty or their perception of themselves as the "poor" mentioned in the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3).
