Etymology:
over- (prefix) + obedient (adjective)
"over-" comes from Old English "ofer" meaning "above, beyond, excessively."
"obedient" comes from Old French "obedient" and ultimately from Latin "oboedientem" (present participle of "oboedire"), meaning "to obey," from "ob-" (towards) + "audire" (to hear).
