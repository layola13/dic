词源:  "Get-up-and-go" is an American idiom that likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century.  It's thought to be a playful, energetic-sounding phrase evoking the image of someone springing into action.  The reduplication of "get-up" emphasizes the sense of vigorous movement and enthusiasm.
