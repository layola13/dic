ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cataracta, from Latin cataracta (“waterfall, floodgate, portcullis”), from Ancient Greek κατάρρακτος (katárraktos, “down-rushing”), from καταράσσω (katarássō, “I dash down”).  The sense of "eye disease" arose from the notion of something obstructing vision, like a waterfall obstructing a view.
