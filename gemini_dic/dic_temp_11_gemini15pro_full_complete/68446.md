fame:/feɪm/ | n. | 名声，声誉 | The state of being known or talked about by many people, especially on account of notable achievements. |  Her fame spread throughout the country. 她的名声传遍了全国。 | renown, reputation, celebrity | obscurity, anonymity | noun

Etymology: From Middle English _fame_, from Old French _fame_ (Modern French _femme_ "woman"), from Latin _fāma_ ("rumor, report, reputation, fame"), from Proto-Italic *_fāmā_, from Proto-Indo-European *_bh₂-neh₁-méh₂_ ("speech, tale").  The semantic shift from "rumor" to "fame" is a common one across languages.
