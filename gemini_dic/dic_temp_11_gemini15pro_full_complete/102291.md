Since "itzibu" isn't a real word, I cannot provide accurate information about its meaning, usage, or any linguistic details.  The rest of the requested information (synonyms, antonyms, example sentences, tense usages, etc.) is therefore also impossible to provide.  If you meant a different word, please let me know.


If you're interested in word construction and neologisms, it's worth noting that "itzibu" doesn't follow common English phonetic or morphological patterns.  It's unlikely to be easily understood by English speakers without prior explanation.
