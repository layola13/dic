ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lymer*, from Old French *limier* "bloodhound", from *lime* "leash, cord", from Latin *limus* "slime, mud". The use of lime in hunting refers to the practice of marking the trail of the quarry with powdered lime.  最初来源于中世纪英语 *lymer*，来自古法语 *limier* “猎犬”，源于 *lime* “皮带，绳索”，最终来自拉丁语 *limus* “黏液，泥土”。狩猎中使用石灰是指用石灰粉标记猎物踪迹的做法。
