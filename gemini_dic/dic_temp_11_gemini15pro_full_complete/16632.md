ETYMOLOGY->
From French *baroque* "irregularly shaped pearl," from Portuguese *barroco*, from a Romance or Iberian word meaning "rough or imperfect pearl," perhaps related to Spanish *baruecco*. The term was initially used derisively to describe the extravagant and overly ornamented style of the 17th and early 18th centuries, but it later gained acceptance as a neutral term.
