decoherer:/ˌdiːkoʊˈhɪərər/| n. |粉末检波器，退相干器|A device used in early radio receivers to detect radio waves. It consisted of a glass tube containing metal filings that would clump together (cohere) when a radio wave passed through them, thus completing an electrical circuit.  A slight tap would then cause the filings to separate (decohere), ready to receive the next wave.|The decoherer was a crucial component in early wireless telegraphy systems.|Synonym: detector|Antonym: coherer|noun
