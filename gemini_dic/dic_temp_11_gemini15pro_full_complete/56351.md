词源:  From Middle English *doggewode*, from Old English *docga*, possibly related to *dag* (“dagger, point, prickle”) + *wudu* (“wood”).  The hard wood was used for making skewers, dags (daggers), and arrow shafts.  Later associated with "dog-tree" due to the use of the bark in treating mange in dogs.
