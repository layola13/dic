词源:  "Just in time" originated as a manufacturing term, particularly associated with the Toyota Production System (TPS) in Japan after World War II.  It reflects the philosophy of minimizing waste by receiving materials and producing goods only as needed.  The term has since broadened to encompass other areas like inventory management and logistics.
