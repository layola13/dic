ETYMOLOGY->
From camber + -ed.  "Camber" originates from the Old North French word "cambrer" meaning "to arch, to vault".  This further traces back to the Late Latin "cambire" meaning "to exchange, barter," and ultimately to the Greek "kamptein" meaning "to bend."  The shift in meaning from "bend" to "arch" likely occurred through the association of bending with the creation of arches.
