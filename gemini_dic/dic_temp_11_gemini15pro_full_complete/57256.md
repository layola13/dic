词源： "downloading" comes from the verb "download," which is a combination of "down" (indicating transfer from a larger system) and "load" (meaning to transfer data or programs into a computer).  The "-ing" suffix turns the verb into a present participle, used for continuous tenses and as a gerund (noun form).
