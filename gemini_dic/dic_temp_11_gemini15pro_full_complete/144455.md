PHRASE-> (This word is not commonly used in phrases.  It's a very specific and somewhat archaic term.  Therefore, providing phrases is difficult and potentially misleading.  Instead, I offer explanations of why typical phrase construction is difficult with this word.)

This verb doesn't easily lend itself to phrases in modern English.  Its specific meaning relating to the intensity of swearing makes it challenging to combine with other words to form common expressions.  Furthermore, its somewhat archaic nature further limits its usage in contemporary phrases.
