##paramorph 的详细解析ɔːrf/ | n. | 同形异构体 | 同晶异构体；同质异晶体 |  A paramorph is a mineral that has the same chemical composition as another mineral but a different crystal structure.This difference in structure often leads to variations in physical properties, such as hardness, cleavage, and optical properties. Paramors are formed through processes like phase transitionsor alterations under varying temperature or pressure conditions.| 例句：Quartz and cristobalite are paramorphs, both consisting of silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) but with different crystal structures.| 近义词：polymorph (多型体), allotrope (同素异形体)| 反义词：isomorph (同晶质体)**"beside" or "beyond," and "morph" (μορφή), meaning "form" or "shape."  Therefore, the term literally means "beside form" or "having a different form," accurately reflecting its definition as a mineral with the same chemical composition but a different crystal structure compared to another mineral. This distinguishes it from an *isomorph*, which has the same crystal structure but different chemical composition.their crystalline structure. This structural difference manifests in a variety of observable properties.  For example, two paramorphs might have different densities, hardness, cleavage patterns, optical behaviors (like birefringence), or even exhibit different colors or luster.  Understanding paramorphs is crucial for geologists and material scientists to fullycharacterize minerals and predict their behaviors under different conditions.  It's a key concept in phase transition studies, where materials change their crystalline form under the influence of factors such as temperature and pressure without altering their chemical formulas.a form of calcium carbonate) to calcite under certain geological conditions exemplifies the formation of a paramorph. Both are $CaCO_3$, but they have distinct crystal structures.  (文石在特定地质条件下转变为方解石是同形异构体形成的一个例子。两者都是$CaCO_3$，但它们具有不同的晶体结构。)压力和温度下矿物的稳定场和相变，从而为地球内部的地质模型提供信息。)structure.  Paramorph is a specific type of polymorph where the different crystal structures are related to each other, often through phase transition.  An *allotrope*, on the other hand, refers to different structural forms of the *same* element, such as diamond and graphite (both carbon).  Thus, thedistinction largely hinges on whether the different forms involve different chemical compositions (elements vs. compounds).  A paramorph would fall specifically under the overarching term "polymorph" but has the additional nuance of a close relationship between the different structural forms, suggesting a possible transformation between them.
