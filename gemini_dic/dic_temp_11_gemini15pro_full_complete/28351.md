cararta is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  It is possible that it is a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name), a technical term in a specific field, or a newly coined word.  If you could provide more context, I might be able to offer some suggestions.

If you meant "carta,"  here is the analysis:
