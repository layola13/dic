注意事项:
The provided examples assume "Lukar" is being used as a proper noun.  If intended as another part of speech (such as a newly coined verb or adjective), the usage and examples would need to be significantly altered to reflect that meaning.  It is also important to note that outside a specific context (e.g., a fictional world), "lukar" as an adjective is not standard English.
