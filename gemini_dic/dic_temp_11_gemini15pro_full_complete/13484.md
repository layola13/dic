atrypa:/əˈtraɪpə/ | n. | 無窗貝，阿特里帕腕足动物（一种已灭绝的腕足动物） | An extinct genus of brachiopods, especially common in Silurian and Devonian marine deposits, characterized by a spirifer-like shell with internal spiral supports for the lophophore.  These fossils are often found well-preserved and are important index fossils for these periods. | Example: The atypa fossils found in this rock formation suggest it dates back to the Devonian period. 在这块岩层中发现的无窗贝化石表明它可以追溯到泥盆纪时期。

Example: Atrypa brachiopods were abundant in shallow marine environments during the Paleozoic Era.  无窗贝腕足动物在古生代的浅海环境中数量丰富。 | Near synonyms: brachiopod, spirifer | Antonym: N/A (since it is a specific genus, it doesn't have a direct opposite) | noun
