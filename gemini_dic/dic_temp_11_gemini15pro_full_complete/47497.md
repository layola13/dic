Etymology:
From Old English *dēore "precious, valuable; glorious, noble," from Proto-Germanic *deurijaz (source also of Old Saxon diuri, Old Frisian diere, Old High German tiuri, German teuer "dear, expensive," Old Norse dýrr "valuable," Gothic diurs "dear, precious, costly"), from PIE *dew-ro-, from root *dew- "to fail, lack." The meaning "loved, precious" developed from "costly, highly valued."
