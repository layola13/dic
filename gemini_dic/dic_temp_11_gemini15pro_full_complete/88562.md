ETYMOLOGY->
From hitch + hike.  "Hitch" originally referred to a short, jerky pull or movement. "Hike" originally meant to walk vigorously or march, later evolving to mean a long walk or journey. The combination "hitchhike" emerged in the early 20th century, likely influenced by the idea of "catching a ride" by briefly pulling or jerking one's thumb to signal a passing driver.
