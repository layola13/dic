注意事项:  CCE is primarily used as an abbreviation and doesn't have a traditional etymology like a regular word.  It's derived from the initial letters of the job title.  It is also important to note that while "customer engineer" is a common term, "chief customer engineer" isn't as standardized and its specific duties might vary between companies.
