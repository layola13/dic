ETYMOLOGY->

From "over-" (excessive) + "normalization" (the process of making something normal).  "Normalization" comes from "normal" (conforming to a standard) + "-ization" (a suffix forming nouns from verbs and denoting an action or process).  The root of "normal" is Latin "normalis" (according to a carpenter's square, perpendicular).
