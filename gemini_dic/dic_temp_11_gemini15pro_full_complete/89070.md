holostei:/ˈhɒləstiːaɪ/ /ˈhoʊləstiːaɪ/
noun
硬鳞鱼类
A group of primitive ray-finned bony fishes, including gars and bowfins, characterized by ganoid scales and certain skeletal features.
The holostei are an ancient group of fish that have survived for millions of years. 硬鳞鱼类是一个古老的鱼类群体，已经生存了数百万年。
Holostei are considered to be a link between the more primitive chondrosteans and the more advanced teleosts. 硬鳞鱼类被认为是更原始的软骨硬鳞鱼和更高级的真骨鱼之间的联系。
近义词: ganoid fishes,
