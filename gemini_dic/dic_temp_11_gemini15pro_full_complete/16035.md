The word "bandal" does not appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

However, if you meant "bandal" as a variation of "bandaloop," which refers to a type of aerial dance or acrobatic performance, then a possible interpretation could be provided.  However, even "bandaloop" isn't a dictionary-defined word, but rather a proper noun referring to a specific performance company and their style.

Assuming you meant something close to "bandaloop" (aerial performance):

bandaloop: /ˈbændəˌluːp/ | n. | 空中表演 | A type of performance art involving aerial dance and acrobatics, often on the sides of buildings. | Example: The bandaloop performance was breathtaking, with dancers suspended high above the ground.  空中表演令人叹为观止，舞者悬挂在高空。 | Synonym: aerial dance, vertical dance | Antonym:  (No direct antonym) | noun
