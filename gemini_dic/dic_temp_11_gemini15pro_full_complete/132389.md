Etymologically, "nondemocratical" combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "democratical," which itself derives from "democracy."  "Democracy" originates from the Greek words "dēmos" (meaning "people") and "kratos" (meaning "power" or "rule"). Therefore, "nondemocratical" literally means "not of the people's rule."
