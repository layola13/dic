"maroy" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, a proper noun (like a name), or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more specific explanation.

However, I can still demonstrate the requested format with a common English word, "happen":

happen:/ˈhæpən/| v. |发生，出现，碰巧|Something unexpected happened. 发生了意想不到的事情。|The accident happened so quickly. 事故发生得太快了。|近义词：occur, take place|反义词: cease, stop|verb
