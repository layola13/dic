PHRASE->
studies of moners = 对原核生物的研究
diversity of moners = 原核生物的多样性
role of moners = 原核生物的作用
classification of moners = 原核生物的分类
evolution of moners = 原核生物的进化


注意事项:  "Monera" as a kingdom is now obsolete, having been replaced by the domains Bacteria and Archaea.  While "moners" can still be used informally to refer to prokaryotes, it's more accurate to use the terms "bacteria" and "archaea."
