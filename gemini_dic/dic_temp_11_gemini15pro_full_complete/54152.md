词性: 名词 (Noun)

词源:  This word appears to be a blend of "dis-" (prefix indicating negation or reversal) and "insanity." While "insanity" has a clear etymology (from Latin "insanitas"), "disensanity" is a relatively recent coinage and not yet recognized in standard dictionaries.  It likely emerged through informal usage to emphasize a heightened or particularly striking form of insanity.
