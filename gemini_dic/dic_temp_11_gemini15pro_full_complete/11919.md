注意事项:

*  "Arsed" is primarily used in British English and is considered informal and often vulgar.  Avoid using it in formal settings.  There are many less offensive ways to express a lack of interest or enthusiasm.  While it can technically be used in various tenses, its usage is mostly confined to simple present and past tenses in common speech.  The future tense examples provided are grammatically correct but rarely used in practice, and sound unnatural.  It's best to avoid using "arsed" altogether in formal situations or when speaking to people you don't know well.
