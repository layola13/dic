注意事项:

"itza" itself isn't a standard English word.  It's a phonetic spelling of a casual pronunciation of "it's a".  Therefore, it doesn't have a formal etymology in the same way a dictionary word does.  It arises from natural speech patterns where sounds are elided or shortened.  The contraction "it's" itself comes from the Old English "hit is".  The "a" is the indefinite article.
