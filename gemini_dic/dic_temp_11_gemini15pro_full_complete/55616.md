词源：  "Disvulnerability" is a relatively recent term, likely formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to "vulnerability".  While "vulnerability" has Latin roots (from "vulnerabilis," meaning "wounded"), "disvulnerability" is a modern formation.  It's less common than "invulnerability," which conveys a similar but stronger sense of being completely immune to harm.
