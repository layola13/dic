##oxygenicity: 详细解析nɪsəti/ | /ˌɑːksɪdʒɪˈnɪsəti/ | n. | 氧气含量；含氧量 |  Oxygenicity refers to the amount of oxygen present in a substance orenvironment.  It is often used in scientific contexts, particularly in fields like chemistry, biology, and environmental science. High oxygenicity indicates a high concentration of oxygen, while low oxygenicity signifies a low concentration.  |  The high oxygenicity of the mountain air was invigorating.  这座山的空气含氧量很高，令人精神振奋。 The low oxygenicity at high altitudes can causealtitude sickness. 高海拔地区的低含氧量会导致高原反应。 |  oxygen content, oxygen level | anoxia, hypoxia | 名词and the suffix "-icity," which is used to form nouns indicating a quality or state.  "Oxygen" itself comes from the Greek words "oxys" (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "sour," and "genes" (γεννάω), meaning "to generate" or "toproduce."  This is because early scientists associated oxygen with the acidity of substances. The suffix "-icity" derives from the Latin suffix "-icitas," which indicates "quality" or "state." Therefore, oxygenicity literally describes the "quality or state of having oxygen".used in scientific and technical writing.  It's not a word you'd typically encounter in everyday conversation.  Its use emphasizes the quantitative aspect of oxygen presence, focusing on the *amount* rather than simply the *presence* of oxygen. For example,  comparing two environments, one might say one has ahigher oxygenicity than the other. It is often measured and expressed as a concentration (e.g., parts per million, percent).。
