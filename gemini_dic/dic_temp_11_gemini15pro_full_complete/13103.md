astrophotometry:/ˌæstroʊfoʊˈtɒmətri/| n.|天体测光学|The branch of astronomy concerned with measuring the brightness and other properties of celestial objects.  It involves the precise measurement of the intensity of light from celestial objects, such as stars, galaxies, and nebulae.  These measurements can provide valuable information about the physical properties of these objects, such as their temperature, size, and composition.|Astronomers used astrophotometry to determine the brightness of the supernova.|近义词:photometry|反义词:None|词性:noun

Etymology:
astro- (from Greek astron, meaning "star") + photo- (from Greek phōs, meaning "light") + -metry (from Greek metron, meaning "measure")
