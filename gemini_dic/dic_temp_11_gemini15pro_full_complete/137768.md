PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It is primarily used adverbially to describe a biological process.)
This word doesn't typically form common phrases.  It's mainly used to describe how something occurs in a biological context, emphasizing the absence of vascular tissue involvement.


Because of the technical nature of "nonvascularly," it's less common to see it in everyday phrases. It's most often used scientifically to describe processes in plants like mosses or liverworts that lack vascular systems.
