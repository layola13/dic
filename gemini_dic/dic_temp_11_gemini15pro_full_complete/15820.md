词源:
This term originated in the early 20th century and likely alludes to the physical pain of having one's testicles crushed. This literal meaning then evolved metaphorically to describe situations that are extremely difficult and demanding, causing a similar level of emotional or mental distress.  Over time, the term also took on the connotation of domineering or bullying behavior, perhaps because of the association with aggressive masculinity.
