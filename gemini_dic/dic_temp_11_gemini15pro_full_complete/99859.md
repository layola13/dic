ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *intermotio, from Latin intermere ("to bury"), from in- ("in") + terra ("earth").  The less common sense of "interruption" likely arises from the idea of something being "put in the earth" or "buried" figuratively, thus interrupted.

PHRASE-> (Given the rarity of the word "intermotion" outside the context of burial, common phrases are limited.)

the intermotion of the deceased = 死者的埋葬
arrange for the intermotion = 安排埋葬
the site of intermotion = 埋葬地点
a ceremony of intermotion = 埋葬仪式
following the intermotion = 葬礼之后

注意事项:  Intermotion is a less common synonym for burial.  Its secondary meaning of "interruption" is even rarer.  Use "burial" or "interment" for standard usage related to funerals and "interruption," "pause," or "cessation" for the less common meaning.
