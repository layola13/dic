PHRASE->
(While less common than using "aheap" by itself, here are some potential phrases, though they may sound slightly archaic or poetic):
lie aheap =  躺着成堆
gather aheap =  聚集一堆
pile aheap = 堆积成堆
left aheap = 被留下成堆
scattered aheap =  散落成堆 (This is somewhat paradoxical, as "scattered" implies spreading out, while "aheap" implies piling up. However, it could be used to describe a loose, disordered pile.)
