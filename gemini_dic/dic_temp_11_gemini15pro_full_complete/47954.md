词源：From French *decidement*, from décider (“to decide”) + -ment (“-ment”).


* **Note:** While "decidement" exists, "decision" is the standard and far more commonly used word in modern English for the act of deciding or a conclusion reached.  "Decidement" is considered archaic or obsolete by many dictionaries.  Using "decision" is generally recommended.
