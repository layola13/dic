ETYMOLOGY->

From exacting + -ness + -'s.
Exacting: from late Middle English: present participle of exact, from Old French exacter or Latin exactare ‘drive out, enforce payment of (a debt or tax)’, from ex- ‘out’ + agere ‘drive’.  The sense ‘demand rigorously’ dates from the mid 17th century.
-ness: Old English -nes(s), -nis(s), of Germanic origin; related to Dutch -nis and German -nis, -heit.  Used to form nouns from adjectives or participles, denoting quality, state, or condition (as in kindness, highness, happiness).
-'s: possessive marker.
