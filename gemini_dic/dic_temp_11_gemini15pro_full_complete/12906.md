词源:
From the Old French "assurer" (to make sure, guarantee), which in turn comes from the Latin "ad" (to) and "securare" (to make safe).  The ending "-ed" forms the past participle, which can function as an adjective. The apostrophe-s ('s) indicates the possessive form, either singular or plural.  In the context of insurance, "assured's" specifically refers to the possessions or rights of the person insured.
