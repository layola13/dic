meltingnesses:/ˈmɛltɪŋnəsɪz/
n.
熔化; 融化状态 (复数形式，罕用)
The state or quality of being melted or molten; multiple instances of melting.  This word is extremely rare and generally considered non-standard. It's grammatically correct, but you'd almost never encounter it in real-world usage.
I can't provide a natural-sounding example sentence using "meltingnesses" because it's not a word commonly used.  Using "melting" or "molten states" would be preferable.
近义词: fluidity, liquefaction, moltenness (more common)
反义词: solidity, freezing, congealment
词性: noun
