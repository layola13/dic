ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *muscelle*, from Old English *muscelle*, *muscle*, from West Germanic *muskulā*, from Latin *musculus* (“small sea mussel, sea mouse, muscle”), diminutive of *mūs* (“mouse”). The bivalve's shell resembles a mouse.  The anatomical sense ("muscle") developed later from a fancied resemblance of contracted muscles to a mussel's shape.
