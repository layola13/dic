词源:  "Nonsalutariness" comes from "salutary," which is derived from the Latin "salūtāris," meaning "healthful." The prefix "non-" negates the meaning, resulting in "not healthful." The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being not salutary. The plural form is "nonsalutarinesses."
