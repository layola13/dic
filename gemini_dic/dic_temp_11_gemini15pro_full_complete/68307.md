词源:  From Middle English *faldage, from Old French *falde, from Late Latin *falda (“fold, layer”), from Latin fallere ("to deceive, trip, cause to fall").  The meaning shifted from "a fold" to "folded hay" and then to fodder generally. Note that this etymology is reconstructed, as the Old French and Middle English forms are not attested. The word is likely related to "fold" (as in sheepfold) and shares a root with words like "false" and "fault."
