orientable:/ˌɔːriˈentəbl/ | adj. | 可定向的 | Able to be assigned a consistent orientation.  In mathematics, particularly in topology and geometry, it refers to surfaces or manifolds that have two distinct "sides". |  A sphere is an orientable surface. 一个球体是可定向的表面。

The Möbius strip is a non-orientable surface. 莫比乌斯环是一个不可定向的表面。 | 近义词: two-sided | 反义词: non-orientable, unorientable | 词性: adjective

Etymology: From orient + -able.  "Orient" ultimately comes from the Latin "oriens" meaning "rising" (as in the rising sun), which gives rise to the idea of "east" and, by extension, determining direction.
