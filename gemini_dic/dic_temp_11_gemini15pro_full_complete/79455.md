ETYMOLOGY->
From glitz (n.) + -es (verb inflection for third person singular present tense),  glitz itself likely originated as a back-formation from glitzy (adjective), which appeared in the mid-20th century, probably influenced by words like ritzy.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but may be imitative of the flashing of light.
