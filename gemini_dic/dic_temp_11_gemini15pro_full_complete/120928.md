PHRASE->
(Due to the sensitive nature of the word "miscegenated" and its historical association with racist ideology, it's not commonly used in phrases.  Using the more neutral and accurate term "mixed-race" is generally preferred.)  由于“miscegenated”一词的敏感性及其与种族主义意识形态的历史联系，它在短语中并不常用。一般来说，使用更中性和准确的术语“mixed-race”更合适。
