From the past participle of *choose*, from Old English *cēosan* "to choose, seek out, select, test," from Proto-Germanic *keusan* (source also of Old Saxon *kiosan*, Old Frisian *kiasa*, Dutch *kiezen*, Old High German *kiosan*, German *kiesen*, Old Norse *kjósa*), from PIE root *ǵeus- "to taste, choose." The ending *-ens* represents the plural inflection of past participles used as nouns.
