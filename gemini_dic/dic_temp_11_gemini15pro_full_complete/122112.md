Etymology (Hypothetical):  Potentially a blend of "mist" and "musk." "Mist" from Old English *mist "dark, thick cloud; gloom, darkness." "Musk" from Middle French musc, from Late Latin muscus, from Greek moskhos, from Persian mushk, probably ultimately from Sanskrit muská-s "testicle" (so called because of the appearance of the gland).
