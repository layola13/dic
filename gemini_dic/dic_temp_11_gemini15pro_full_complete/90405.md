注意事项:

"Hows" is very informal and best used in spoken English or casual written communication.  It is generally not appropriate for formal writing.  While some examples are given for past/future tenses, it's worth noting that using "hows" in these contexts is grammatically incorrect, though accepted in casual speech. It's better to use the full forms ("How is," "How was," "How will," etc.) in formal settings or when grammatical accuracy is important.
