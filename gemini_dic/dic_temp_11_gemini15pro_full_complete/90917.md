词源: The word "hurcan" comes from the Spanish word "huracán," which ultimately derives from the name of a Taino (Caribbean indigenous people) god of wind and storms, Hurakan.  "Hurcan" is primarily used in Spanish-speaking contexts, particularly in the Caribbean.  While "hurricane" is the more common term in English, "hurcan" is sometimes used, especially in areas with a strong Spanish influence.
