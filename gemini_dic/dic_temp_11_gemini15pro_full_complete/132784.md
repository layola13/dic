nonductilities: /ˌnɒndʌkˈtɪlɪtiz/
n.
lack of ductility; brittleness
The nonductility of the material made it unsuitable for bending.  这种材料的非延展性使其不适合弯曲。
Synonym: inflexibility, rigidity, stiffness
Antonym: ductility, malleability, flexibility
noun

Etymology:
From non- (not) + ductility (the ability of a solid material to deform under tensile stress)  来自non-（不）+ ductility（固体材料在拉伸应力下变形的能力）
