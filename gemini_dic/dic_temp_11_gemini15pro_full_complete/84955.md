hapless:/ˈhæpləs/| adj.|不幸的，倒霉的|Unlucky and unfortunate; prone to misfortune.|The hapless traveler lost his passport and all his money.  这个不幸的旅行者丢失了护照和所有的钱。|近义词：unlucky, unfortunate, ill-fated, cursed|反义词:lucky, fortunate, blessed|词性:形容词
词源:From hap (n.) "chance, fortune," from Old Norse happ "chance, good luck," + -less. Originally meant "unlucky;" sense of "powerless, helpless" is from c. 1600, probably by accidental confusion with helpless.  源自hap（名词）“机会，运气”，来自古诺尔斯语happ“机会，好运”，加上-less。最初意思是“不幸的”；“无能为力，无助”的意思来自公元1600年左右，可能是由于与helpless的偶然混淆。
