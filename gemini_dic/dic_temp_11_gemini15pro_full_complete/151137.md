##paratectonic: 详细解析tɒnɪk/ | adj. | 副构造的；伴生的| Relating to or denoting the structures or processes that are associated with, but not directly caused by, plate tectonics.  | Paratectonic processes,such as erosion and sedimentation, can significantly modify the landscape shaped by plate tectonics. 副构造过程，例如侵蚀和沉积，可以显著改变板块构造塑造的地貌。 |  (近义词缺乏直接对应词，可根据语境选择相关词汇，例如：related, associated, accompanying) | (反义词缺乏直接对应词，可根据语境选择相关词汇，例如：primary, principal, direct)," "near," "alongside," or "secondary."  It indicates a relationship of proximity or secondary importance.processes that shape the Earth's crust, primarily through plate tectonics.geophysics to describe geological processes and structures that are related to plate tectonics but are not its direct consequences. These processes often act in conjunction with plate tectonics, modifying or shaping the results of tectonic activity.  The term emphasizes the secondary but significant role of these processes.  For example:Sedimentation:**  While plate tectonics uplift mountain ranges, erosion and sedimentation reshape them, creating valleys, plains, and depositing sediment in basins.  These are paratectonic processes.can be considered a paratectonic effect.  The folding is a secondary consequence of the fault's movement.paratectonic event if the timing or location isn't directly driven by major plate boundary events.  (This would depend on the detailed geological context.). 研究人员研究了与断裂系统相关的副构造变形，重点是次生褶皱和裂缝。主要是河谷和平原，受到了作用于构造抬升地形的副构造过程的显著影响。onyms  for "paratectonic" is challenging because it's a highly technical term.  The best choice depends on the specific context and the aspect of "paratectonic" being emphasized (secondary, accompanying, etc.).
