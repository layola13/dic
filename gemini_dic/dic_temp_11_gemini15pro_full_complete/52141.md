Etymology: From Old French *diaper, alteration of diaspre "figured cloth," from Medieval Latin diasprus, from diaspros "transparent," from Greek dia "through" + spora "seed, a sowing." Originally referred to a type of small, repeating geometric pattern on cloth, which was later applied to a type of linen cloth, and eventually to the absorbent cloths used as diapers.
