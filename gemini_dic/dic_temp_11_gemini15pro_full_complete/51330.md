detectabilities:/dɪˌtɛktəˈbɪlɪtiz/| n. |可探测性，可检测性|The plural form of detectability, referring to the qualities or states of being detectable or capable of being discovered or identified.|The study focused on the detectabilities of various viruses in different biological samples.|近义词：discoverabilities, perceptibilities, observabilities|反义词：invisibility, imperceptibility, undetectability|词性:名词

词源:  From detectable + -ity.  "Detectable" comes from the verb "detect," which has its roots in the Latin word "detectus," the past participle of "detegere," meaning "to uncover, disclose, or discover." The suffix "-ity" is used to form nouns indicating a state or quality.
