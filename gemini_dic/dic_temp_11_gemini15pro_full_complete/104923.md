词源:

The term "kek" originated from the Korean word "kekeke," which is an onomatopoeia for laughter, similar to "hahaha" in English. In the online game World of Warcraft, when a player of the opposing faction (Horde) typed "lol," players of the Alliance faction saw it rendered as "kek" due to the game's language filtering system.  This cross-faction miscommunication led to the adoption of "kek" within the gaming community and its eventual spread to broader internet culture.
