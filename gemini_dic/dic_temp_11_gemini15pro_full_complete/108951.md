Cognate with Old Frisian lēra (“to teach”), Old Saxon lērian (“to teach, learn”), Old High German lēran (“to teach, learn”), Gothic 𐌻𐌰𐌹𐍃𐌾𐌰𐌽 (laisjan, “to teach”), Old Norse læra (“to teach, learn”), Danish lære (“to teach, learn”), Swedish lära (“to teach, learn”), Icelandic læra (“to learn”). Related also to Old English lār (“lore, learning, doctrine”). More at lore.  The sense shifted to "look askance, leer" around 1500.
