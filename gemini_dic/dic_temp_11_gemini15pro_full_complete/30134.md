注意事项：

"ceed" itself is rarely used as a standalone verb. It is primarily used in combination with prefixes to form other words, such as "proceed," "succeed," "exceed," and "recede."  Therefore, the examples provided utilize "ceed" in a way that demonstrates its core meaning, but in practice, these sentences would likely be phrased using one of the more common derived words.  For example, "The project is proceeding well" is more natural than "The project is ceeding well."
