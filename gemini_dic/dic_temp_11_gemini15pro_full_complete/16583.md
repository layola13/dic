词源:  "Barnstorm" originated in the early 20th century, referring to itinerant actors who performed in barns or any available space, often in rural areas. Later, the term was applied to stunt pilots who performed at county fairs and offered rides, sometimes landing and taking off from barns.  Eventually, the meaning broadened to include any kind of whirlwind tour, particularly in politics.
