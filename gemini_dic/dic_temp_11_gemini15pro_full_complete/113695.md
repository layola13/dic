macled:/ˈmækəld/ | adj. | 成双晶的；孪晶的；格子状的 | Twinned; composed of intersecting twin crystals, often forming a cross or grid pattern. | The macled mineral displayed a beautiful cross-shaped pattern.  这种孪晶矿物呈现出美丽的十字形图案。 | Example: The geologist discovered a macled specimen of staurolite. 地质学家发现了一个十字石的孪晶标本。 | Synonym: twinned, crossed | Antonym: single, untwinned | Adjective


macled:/ˈmækəld/ | n. | 孪晶 | A twinned crystal. | The macled structure was clearly visible under the microscope.  在显微镜下，孪晶结构清晰可见。 | Example: He studied the macled formation in the rock sample. 他研究了岩石样本中的孪晶结构。 | Synonym: twin | Antonym: single crystal | Noun


Etymology:
From French *maclé*, from Old French *mascle* “mesh of a net,” from Latin *macula* “spot, mesh.”  The term refers to the resemblance of twinned crystals to the intersecting lines of a net or lattice.
