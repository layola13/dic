ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *decantatus, past participle of decantare (“to sing or chant a magic formula, to pour off”), from Latin de- (“down, away”) + cantare (“to sing, chant”).  The original meaning was related to using incantations while pouring liquids, later evolving to simply mean pouring carefully.
