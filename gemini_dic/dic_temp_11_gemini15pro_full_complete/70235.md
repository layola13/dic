Etymology: From Middle English *fikelliche*, from Old English *ficollice*, from *ficol* (“deceitful, treacherous”) + *-lice* (adverbial suffix).  The root *ficol* is related to Old Frisian *fikel*, Middle Dutch *vekel*, and Old High German *vihhila*.  Ultimately from Proto-Germanic *fīkulaz* (“changeable, unreliable”), perhaps from Proto-Indo-European *peyg-* (“to deceive”).
