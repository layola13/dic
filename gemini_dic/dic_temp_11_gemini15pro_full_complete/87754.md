词源: "Heyy" is a variant of "hey," which itself is likely a shortening of "heyday." While "heyday" refers to a period of success or prosperity, "hey" has evolved into a simple interjection used as a greeting or to attract attention. The extra "y" in "heyy" is a relatively recent development, primarily used in informal online communication and text messaging to add emphasis or a playful tone.
