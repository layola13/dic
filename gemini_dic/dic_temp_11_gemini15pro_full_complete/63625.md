注意事项:
"eo" is not a common word in modern English.  It's archaic or dialectal and rarely used.  While all the grammatical examples are technically correct, they would sound unnatural in most contexts.  A native speaker would almost always use a different interjection.  It's important to be aware of this limited usage.
