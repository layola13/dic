collisionless:/kəˈlɪʒənˌləs/| adj.|无碰撞的|Characterized by a lack of collisions between particles.  This term is often used in physics, particularly in plasma physics and astrophysics, to describe systems where the density is so low that interactions between particles are negligible.|例句：The solar wind is often modeled as a collisionless plasma.  太阳风通常被模拟为无碰撞等离子体。

例句：Collisionless shocks are a common feature in space plasmas.  无碰撞激波是空间等离子体中的常见特征。|近义词：non-colliding, interaction-free|反义词：collisional, interacting|词性:adjective
