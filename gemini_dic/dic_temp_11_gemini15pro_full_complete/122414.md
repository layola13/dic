mnn:/ˌɛmˌɛnˈɛn/ | abbreviation |abbr.| 米利微纳米 | Millimicron nanometer, a unit of length equal to one billionth of a meter.  This term is outdated and now preferably replaced by nanometer (nm). | The wavelength of this laser is in the mnn range.  这个激光的波长在米利微纳米范围内。 | 近义词: nanometer (nm)| 反义词:  (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement) |  n. (as a unit of measurement)



USAGE->

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The term "nanometer" has largely replaced "mnn." “纳米”一词已在很大程度上取代了“米利微纳米”。
Scientists have adopted the nanometer as the standard unit. 科学家们已经采用纳米作为标准单位。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Scientists have been using nanometers for several decades now. 几十年来，科学家们一直在使用纳米。
They have been gradually phasing out the use of mnn.  他们一直在逐步淘汰米利微纳米的应用。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Scientists used the term "mnn" in the past.  过去，科学家们使用“米利微纳米”一词。
The mnn was a common unit of measurement in the mid-20th century.  米利微纳米是20世纪中期常用的测量单位。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Researchers were using mnn before the widespread adoption of the nanometer. 在广泛采用纳米之前，研究人员正在使用米利微纳米。
They were transitioning to the nanometer during that period.  在那段时期，他们正在过渡到纳米。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
By the end of the 20th century, the nanometer had replaced the mnn. 到20世纪末，纳米已经取代了米利微纳米。
Scientists had already started using the nanometer before the term "mnn" became obsolete. 在“米利微纳米”一词过时之前，科学家们就已经开始使用纳米了。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Scientists had been using the mnn for some time before it was replaced. 在被取代之前，科学家们已经使用米利微纳米一段时间了。
They had been gradually moving towards the nanometer as the preferred unit.  他们一直逐渐转向纳米作为首选单位。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The term "mnn" will likely disappear completely from scientific literature. “米利微纳米”一词可能会从科学文献中完全消失。
Future generations of scientists will probably not even recognize the term.  未来的几代科学家可能根本不认识这个词。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Scientists will be using nanometers exclusively in the future. 科学家们将来将只使用纳米。
They will be continuing to refine measurement techniques at the nanoscale.  他们将继续改进纳米级的测量技术。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By 2050, the term "mnn" will have become completely obsolete. 到2050年，“米利微纳米”一词将完全过时。
Scientists will have fully transitioned to the nanometer by then.  到那时，科学家们将完全过渡到纳米。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the end of the century, scientists will have been using nanometers for over a hundred years. 到本世纪末，科学家们将已经使用纳米超过一百年了。
They will have been exploring the nanoscale world with increasing precision. 他们将以越来越高的精度探索纳米世界。


PHRASE->
(Since mnn is a rarely used technical term, common phrases are unlikely.  Here are some examples of how it might be used in a phrase.)

measuring in mnn  以米利微纳米为单位测量
converting mnn to nm  将米利微纳米转换为纳米
expressed in mnn 以米利微纳米表示
the obsolete unit mnn  过时的单位米利微纳米
