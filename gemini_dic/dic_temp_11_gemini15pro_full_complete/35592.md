ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *cors*, from Old French *cors*, *gros* “big, thick, fat,” from Late Latin *corpulentus* “having a large body,” from Latin *corpus* “body.”  The semantic shift from "large, thick" to "rough, coarse" likely occurred through association with textures of larger, thicker materials.
