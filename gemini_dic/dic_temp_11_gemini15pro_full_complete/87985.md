词源:
From "high" + "octane".  "Octane" refers to a hydrocarbon found in petrol.  Higher octane ratings indicate greater resistance to knocking (premature detonation) in the engine, resulting in smoother and more powerful performance. This technical term was then extended metaphorically to describe anything powerful, energetic, or exciting.
