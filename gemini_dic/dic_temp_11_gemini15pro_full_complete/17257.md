bayest: This word is not a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's a specialized term or a neologism.  If you meant something similar, like "bayest" as a past tense conjugation of a verb "baye," more context is needed.  Since it's not a standard word, the requested format cannot be filled accurately.  However, I can offer some speculation assuming it was intended to be a real word:
