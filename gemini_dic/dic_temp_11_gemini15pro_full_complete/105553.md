"kimnel" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a dialectal word, a proper noun, or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, I can still provide the requested grammatical explanations and examples using the word "what" since the prompt focuses heavily on its usage:
