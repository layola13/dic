chronoscope:/ˈkrɒnəskəʊp/ (UK) /ˈkrɑːnəskoʊp/ (US)| n.|计时器；精密计时器|An instrument for measuring very short intervals of time, often down to milliseconds or even smaller units.  It is used in scientific experiments, especially in psychology and physiology, to accurately measure reaction times and other short durations.|The psychologist used a chronoscope to measure the subject's reaction time to the stimulus.|近义词:timer, stopwatch, chronograph|反义词:N/A|noun
