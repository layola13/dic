PHRASE->

(While using "deafness's" in phrases is uncommon and generally awkward, a more natural way to express possession is with prepositional phrases like "of deafness.")

the impact of deafness = 失聪的影响
the causes of deafness = 失聪的起因
the challenges of deafness = 失聪的挑战
the treatment of deafness = 失聪的治疗
the genetic basis of deafness = 失聪的遗传基础


注意事项:

The word "deafness's" can be grammatically correct, but it's often awkward and less common than using "of deafness."  It's usually preferable to rephrase using "of deafness" for smoother, more natural-sounding English.
