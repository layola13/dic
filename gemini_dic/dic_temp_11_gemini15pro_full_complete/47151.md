davyum:/ˈdeɪviəm/| n.|钅达|A hypothetical transuranic chemical element (atomic number 105). Named after Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist.  It was later officially named dubnium.|Scientists theorized about the existence of davyum, element 105. 科学家们对105号元素钅达的存在进行了理论推测。|Synonyms:  dubnium (official name), element 105 (by atomic number), unnilpentium (temporary IUPAC name)|Antonyms: None (as it is a specific element)|Noun
Etymology:  Named after Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829), an English chemist. Originally claimed to have been discovered by Russian chemist Serge Kern in 1877, it was later proven to be a mixture of other elements. Element 105 was definitively synthesized in 1970 and officially named dubnium.
