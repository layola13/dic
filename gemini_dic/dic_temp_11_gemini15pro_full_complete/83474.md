词源:  Derived from "hack," which comes from the Middle English "hakene," meaning "to cut irregularly." The sense of a "hack writer" developed in the 18th century, referring to someone who wrote dull, unoriginal pieces for money.  The older meanings related to horses and carriages likely derive from a different, though perhaps related, sense of "hack" meaning "to hire out."
