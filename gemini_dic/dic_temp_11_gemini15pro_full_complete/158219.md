The exact classification and relationship between various broad-winged insects is still a subject of ongoing taxonomic refinement.usage generally involves the scientific description and categorization of insects, discussing their evolutionary relationships, or comparisons between different insect Orders.is becoming less common in modern literature, with its component families now frequently categorized within other orders, like Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Trichoptera (caddisflies).  It serves more historically as a grouping than a definitive current classification system used by all entomologists.✩广翅目(Platyptera)分类体系的变动，反映了昆虫进化研究中哪些更深层次的理论冲突或范式转变？特征（宽翅），能否从基因组学或其他角度重新界定并研究“广翅目”昆虫的内在联系？
