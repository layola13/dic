词源:  en- (prefix meaning "to make," "to put into") + rive (obsolete verb meaning "to split or tear apart," figuratively used to mean "to absorb or engross").  The word "enrive" is considered archaic or obsolete in modern English and rarely used.  It's likely a back-formation from the word "enriven," the past participle of "enrive."
