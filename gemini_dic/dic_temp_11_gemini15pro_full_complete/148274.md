oversmoothness:/ˌoʊvərˈsmuːðnəs/| n. |过度平滑，过度光滑|The state of being excessively smooth, often to the point of losing important details or variations.  This term is commonly used in statistics, signal processing, and image processing.  It refers to a situation where a smoothing technique, like averaging or filtering, has been applied too aggressively, resulting in a loss of information or distortion.|The oversmoothness of the image made it difficult to distinguish individual features. 图像过度平滑，难以区分单个特征。

The oversmoothness of the statistical model led to inaccurate predictions. 统计模型的过度平滑导致了不准确的预测。|近义词：overfitting, blurring|反义词: roughness, detail, sharpness|词性: noun
