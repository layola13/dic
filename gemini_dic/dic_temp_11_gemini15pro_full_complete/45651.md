PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Curstfully" is not typically used in set phrases.  It's an adverb describing the manner of an action, rather than forming part of a fixed expression.


词源:  From "cursed" + "-fully." "Cursed" derives from the Old English "cursian," meaning "to curse."


注意事项:
"Curstfully" is an archaic and relatively uncommon word. While grammatically correct, it is rarely used in modern English.  Consider using a more contemporary synonym like "maliciously" or "spitefully."
