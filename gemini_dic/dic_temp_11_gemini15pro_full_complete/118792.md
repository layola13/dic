metalogical:/ˌmɛtəˈlɒdʒɪkəl/ | adj. | 元逻辑的 | Relating to the study of the formal properties of logical systems, such as consistency, completeness, and soundness, rather than the content or truth of particular statements within those systems. | Metalogical investigations examine the frameworks within which logical reasoning takes place. 元逻辑研究考察逻辑推理发生的框架。|  Metalogical theorems, unlike logical theorems, are not about the validity of arguments, but about the properties of logical systems themselves.  与逻辑定理不同，元逻辑定理不是关于论证的有效性，而是关于逻辑系统本身的属性。|  The question of whether a logical system is complete is a metalogical one.  逻辑系统是否完整的问题是一个元逻辑问题。| synonyms: meta-logical | antonyms: (No direct antonym, but perhaps "object-level" in some contexts) | word type: adjective
