词源:

"Blive" is an archaic or dialectal form of the verb "believe," primarily found in Scottish and Northern English dialects. It shares the same Proto-Germanic root as "believe," which is *ga-laubjaną, meaning "to hold dear" or "to cherish."  Over time, this evolved into the Old English "belēfan" and eventually the modern English "believe."  The form "blive" represents a variant pronunciation and spelling that persisted in certain regional dialects.
