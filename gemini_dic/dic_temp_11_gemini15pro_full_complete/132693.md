PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases. It's highly technical and usually appears in scientific contexts.  Therefore, creating natural phrases is difficult and might sound forced. Providing examples within full sentences offers a more realistic demonstration of its usage.)

This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  Its usage is primarily limited to specific scientific and technical contexts describing energy transfer or system behavior.  Therefore, instead of isolated phrases, here are examples within sentences that demonstrate its application:

1.  The system is designed to operate **nondissipatedly**, minimizing energy loss.

2.  Ideally, energy should flow **nondissipatedly** through the circuit.

3.  The researchers achieved **nondissipatedly** energy transfer in their experiment.

4.  The theoretical model assumes **nondissipatedly** propagation of waves.

5.  They are exploring ways to achieve **nondissipatedly** data transmission.


词源:  "Nondissipatedly" is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to "dissipatedly," which itself comes from the verb "dissipate" (to scatter, disperse, or waste) and the adverbial suffix "-ly."  The root of "dissipate" traces back to Latin "dissipare," meaning "to scatter in different directions."
