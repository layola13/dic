ETYMOLOGY->
From affectionate + -ness.  Affectionate comes from the Late Latin *affectionatus*, past participle of *affectionare* "to have affection for," from Latin *affectio* "state of mind, feeling, affection," from *afficere* "to influence, act on,"  from *ad-* "to" + *facere* "to do, make."  The suffix *-ness* forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
