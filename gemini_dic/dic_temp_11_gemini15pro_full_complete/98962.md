Etymology:
"Inter-" (prefix): Latin, meaning "between," "among," "mutually," "reciprocally."
"In-" (prefix): Latin, meaning "not," "opposite of," "without."
"Dependence": from Late Latin "dependentia," from Latin "dependens," present participle of "dependere" meaning "to hang down," "to be dependent on."  The prefix “inter-” indicates a reciprocal or mutual relationship between entities. Thus, “inter-independences” refers to a state where multiple entities are mutually dependent on each other.
