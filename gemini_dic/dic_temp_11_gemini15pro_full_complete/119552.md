microsporic:/ˌmaɪkrəˈspɔːrɪk/
adjective
小孢子的
Relating to or producing microspores.  Microspores are the smaller of the two types of spores produced by some plants, typically developing into male gametophytes.
Microspores, unlike megaspores, are microsporic.
小孢子，不像大孢子，是小孢子的。
Fern plants produce microsporic spores.
蕨类植物产生小孢子的孢子。

Etymology:  From micro- (small) + -sporic (relating to spores), ultimately from Greek *mikrós* (small) and *sporá* (seed).
近义词: microspore-producing
反义词: megasporic
