nonparentally:/nɒnpəˈrɛntəli/ | adv. | 非亲本地; 非亲代地 | In genetics, refers to inheritance or transmission of traits that does not follow the typical parent-offspring pattern, often due to recombination or other genetic mechanisms.  |  The gene was transferred nonparentally through horizontal gene transfer.  该基因通过水平基因转移非亲本地转移。 |  non-Mendelian, atypically | parentally | adverb
