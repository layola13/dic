ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "to bleach," which comes from Middle English *blechen*, from Old English *blǣcan*, meaning "to whiten, to make pale."  Ultimately from Proto-Germanic *blaikijaną*.  The noun form referring to seating likely arose from the sun-bleached appearance of the wooden planks often used in their construction.
