The word "chegre" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it could be a regionalism, slang term, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered the word, what language you believe it to be), I may be able to offer more assistance.

Since I cannot analyze "chegre," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "happen":

happen:/ˈhæpən/ | v. | 发生，碰巧 | To occur, to take place, to come to pass. |
例句：The accident happened so fast. 事故发生得太快了。

例句：I happened to see him at the store. 我碰巧在商店看到他。

近义词：occur, transpire, befall | 反义词:  (No direct opposite, depends on context, perhaps "prevent") | 词性: verb
