From non- + proportionate + -ness.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," "opposite of."  "Proportionate" comes from Latin "proportionatus," past participle of "proporționare" meaning "to make proportional," from "pro" (for, according to) + "portio" (portion, share).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition.
