alumina:/əˈluːmɪnə/ | n. |氧化铝|Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃), a white crystalline substance that is used in the production of aluminum metal, ceramics, and abrasives.  It is amphoteric, meaning it can react as both an acid and a base.|例句：Alumina is a key ingredient in many types of ceramics. 氧化铝是许多类型陶瓷的关键成分。

例句：The alumina was extracted from bauxite. 氧化铝是从铝土矿中提取的。|近义词：aluminium oxide,  aluminum oxide |反义词: N/A |词性:noun


alumine: /æljʊˈmiːn/ | n. |矾土| An old, somewhat archaic term for alumina (aluminum oxide).  Generally, it refers to hydrated aluminum oxides, specifically aluminum hydroxide minerals. |例句：Alumine was traditionally used in dyeing processes.  矾土传统上用于染色工艺。

例句：The alumine deposits were rich in bauxite.  这些矾土矿床富含铝土矿。|近义词：alumina, bauxite (when referring to the ore) |反义词: N/A |词性: noun
