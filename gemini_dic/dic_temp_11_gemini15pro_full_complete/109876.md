lherzolite: /ˈlɜːrzəˌlaɪt/ | n. | 橄榄岩 | An ultramafic igneous rock, composed primarily of olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. It is a significant component of the Earth's mantle. |  Lherzolite is believed to be a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle. 橄榄岩被认为是地球上地幔的主要组成部分。

Lherzolite xenoliths brought up by volcanic eruptions offer valuable insights into the mantle's composition. 火山喷发带来的橄榄岩捕虏体为了解地幔成分提供了宝贵的线索。| 近义词: peridotite(广义的橄榄岩，包含lherzolite) | 反义词:  N/A (没有明确的反义词，因为它是岩石类型) | 词性: noun
