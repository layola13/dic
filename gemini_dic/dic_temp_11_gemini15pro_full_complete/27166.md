USAGE->

USAGE->
一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The system uses callbacks to handle events. = 系统使用回调来处理事件。

This library provides several callback functions. =  这个库提供了一些回调函数。


现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The application is executing the callback function right now. = 应用程序现在正在执行回调函数。

We are using callbacks to improve the responsiveness of the UI. = 我们正在使用回调来提高用户界面的响应速度。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The callback has already been executed. = 回调函数已经被执行了。

The system has successfully registered the callback. = 系统已成功注册回调。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The application has been using callbacks for efficient event handling. = 应用程序一直在使用回调函数来进行高效的事件处理。

We have been relying on callbacks to ensure real-time updates. = 我们一直依赖回调来确保实时更新。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The callback function returned an error. = 回调函数返回了一个错误。

The system triggered the callback when the event occurred. = 当事件发生时，系统触发了回调。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The application was processing the callback when the error occurred. = 当错误发生时，应用程序正在处理回调。

We were using callbacks to manage the asynchronous operations. = 我们当时正在使用回调来管理异步操作。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The callback had already finished executing before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，回调已经执行完毕。

The system had registered the callback before the event. = 系统在事件发生前已经注册了回调。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The application had been using callbacks for a while before we switched to a different approach. = 在我们切换到不同的方法之前，应用程序已经使用回调有一段时间了。

They had been relying on callbacks for real-time updates until the system crashed. =  他们一直依赖回调来进行实时更新，直到系统崩溃。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The callback will be executed when the data is received. = 当数据被接收时，回调将被执行。

The system will trigger the callback upon completion. = 系统将在完成后触发回调。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The application will be processing the callback at that time. = 应用程序将在那个时间点处理回调。

We will be using callbacks to handle the incoming data stream. = 我们将使用回调来处理传入的数据流。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The callback will have finished executing by the time you receive the notification. = 当你收到通知时，回调将已经执行完毕。

The system will have registered the callback before the next event. = 系统将在下一个事件之前注册回调。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The application will have been using callbacks for several years by the time the new version is released. = 到新版本发布时，应用程序将已经使用回调好几年了。

We will have been relying on callbacks for efficient communication for a long time. = 我们将长期依赖回调进行高效的沟通。


虚拟语气:
If the callback were defined correctly, it would execute without errors. = 如果回调定义正确，它将无错误地执行。

I wish the callback had returned the expected result. = 我希望回调返回了预期的结果。


被动语态:
The callback is triggered by the system. = 回调由系统触发。

The callback function was executed successfully. = 回调函数被成功执行。


疑问句:
Is this a synchronous callback or an asynchronous one? = 这是一个同步回调还是异步回调？

How do callbacks improve the performance of the application? = 回调如何提高应用程序的性能？


否定句:
This function doesn't accept any callbacks. = 此函数不接受任何回调。

The callback wasn't executed because of an error. = 由于错误，回调未被执行。

PHRASE->
register a callback = 注册一个回调
callback function = 回调函数
callback hell = 回调地狱
make a callback = 进行回拨
event callback = 事件回调
