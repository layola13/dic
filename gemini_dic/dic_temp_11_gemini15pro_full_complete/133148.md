Etymology:
nonetherealness is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "etherealness," which is derived from "ethereal" + "-ness."  "Ethereal" comes from the Late Latin "aethereus," meaning "of the upper air," ultimately from the Greek "aithēr," meaning "upper air, bright sky." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns indicating a state or quality.
