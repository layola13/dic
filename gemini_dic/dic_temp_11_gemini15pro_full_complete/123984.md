注意事项:

This response provides both American /ˈmɔːrmənɪst/ and British /ˈmɔːrmənɪst/ pronunciations, which are the same in this case.

It uses the term "Mormonist" cautiously and explains its potentially offensive nature, prioritizing the preferred terms.  It also explains the lack of a true antonym.
