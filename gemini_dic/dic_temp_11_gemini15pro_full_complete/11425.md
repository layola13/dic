The word "argis" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a specialized term in a specific field.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I can try to offer a more helpful response.


However, since the prompt requests explanations of grammatical concepts using "what," I will provide that information below.  Please note that the following explanation uses "what" as the target word, since "argis" is not a valid English word.
