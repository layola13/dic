##palatalisms: /pælˈeɪtəlɪzəm/| n. | 颚化；腭音化 |解析:** Palatalization is a phonetic process where a consonant sound is modified by the tongue approaching the hard palate (the roof of the mouth). This often leadsto a change in the articulation of the consonant, making it sound softer or higher in pitch.  It can involve a shift in the place of articulation, themanner of articulation, or both. For instance, a consonant that was originally alveolar (produced with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, like /t/) might become palatal (produced with the tongue nearer the hard palate, potentially shifting to asound like /tʃ/).  The degree of palatalization can vary significantly across languages.  Palatalization is a common phonological process found in many languages throughout the world, contributing to sound changes and variations within language families. It's often linked to the influence of neighboring vowel sounds (especially high vowels like /i/ and /u/).。modification (of articulation)源:**  The word "palatalization" comes from the Latin word "palatum," meaning "palate."
