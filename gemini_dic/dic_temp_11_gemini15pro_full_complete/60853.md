electroviscosity:/ɪˌlɛktroʊvɪsˈkɒsɪti/ | n. | 电粘性 | The increase in viscosity of a fluid caused by an applied electric field.  It describes the phenomenon where the viscosity of a fluid, typically a colloid or suspension, increases when subjected to an electric field. | The electroviscosity of the ferrofluid increased dramatically when the magnetic field was applied. 磁场施加后，铁磁流体的电粘性急剧增加。

The researchers measured the electroviscosity of the suspension to determine the optimal electric field strength. 研究人员测量了悬浮液的电粘性，以确定最佳电场强度。 | 近义词: apparent viscosity (表观粘度),  effective viscosity (有效粘度)| 反义词: N/A | noun
