ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *dēprīvātiōn- (stem of dēprīvātiō), from Latin dēprīvāre (to deprive), from dē- (from, away from) + prīvāre (to deprive), from prīvus (private, one's own).  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *prei- (before, in front of), also the source of private.  The sense evolution is from "setting apart as one's own" to "taking away what belongs to another".
