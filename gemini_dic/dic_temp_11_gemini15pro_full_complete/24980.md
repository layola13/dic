词源:  Derived from Italian *brusso*, itself from earlier *russo*, from Late Latin *Rūssus*, ultimately from the East Slavic ethnonym Rus'.  The form *brusso* likely arose through dissimilation (avoiding repetition of the 'r' sound).  The term is now largely archaic or dialectal and has been superseded by "Russian".
