Etymology:
From "ambush" + "-like." "Ambush" comes from Old French "embusche" (noun), "embuschier" (verb), meaning "to place in ambush," ultimately from Vulgar Latin "*inboscare," from Latin "in-" (in) + "*boscus" (bush).  "-like" is a common suffix forming adjectives meaning "resembling" or "characteristic of."
