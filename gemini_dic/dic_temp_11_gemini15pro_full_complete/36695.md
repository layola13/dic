词源:  "Colling" likely arises from the verb "to cool" which originates from the Old French "coler," meaning "to cool, refresh." This in turn is derived from the Latin "colare," meaning "to filter, strain, percolate," which developed a sense of cooling due to the association of strained liquids with a lower temperature.

注意事项：While "colling" is grammatically correct as a present participle of "to cool," in modern English, "cooling" is the overwhelmingly preferred and more common spelling.  Using "colling" might sound archaic or even incorrect to some native speakers.  It's advisable to use "cooling" in most contexts.
