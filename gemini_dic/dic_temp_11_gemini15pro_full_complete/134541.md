nonlinkage:/ˌnɒnˈlɪŋkɪdʒ/| n.|非连锁|The absence of genetic linkage; the situation where two genes are located on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome, so that they assort independently during meiosis.|Example 1: The nonlinkage of these two traits suggests they are on different chromosomes. 这两个性状的非连锁表明它们位于不同的染色体上。

Example 2: Nonlinkage between genes results in a higher frequency of recombination. 基因间的非连锁导致更高的重组频率。|Synonym: independent assortment|Antonym: linkage|noun
