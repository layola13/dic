"isagel" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could it be a misspelling of "is a gel"?  If so, it's not one word but three.
* **A proper noun:**  Perhaps a name, a place, or a product.
* **A technical term:** Possibly specific to a particular field.
* **A neologism:**  A newly coined word.

If you can provide more context, like where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.

Since I can't analyze "isagel," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. |
例句：What is your name? 你叫什么名字？

例句：What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！

近义词：which, how | 反义词: (No direct antonym) | 词性: pronoun, determiner, adverb
