covariance:/koʊˈveəriəns/| n.|协方差，共变异数|A measure of the joint variability of two random variables.  It indicates how much two variables change together. A positive covariance suggests that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance suggests they tend to move in opposite directions.  A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the variables.|The covariance between stock prices and interest rates was negative. 股票价格和利率之间的协方差为负。|近义词：correlation, dependence|反义词:independence|词性:noun


Etymology:
From co- + variance.  Variance itself comes from vary, ultimately from Latin *variāre.
