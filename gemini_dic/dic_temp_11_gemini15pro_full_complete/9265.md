antipeptone:/ˈæntiˌpepˌtoʊn/
n.
抗胨
A substance that resists digestion by peptones.  It is the portion of a protein that is not converted to peptones by peptic digestion.
The experiment showed that the antipeptone fraction was not further degraded by pepsin.  该实验表明，抗胨部分不会被胃蛋白酶进一步降解。
近义词: indigestible protein, resistant protein
反义词: peptone, peptide
词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From anti- + peptone.  Anti- meaning "against" or "opposed to", and peptone referring to a soluble protein formed in the early stages of protein breakdown during digestion.
