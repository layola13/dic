ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French amuser (“to entertain, divert, beguile”) + -ment (suffix forming nouns from verbs), from Latin *minutiare, frequentative of minuere (“to lessen, diminish”). The sense development in French was likely influenced by muse (“daydream, reverie”).

词源: 源自古法语 amuser（“娱乐、转移、欺骗”）+ -ment（从动词构成名词的后缀），来自拉丁语 *minutiare，minuere（“减少、缩小”）的重复形式。法语中的意义发展可能受到 muse（“白日梦、幻想”）的影响。
