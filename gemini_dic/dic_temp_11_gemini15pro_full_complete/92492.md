词性: adjective

词源: From Greek *hypothenal*, from *hypo* (under) + *thesis* (a placing, proposition).  The word likely arose as a variant spelling or misinterpretation of "hypothetical," influenced by words like "diagonal" or "orthogonal."  It is not a standard English word and is considered a misspelling or archaic form.  Use "hypothetical" instead.
