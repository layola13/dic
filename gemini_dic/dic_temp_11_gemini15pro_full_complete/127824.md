nematocyst: /ˈnɛmətəsɪst/ | n. | 刺丝囊 | A specialized cell in the tentacles of a jellyfish or other coelenterate, containing a barbed or venomous coiled thread that can be projected in self-defense or to capture prey. |  The jellyfish's nematocysts injected venom into the swimmer. 水母的刺丝囊将毒液注入游泳者体内。| synonym: cnidocyst, stinging cell | antonym: N/A | noun

nematocyst: /ˈnɛmətəsɪst/ | n. | 刺细胞 | A minute, elongated, or spherical capsule produced exclusively by members of the phylum Cnidaria (e.g., jellyfish, corals, sea anemones). It contains a coiled, hollow, usually barbed thread, which quickly turns outward (is everted) from the capsule upon proper stimulation. Contact by a small animal may trigger discharge of the nematocyst, which can penetrate the skin and inject a paralyzing toxin. The nematocyst also aids in capturing prey and in locomotion.  | The sea anemone uses its nematocysts to stun and capture small fish. 海葵用它的刺细胞来击晕和捕获小鱼。| synonym: cnidoblast, stinging organelle | antonym: N/A | noun
