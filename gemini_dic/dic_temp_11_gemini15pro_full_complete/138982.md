Etymology:
From "nymph" + "-like." "Nymph" comes from the Late Middle English "nymfe," borrowed from the Old French "nife," which ultimately derives from the Latin "nympha" and Greek "nýmphē," meaning "bride," "young woman," or "minor female deity associated with nature." The suffix "-like" is Old English in origin, meaning "having the characteristics of."
