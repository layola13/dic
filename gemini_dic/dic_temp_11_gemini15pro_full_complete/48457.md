ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *dēman (attested only in the past participle gedēmed), "to judge, pronounce a judgment, decree, doom," from Proto-Germanic *dōmijaną ("to judge, deem"), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁- (“to put, place, set”). Cognate with Old Frisian dēma ("to judge, deem"), Old Saxon dōmian ("to judge, deem"), Old High German tuomen ("to judge, deem"), Old Norse dæma ("to judge, deem"), Gothic 𐌳𐍉𐌼𐌾𐌰𐌽 (dōmjan, “to judge”).  The original sense of “pronounce judgment” weakened to “form a judgment” and then to “think, suppose.”
