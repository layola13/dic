chemiotaxis:/ˌkɛmiːoʊˈtæksɪs/ /ˌkiːmiːəʊˈtæksɪs/| n. |趋化性；化学趋向性|The movement of an organism or cell in response to a chemical stimulus.  The stimulus may be either attractive (positive chemotaxis) or repulsive (negative chemotaxis).|White blood cells exhibit chemotaxis to move towards sites of infection. 白细胞表现出趋化性，向感染部位移动。

Bacteria use chemotaxis to find food sources.  细菌利用趋化性寻找食物来源。|近义词：chemotaxis (often used interchangeably), chemical taxis|反义词: None|词性:noun


Etymology:
From chemo- + taxis.  Chemo- comes from Greek khēmeia "alchemy," and taxis from Greek taxis "arrangement, order."
