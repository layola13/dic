ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *espleitier, from Latin explicitus "unfolded, set forth," past participle of explicare "to unfold, explain," from ex- "out" + plicare "to fold."  The original sense in English was "to achieve or accomplish successfully," later shifting to "make use of" and then acquiring the negative connotation of "take unfair advantage of."
