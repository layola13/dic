ETYMOLOGY->
The term "nerf" originated as slang in the online gaming community, particularly in role-playing games. It's believed to be derived from the name of the Nerf brand of toy guns, which are considered relatively harmless compared to other types of toy weaponry.  The implication is that a "nerfed" item or ability in a game has been made less powerful or effective, akin to being hit by a soft Nerf dart instead of something more damaging.  Over time, the term has moved beyond gaming and become more general slang for weakening or reducing something's effectiveness.
