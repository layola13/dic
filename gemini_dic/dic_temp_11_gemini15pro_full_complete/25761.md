burbolt: /ˈbɜːrboʊlt/ (This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very niche technical term.) | n. |  (Possibly) 刺果;带刺的螺栓;毛刺螺栓 |  This word is not recognized in standard dictionaries.  It seems to be a combination of "burr" (a rough, prickly seed case) and "bolt" (a metal fastener).  Therefore, it could potentially refer to a bolt with burrs on it, or a type of seed pod with a bolt-like shape.  Without more context, its exact meaning is unclear. | No reliable examples available due to the word's uncertain status.  |  If referring to a bolt with burrs: bolt, fastener.  If referring to a seed pod: burr, seed pod. | (No reliable antonyms available due to the word's uncertain status.) | noun
