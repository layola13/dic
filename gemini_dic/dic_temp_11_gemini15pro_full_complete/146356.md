overfitting:/ˌoʊvərˈfɪtɪŋ/| n.|过拟合|A phenomenon in statistics and machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it negatively impacts the model's performance on new, unseen data.  It essentially memorizes the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. |The complex model showed signs of overfitting, performing poorly on the test dataset.  这个复杂的模型表现出过拟合的迹象，在测试数据集上表现不佳。|近义词：overtraining|反义词: underfitting|名词


overfit:/ˌoʊvərˈfɪt/| v. |过拟合|To train a statistical model to such an extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data due to excessive memorization of the training data. | We overfit the model to the training data, resulting in poor generalization. 我们将模型过度拟合到训练数据，导致泛化能力差。 |近义词：overtrain|反义词: underfit|动词


ETYMOLOGY->
"Over-" (prefix indicating excess) + "fit" (verb, to be the right shape or size).  The term gained prominence in the fields of statistics and machine learning.
