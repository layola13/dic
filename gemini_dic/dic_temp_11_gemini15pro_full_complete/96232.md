注意事项:

*  使用 "Indians" 指代美洲原住民被广泛认为是具有冒犯性的。更合适的术语包括 "Native Americans", "First Nations" (在加拿大), 或 "Indigenous peoples".  当指代来自印度的人时，"Indians" 是可以接受的，但 "Indian people" 更为正式和尊重。


词源: From Old French *indien (adj.), from Latin Indicus "Indian," from Indus (genitive Indi), the name of the river.  Originally referring to people from the East Indies. The application to Native Americans arose from Columbus's mistaken belief that he had reached the Indies.
