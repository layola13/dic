ETYMOLOGY->

From the verb "kedge" (meaning to secure a ship with a kedge anchor), which in turn comes from the Middle English "kegge," likely of Scandinavian origin.  The sense of "kedger" as a bookkeeper may have arisen from the meticulous and careful nature of securing a ship, which is mirrored in the careful keeping of accounts.
