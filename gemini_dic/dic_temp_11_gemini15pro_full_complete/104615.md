kapmoth is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It likely has either been misspelled, is a newly coined word, or is specific to a very niche field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical entry.

However, if you meant "cap moth," which refers to certain moths in the family Geometridae, I can provide some information. Note that "cap moth" isn't a standardized taxonomic term, but rather a descriptive name for moths whose wings resemble a cap when at rest.
