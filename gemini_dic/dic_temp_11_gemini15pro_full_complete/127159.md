ETYMOLOGY->
From natural + historian.  "Natural history" dates back to the 16th century, referring to the study of natural objects, especially in their environment. "Historian" comes from the Old French "historieor" and ultimately from the Greek "histor," meaning "learned man" or "one who knows."  The combination "natural-historian" naturally followed, denoting a person specializing in this field.
