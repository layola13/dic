Etymology:
gab (n.) "idle talk," 1808, American English, probably from gab (v.) "to talk idly," 1785, of uncertain origin. Perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare dialectal Norwegian gabba "to mock," gabben "mouth, beak"), or from Middle Dutch gabben "to mock, scoff," related to Old English gabban "to scoff."  The noun form is first recorded in the compound gabble-fest (1869). Fest "celebration, festival" comes from German Fest, from Middle High German vest, from Old High German feist, from Proto-Germanic *festiz, from PIE *dhes-ti- "religious rite, feast" (source also of Sanskrit dasti- "religious service, reward, gift," Avestan dasti- "offering," Greek thestes "one who petitions the gods," Latin festus "festive, joyful, solemn," Old Church Slavonic desti "feast").
