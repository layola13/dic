gemmiparity:/ˌdʒɛmɪˈpærɪti/ | n. | 芽殖，芽生 | Reproduction by budding, where new individuals develop as outgrowths from the parent organism, eventually detaching to become independent organisms. | Example 1: Gemmiparity is a common form of asexual reproduction in certain invertebrates, such as sponges and hydras. 芽殖是某些无脊椎动物（如海绵和水螅）常见的无性繁殖方式。

Example 2:  The hydra exhibits gemmiparity, forming buds that develop into miniature versions of itself. 水螅表现出芽生，形成发育成其微型版本的新芽。 | Synonym: budding | Antonym: N/A | noun
