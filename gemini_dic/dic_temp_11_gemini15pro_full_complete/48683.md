ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *deferren*, from Old French *deferrer*, from Latin *dīfferre* ("to carry apart, scatter, disperse, spread, put off, delay, defer"), from *dis-* ("apart, asunder, in different directions") + *ferre* ("to carry, bear").  The sense of "yielding to another's wish or opinion" arose from the sense of "putting aside one's own wishes."
