l-glucoses:/ˌɛlˈɡluːkoʊsiz/| n. |左旋葡萄糖|A stereoisomer of glucose; a simple sugar molecule that is the mirror image of d-glucose.  L-glucose is rarely found in nature and is not metabolized by most organisms.|L-glucose is being investigated for potential uses as a sweetener that doesn't raise blood sugar. 左旋葡萄糖正在被研究作为一种不会升高血糖的甜味剂的潜在用途。|L-glucose is not easily absorbed by the body and therefore does not significantly impact blood glucose levels.  左旋葡萄糖不易被人体吸收，因此不会显著影响血糖水平。|Synonym: (rarely used - often referred to by its full name) l-glucose|Antonym: d-glucose|Noun
