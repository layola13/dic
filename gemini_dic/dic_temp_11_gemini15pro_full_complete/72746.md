词源:
The origin of "fogey" is uncertain, but it may be related to the now obsolete "fogy," meaning a soldier or invalid.  One theory suggests it referred to elderly or disabled soldiers who were perceived as being out of touch with current affairs. Another possible origin is the dialectal word "fogram," meaning an old-fashioned person.
