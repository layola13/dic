greenage's:/ˈɡriːnɪdʒɪz/ | n. | 青春时代; 青葱岁月 |  "Greenage" itself isn't a standard English word. It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "green" (symbolizing youth and freshness) and "age" (referring to a period of time).  The apostrophe + "s" indicates possession, so "greenage's" means "belonging to or associated with one's greenage/youth." |  The vibrancy of greenage's memories stayed with her. 青春时代的鲜活记忆一直伴随着她。 | 近义词: youth, adolescence, springtime of life | 反义词: old age, declining years | 词性: 名词 (formed from a non-standard noun)
