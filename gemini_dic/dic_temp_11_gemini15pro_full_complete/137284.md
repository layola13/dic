nonsynchronousness:/ˌnɒnˈsɪŋkrənəsnəs/ /ˌnɑːnˈsɪŋkrənəsnəs/| n. |非同步性，异步性|The state or quality of not being synchronous; lack of synchronization.|The nonsynchronousness of the data streams caused problems in the analysis.|近义词：asynchrony, non-simultaneity, out-of-sync|反义词：synchronousness, synchrony, simultaneity|词性:名词

Etymology:
non- (prefix):  Meaning "not," from Latin non.
