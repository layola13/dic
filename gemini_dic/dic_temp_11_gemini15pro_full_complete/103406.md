词源： "Jippo" is likely a variant of "gyp," which is a slang term for "cheat" or "swindle." "Gyp" is thought to be derived from "Gypsy," reflecting historical prejudices and stereotypes associating the Romani people with dishonesty.  While the exact origin of "jippo" is unclear, its meaning and usage are closely related to "gyp" and other similar slang terms for deceitful practices.
