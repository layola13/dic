词源： "offertorial" is a portmanteau word, combining "offer" (suggesting a proposal or promotion) and "editorial" (a newspaper article expressing the editor's opinion).  It highlights the dual nature of the content – presented as editorial material but serving a promotional purpose.  "Advertorial" is a more common synonym with similar etymology (advertisement + editorial).
