PHRASE->
(This word is not commonly used in phrases.  It is a very technical and infrequent word.)

词源: non- (prefix meaning "not") + lubricous (meaning "smooth or slippery") + -ness (suffix forming nouns from adjectives).  Therefore, nonlubriciousness means the state of being not smooth or slippery.
