注意事项:
KitKat 的发音中，第一个 k 的发音很轻，几乎听不到。

词源:  Rowntree's, a confectionery company in York, England, first introduced the Kit Cat (originally two separate words) in the 1930s.  The name's origin is uncertain, but one theory links it to the Kit-Cat Club, a literary and political club in 18th-century London.  Nestlé acquired Rowntree's in 1988.  The name became "KitKat" sometime in the 1930s.
