The word "meler" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's a highly specialized term, a proper noun, or from a different language.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered the word, its intended meaning, or any other relevant information), I can try to offer a more accurate analysis.


Since I can't analyze "meler," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what /wɒt/ (US) /wɑːt/ (UK) |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 |Used to ask for information about something or someone. |
What is your name? 你叫什么名字？
