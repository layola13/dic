opcode:/ˈɑːpkəʊd/ (UK) /ˈɑːpkod/ (US)| n.|操作码|A sequence of bits that instructs a computer's central processing unit to perform a particular operation.|The opcode for addition is typically shorter than the opcode for multiplication.|近义词: instruction code, operation code|反义词: N/A|名词

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The opcode specifies the operation to be executed. = 操作码指定要执行的操作。
Each opcode corresponds to a specific machine instruction. = 每个操作码对应一条特定的机器指令。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The CPU is fetching the opcode from memory. = CPU 正在从内存中提取操作码。
The system is decoding the opcode to determine the next action. = 系统正在解码操作码以确定下一步操作。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The program has executed the opcode successfully. = 程序已成功执行操作码。
The computer has processed millions of opcodes since it was turned on. = 自打开以来，计算机已经处理了数百万个操作码。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The processor has been fetching opcodes continuously for hours. = 处理器已连续数小时获取操作码。
The system has been decoding and executing opcodes without interruption. = 系统一直在不间断地解码和执行操作码。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The CPU fetched the opcode from the instruction register. = CPU 从指令寄存器中提取了操作码。
The program executed the opcode and moved to the next instruction. = 程序执行了操作码并移至下一条指令。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The computer was processing the opcode when the power failed. = 断电时，计算机正在处理操作码。
The CPU was decoding the opcode while the data was being fetched. = CPU 正在解码操作码，同时正在获取数据。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The CPU had already fetched the opcode before the interrupt occurred. = 在中断发生之前，CPU 已经提取了操作码。
The program had executed the opcode several times before the error was detected. = 在检测到错误之前，程序已经多次执行了操作码。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been processing opcodes for hours before it crashed. = 系统崩溃前已经处理操作码数小时了。
The CPU had been fetching opcodes continuously before the power surge. = 在电源浪涌之前，CPU 一直在连续获取操作码。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The CPU will fetch the next opcode from memory. = CPU 将从内存中提取下一个操作码。
The program will execute the opcode according to the instruction set. = 程序将根据指令集执行操作码。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The CPU will be fetching opcodes from the cache memory. = CPU 将从缓存中提取操作码。
The system will be decoding and executing opcodes in real time. = 系统将实时解码和执行操作码。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the cycle, the CPU will have executed the opcode. = 到周期结束时，CPU 将已经执行了操作码。
The program will have processed all the opcodes in the sequence. = 程序将已经处理了序列中的所有操作码。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next year, the new processor will have been executing opcodes at twice the speed. = 到明年，新处理器将以两倍的速度执行操作码。
The system will have been processing complex opcodes efficiently for a decade. = 该系统将高效地处理复杂操作码十年。


虚拟语气:
If the opcode were different, the result would be different. = 如果操作码不同，结果也会不同。
I wish I knew the meaning of this opcode. = 我希望我知道这个操作码的含义。

被动语态:
The opcode is fetched from memory by the CPU. = 操作码由 CPU 从内存中提取。
The opcode was executed successfully. = 操作码已成功执行。

疑问句:
What does this opcode represent? = 这个操作码代表什么？
Which opcode is used for multiplication? = 哪个操作码用于乘法？

否定句:
This opcode does not perform a logical operation. = 此操作码不执行逻辑运算。
The program did not recognize the opcode. = 程序无法识别操作码。

PHRASE->
invalid opcode = 无效的操作码
decode an opcode = 解码操作码
execute an opcode = 执行操作码
fetch an opcode = 获取操作码
opcode mnemonic = 操作码助记符
