feiest:/ˈfaɪstɪst/| adj.| 最喜庆的; 最欢乐的 | This is the feiest celebration we've ever had. 这是我们举办过的最欢乐的庆典。|  This is the feiest party of the year. 这是年度最喜庆的派对。 | 近义词: most festive, most joyous, most cheerful | 反义词: most somber, most gloomy, most depressing | 词性: 形容词 (Superlative adjective of "feisty")

词源:  "Feiest" is the superlative form of "feisty," which originally meant "small and lively."  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's thought to be related to "fist" and perhaps influenced by dialectal words suggesting spirit or liveliness. Over time, the meaning shifted to describe someone spirited, lively, and even a bit touchy. "Feiest" simply intensifies this quality to the highest degree.
