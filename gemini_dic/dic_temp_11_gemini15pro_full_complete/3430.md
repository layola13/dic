注意事项：
*  "Africander" is an older term, and "Afrikaner" is the preferred and more common term today.  While both refer to people of European descent in South Africa, particularly those of Dutch origin, using "Africander" can be seen as outdated or even offensive in some contexts.  It's crucial to be mindful of this distinction.
