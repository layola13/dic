词源:  The term "highball" likely originated in the late 19th century in the United States. One theory suggests it refers to the practice of serving drinks in tall glasses, which were sometimes called "highball glasses." Another theory links the name to the early days of railroading, where a ball mounted on a tall pole signaled that the track was clear for the train to proceed at full speed ("high ball").
