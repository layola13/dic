##parabronchium 的详细解析ˈbrɒŋkiəm/ | n. | 肺小管 |**the alveoli in mammalian lungs, parabronchi are continuous tubes that allow unidirectional airflow.

They are thin-walled tubes that connect to air capillaries, where gas exchange takes place. The structure of parabronchi enables birds to maintain efficient respiration even during demanding activities like flight.**例句:**chi to understand avian respiratory physiology. 研究人员研究了肺小管的结构和功能，以了解鸟类的呼吸生理学。**反义词:** (No direct antonym exists.)  alveolus (in the context of mammalian lungs, which have a different structure).near," or "beyond."beside or near the bronchi," reflecting its location within the avian respiratory system.
