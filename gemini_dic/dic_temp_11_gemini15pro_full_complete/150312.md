##pangenesis:/ˌpænˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/ | n. |泛生论|angenesis is a hypothetical theory of heredity proposing that all body parts contribute to the reproductive material. This theory, primarily associated with Charles Darwin, suggests that gemmules, tiny particles representing each body part, are shed and collected in the reproductive organs. These gemmules are then passed on to offspring during reproduction, influencingtheir characteristics.  Darwin's concept, while ultimately proven incorrect, was an attempt to explain how traits are inherited, predating the discovery of genes and DNA. The theory lacked experimental evidence and was superseded by Mendelian genetics and later discoveriesin molecular biology which demonstrated that inheritance is mediated by genes, located on chromosomes within the germ cells.  However, the concept of pangenesis holds a significant place in the history of genetics as a milestone in understanding inheritance.  Its failureultimately spurred further research and contributed to more accurate models of heredity.。尽管最终被证明是错误的，组成部分。but contrasting theories could be mentioned): Mendelian genetics, chromosomal theory of inheritance.Thus, the term accurately reflects the core idea of the theory: the whole body contributes to the creation of the next generation.biological discussions, superseded by more accurate models. However, understanding pangenesis remains relevant for appreciating the history of genetics and the evolution of scientific understanding of heredity.  The term may also occasionally appear in discussions of the philosophy of science, particularly when considering the nature of scientific progress through the testing and modification of ideas.
