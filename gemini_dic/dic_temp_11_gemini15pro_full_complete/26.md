注意事项:

The term "a-man-of-color" while historically used, is now considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its broad and imprecise nature, and the historical context of racial discrimination.  It's important to use more specific and respectful terms when referring to individuals, such as referring to their specific ethnic or racial background if known and appropriate in the context.  For example, "a Black man," "a Latino man," or "an Asian man."  If the specific background is unknown or irrelevant, "person of color" is a more acceptable general term.
