The word "mutic" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a technical term specific to a niche field, or a neologism.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, what it pertains to), I can try to help further.

However, assuming you meant "mute" or possibly intended a word with a similar root, I can offer an analysis of "mute":

mute:/mjuːt/ (UK) /mjut/ (US)| adj. n. v.| 沉默的；无声的；哑的；弱化的；（颜色）柔和的 | a person unable to speak, especially from birth.  A device for silencing or muffling the sound of a musical instrument.|  The child was born mute.  He hit the mute button on the remote.
