The word "lingence" is not a valid English word. It appears to be a fragment, possibly intended to be part of a longer word like "intelligence."  Therefore, I will provide an analysis of "intelligence":

intelligence: /ɪnˈtɛlɪdʒəns/ | n. | 智力，情报，理解力 | The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. |  He showed high intelligence from an early age. 他从小就表现出很高的智力。| synonyms: intellect, mind, brainpower | antonyms: stupidity, ignorance | noun
