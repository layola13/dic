discriminant:/dɪˈskrɪmɪnənt/| n. |判别式，区别因素|A function of the coefficients of a polynomial equation whose value gives information about the roots of the polynomial.  It's commonly represented by the symbol Δ (delta).  In the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b² - 4ac.|The discriminant of the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 is 1.  Therefore, the equation has two distinct real roots.| 近义词:determinant, differentiator| 反义词: N/A| noun

discriminant:/dɪˈskrɪmɪnənt/| adj. |有区别的，歧视的|Serving to distinguish; characteristic; distinctive.  (This usage is less common than the noun form.)| The discriminant feature of this species is its bright red plumage.| 近义词: distinctive, characteristic, differentiating | 反义词:indistinguishable, similar| adjective
