注意事项:

The word "English's" is not commonly used.  It is generally more natural to use "England's" when referring to something possessed by England, or "English" when referring to the language itself or its characteristics (e.g., "English grammar," "English literature"). Using "English's" can sound awkward or incorrect in many cases.  The provided examples demonstrate grammatically correct usage in different tenses, but using alternatives like "England's" or "English" is often preferred in real-world communication.
