The word "gendali" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from a specific dialect or language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a lexical analysis for it.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it comes from or the situation in which you encountered it, I might be able to offer more assistance.

Since I cannot analyze "gendali," I'll use the word "what" as an example to demonstrate the requested format:

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. int. | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
