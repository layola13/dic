词源：From Late Latin *mūcus, from Latin mūcus (“mucus”).

注意事项:  While "mucuses" is grammatically correct as the plural of "mucus," it is less common than simply using "mucus" in a plural context. For example, "The patient had a lot of mucus" is generally preferred over "The patient had a lot of mucuses."
