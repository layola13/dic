```ˌsuːdoʊˈpoʊdiəm/| n. |伪足，假足|英文解析：A temporary protrusion of the cytoplasm of a cell, used for locomotion or engulfing food.  It's atemporary extension of a cell's cytoplasm, acting as a 'foot' for movement or capturing food.  Pseudopodia are characteristic of amoebas andother single-celled organisms.  The term combines "pseudo" (false) and "podium" (foot).|例句：Amoebas use pseudopodia to move around and capture prey.变形虫利用伪足移动并捕获猎物。|近义词：protrusion, extension, process|反义词：  N/A (it's more about the absence of a permanent appendage)|词性：名词词源:**to "false foot."  This perfectly describes its function as a temporary, cytoplasm-based extension used for movement and feeding, unlike the true legs or appendages of multicellular organisms.biology contexts. It describes the dynamic cellular projections found in various organisms, including:surround food.animals, also exhibit pseudopodia as a means of movement and nutrient acquisition.of these projections is an energy-dependent process.  The specific mechanisms vary slightly depending upon the organism and type of pseudopodia involved (lobopodia, filopodia, reticulopodia, axopodia, etc.).is a critical term for understanding the behaviour, movement and feeding processes of various single-celled organisms and some specialized cells within multicellular organisms.  Understanding pseudopodia provides deeper insight into cell biology and evolutionary processes.✩伪足的形成过程中，肌动蛋白细丝的具体动态及调控机制有哪些尚未被完全揭示的方面？变形虫、白细胞和黏菌，还有哪些生物体也运用类似伪足的结构进行运动或摄食，其机制有何异同？
