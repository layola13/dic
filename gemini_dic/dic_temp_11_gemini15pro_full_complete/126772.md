nanobacterium: /ˈnænoʊbækˈtɪəriəm/ | n. | 纳米细菌 | A proposed class of extremely small bacteria, smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life.  Their existence and role in various diseases are controversial and not widely accepted by the scientific community. |  Researchers claimed to have found nanobacteria in Martian meteorites. 研究人员声称在火星陨石中发现了纳米细菌。 |  Nanobacteria were thought to be involved in kidney stone formation. 纳米细菌被认为与肾结石的形成有关。 | 近义词:  (No widely accepted synonyms due to the contested nature of nanobacteria.  Potentially "calcifying nanoparticles" if referring to the observed phenomenon.) | 反义词: (None) | 词性: noun
