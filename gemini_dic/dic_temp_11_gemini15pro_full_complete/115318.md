The word "manness's" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a mistaken formation, likely intended to be a possessive form of a hypothetical noun "manness."  While "manliness" exists, "manness" does not.  Therefore, a complete linguistic breakdown as requested is not possible.  However, I can offer an analysis based on the likely intended meaning and how to correctly express it.

Assuming the intended meaning is "the quality of being a man" or something belonging to this quality, the correct word to use would be "manliness."  Here's the breakdown for "manliness" and its possessive form:


manliness: /ˈmænlinəs/ | n. | 男子气概，阳刚之气 | The quality of being manly; masculine spirit or behavior. | He demonstrated great manliness in the face of danger. 他在危险面前表现出极大的男子气概。 |  masculinity, virility | femininity, effeminacy | noun

manliness's: /ˈmænlinəsɪz/ | n. (possessive) | 男子气概的…  |  Belonging to or associated with the quality of manliness. | Manliness's appeal has changed over time. 男子气概的吸引力随着时间的推移而改变。 | masculinity's, virility's |  femininity's, effeminacy's | noun
