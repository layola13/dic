词源：
The origin of "balderdash" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it may be related to a mixture of liquids, possibly a frothy or worthless drink, in the 16th century. Another connects it to "bald" in the sense of "worthless" or "empty."  Its current meaning of "nonsense" became established by the 17th century.
