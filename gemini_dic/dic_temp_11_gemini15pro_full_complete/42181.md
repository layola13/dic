词源:  "Couldnt" is a contraction of "could not." "Could" is the past tense of "can," which comes from Old English *cunnan "to know, be able," related to Old Norse kenna "to know," Gothic kann "I know," German kennen "to know." The original sense was "to have power to do something because of having the knowledge or skill."
