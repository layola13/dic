From "grotty" + "-er" (comparative suffix).  "Grotty" is likely a shortened form of "grotesque," with a change in pronunciation and a shift in meaning towards general unpleasantness.  "Grotesque" ultimately comes from Italian "grottesca," referring to decorative paintings found in ancient Roman grottoes.
