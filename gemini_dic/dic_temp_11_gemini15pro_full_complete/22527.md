词源：

This word originated in the 1930s as a term for a braided leather or cord handicraft, often made by Boy Scouts.  It later evolved to describe any wasteful or unproductive activity, possibly because the handicraft itself was seen as frivolous or unnecessary.  This shift in meaning likely occurred during the Great Depression, when government spending was closely scrutinized.
这个词起源于20世纪30年代，指的是一种编织的皮革或绳索工艺品，通常由童子军制作。后来演变为描述任何浪费或无用的活动，可能是因为工艺品本身被视为轻浮或不必要的。这种意义上的转变可能发生在大萧条时期，当时政府支出受到密切审查。
