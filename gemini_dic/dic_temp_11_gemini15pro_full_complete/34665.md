ETYMOLOGY->
From clergy + woman. "Clergy" comes from Old French clergie, from Late Latin clericus "cleric," from Greek klerikos "of the clergy," from kleros "lot, inheritance, allotted portion."  Originally, it referred to the portion or inheritance of God, i.e., the Church. "Woman" comes from Old English wifman, meaning "female human being."
