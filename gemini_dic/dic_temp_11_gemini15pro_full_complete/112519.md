词源：From Old French *loverie "watchtower, lookout post," from Frankish *laubja "covered balcony, gallery," from Proto-Germanic *laubjo, related to *laubiz "foliage; shelter." The semantic shift to "window covering" probably occurred through the association with the slats of a louver resembling foliage.  The Louvre Palace in Paris, originally a fortress with a watchtower, took its name from this word.
