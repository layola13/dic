ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *decantatio, from Latin decantare (“to pour off”), from de- (“down, away from”) + cantare (“to sing, enchant”).  The original sense was related to magical incantations or charms.  The modern meaning developed from the idea of pouring off a liquid as if separating it from a spell or impurity.
