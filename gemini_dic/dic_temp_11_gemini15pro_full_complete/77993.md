ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *gentil (modern French gentil), from Latin gentilis "of the same clan or family; related by blood; of the same nation," also "noble, high-born," from gens (genitive gentis) "clan, family, nation, people, race," of unknown origin. The semantic development in Old French involved notions of "noble, courteous, polite," which broadened to "mild, soft" in Middle English.
