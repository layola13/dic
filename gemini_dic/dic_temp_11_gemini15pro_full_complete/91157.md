Etymology: From "hydra" (水螅) + "-ens" (pluralizing suffix, indicating a group or collection).  The word "hydra" itself comes from Greek "ὕδρα" (hýdra), meaning "water serpent," referring to the mythical creature's ability to regenerate lost heads.  The "-ens" suffix is similar to other collective suffixes like "-ia" (e.g., "militia") or "-ery" (e.g., "bakery").
