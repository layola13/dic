词源:  "iso-" (equal) + "-thermos" (heat) + "-ombros" (rain). Although the "-thermos" part might seem confusing,  the term was originally coined in analogy with "isotherm" (lines of equal temperature). The "ombros" part comes from the Greek "ombros" meaning rain.  So, it literally means "lines of equal rainfall".
