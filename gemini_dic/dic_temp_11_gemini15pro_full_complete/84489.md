ETYMOLOGY->
From haltingness + -es (plural suffix).  Haltingness itself comes from halting (adjective), meaning "hesitant or faltering,"  + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality).  Halting derives from the verb halt, which ultimately comes from the Old Norse word *halta meaning "to limp."
