ETYMOLOGY->
From fey + -ness.  Fey ultimately comes from the Old English *fæge (doomed, fated to die), related to Old High German feigi (timid).  The meaning shifted over time from "doomed" to "strange, otherworldly" and then to "whimsical, magical."  The suffix -ness forms nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.
