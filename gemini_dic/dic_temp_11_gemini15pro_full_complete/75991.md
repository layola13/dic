PHRASE->
(While "funniness's" is grammatically correct, it's highly unusual and awkward.  It's much more natural to rephrase these examples to avoid the possessive of "funniness.")  虽然"funniness's"在语法上是正确的，但它非常不寻常且笨拙。  为了避免 "funniness" 的所有格，重新表述这些例子会更自然。

Therefore, providing phrases using "funniness's" would be creating unnatural examples. 因此，提供使用“funniness's”的短语将是创建不自然的例子。  Better to focus on using "funniness" itself. 最好专注于使用“funniness”本身。
