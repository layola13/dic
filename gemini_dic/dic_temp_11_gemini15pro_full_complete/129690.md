non-disjunction:/ˌnɒn.dɪsˈdʒʌŋk.ʃən/ | n. | 非整倍体,不分离|The failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during cell division. | Non-disjunction during meiosis can lead to Down syndrome. 减数分裂期间的不分离会导致唐氏综合症。| Near synonyms: nondisjunction, aneuploidy | Antonyms:  normal disjunction, euploidy | noun

Etymology->
From non- + disjunction, from dis- "apart" + junction "joining," from Latin jungere "to join."  Meaning literally "not coming apart."
