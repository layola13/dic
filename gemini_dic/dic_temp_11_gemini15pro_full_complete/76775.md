gamete:/ˈɡæmiːt/ (US), /ˈɡəmiːt/ (UK)| n. | 配子 |A mature haploid male or female germ cell which is able to unite with another of the opposite sex in sexual reproduction to form a zygote. |例句：The fusion of two gametes initiates the development of a new organism. 两个配子的融合启动了一个新生物体的发育。


例句：Each gamete contributes half of the genetic material to the offspring. 每个配子贡献一半的遗传物质给后代。
