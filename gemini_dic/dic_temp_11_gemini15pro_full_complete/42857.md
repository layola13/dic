PHRASE-> (Not applicable for "courteousnesses" as it's a relatively formal and less common word.  Phrases are more commonly associated with "courtesy.")


词源:  From Middle French *courtoisness*,  from Old French *corteisie*, from *corteis* "courteous". Ultimately from Latin *cohors*, meaning "enclosure, retinue, cohort".  The meaning evolved from behavior fitting for a royal court to general politeness.
