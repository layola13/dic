diromy: /daɪˈroʊmi/ | n. | 二聚体; 双体; | A dimer is a molecule or other molecular entity composed of two identical simpler molecules, called monomers, and held together by bonds that may be either strong or weak, covalent or intermolecular. | The protein exists as a dimer in solution. 这种蛋白质在溶液中以二聚体形式存在。 | 近义词: dimer | 反义词: monomer | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From di- + -mer + -y.  "Di-" indicates two, and "-mer" refers to parts.  "-y" forms a noun.
