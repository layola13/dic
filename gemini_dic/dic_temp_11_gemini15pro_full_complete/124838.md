ETYMOLOGY->
From *muck* (manure) + *rake* (a tool for gathering). Popularized by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in a 1906 speech, where he criticized journalists who focused excessively on negative aspects of public life, comparing them to a character in John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress* who was so obsessed with raking muck that he couldn't see a celestial crown offered to him. However, the term was quickly adopted by the very journalists Roosevelt criticized and became a badge of honor.
