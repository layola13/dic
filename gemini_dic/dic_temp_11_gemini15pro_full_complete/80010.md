ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "go over," combining "go" (Old English *gan, Proto-Germanic *gananan) meaning "to move, walk" with "over" (Old English ofer, Proto-Germanic *ubar) meaning "above, across."  The combined meaning developed to signify examining something thoroughly, as if moving over every part of it.
