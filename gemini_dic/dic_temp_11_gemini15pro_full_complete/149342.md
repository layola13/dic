##pachometer:/pæˈkɒmɪtər/ | n. |厚度计，测厚仪 |  一种测量材料厚度的仪器，通常用于测量薄膜、纸张或其他类似材料的厚度。|  The technician used a pachometer to measure the thickness of the coating.(技术人员用厚度计测量涂层的厚度。) | thickness gauge, micrometer |  (无明显的反义词，可根据语境使用“thinness measuring device”等表达) | 名词meter" (from Greek μέτρον *métron* meaning "measure").  Therefore, the word literally means "thick measure" or "thickness measurer."  The "-meter" suffix is found in numerous scientific instruments designed for measuringspecific quantities.or plating) on manufactured goods to ensure quality control.method of measurement varies depending on the instrument's design, but many rely on principles of:**Ultrasonic methods:**  Sound waves are used to measure the thickness, particularly useful for measuring opaque materials.厚度计显示厚度为0.5毫米。)of instrument being used. A micrometer might measure even smaller thicknesses with higher precision than a general-purpose pachometer.  There isn't a direct antonym for "pachometer,"  as it refers to a tool—the opposite concept would be the *lack* of a tool for measuring thickness, rather thana contrasting instrument.
