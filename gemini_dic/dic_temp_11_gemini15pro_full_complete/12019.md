arthrospore:/ˈɑːrθrəˌspɔːr/ | n. |节孢子|A type of fungal spore formed by the fragmentation of hyphae.  It is a form of asexual reproduction.| The fungus reproduces by forming arthrospores.| 近义词: conidium (分生孢子), spore (孢子) | 反义词: None (Arthrospores are a specific type of spore; there isn't a direct opposite.) | 词性: noun

词源:  From Greek ἄρθρον (arthron, “joint”) + σπορά (spora, “seed, sowing”).
