注意事项:  Borane is often used as a general term for boron hydrides, although technically *borane* (BH₃) itself is a highly reactive species that readily dimerizes to diborane (B₂H₆).  Therefore, when discussing specific compounds, it's crucial to use the correct nomenclature (e.g., diborane, pentaborane, decaborane).
