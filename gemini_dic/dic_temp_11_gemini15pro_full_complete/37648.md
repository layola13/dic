ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "commute," which comes from Latin "commutare" (to change thoroughly, exchange), from "com-" (together, with) + "mutare" (to change).  The sense of travelling regularly developed from the practice of commuting a sentence or penalty (i.e., exchanging a harsher punishment for a milder one). This later extended to exchanging one type of payment for another, and finally to the regular exchange of location between home and work.
