gyroscope: /ˈdʒaɪrəˌskoʊp/ (US) /ˈdʒaɪrəskəʊp/ (UK)| n. |陀螺仪，回转仪|A device consisting of a wheel or disk mounted so that it can spin rapidly about an axis which is itself free to alter in direction. The orientation of the axis is not affected by tilting of the mounting, so gyroscopes can be used to provide stability or maintain a reference direction in navigation systems, automatic pilots, and stabilizers.|The ship's gyroscope helped it stay on course during the storm.  这艘船的陀螺仪帮助它在风暴中保持航向。|Synonyms: gyro, rotor, stabilizer|Antonyms: N/A|noun

gyroscopes: /ˈdʒaɪrəˌskoʊps/ (US) /ˈdʒaɪrəskəʊps/ (UK)| n. |陀螺仪（复数）|Plural form of gyroscope.|Modern airplanes use multiple gyroscopes for navigation and stability. 现代飞机使用多个陀螺仪进行导航和稳定。|Synonyms: gyros, rotors, stabilizers|Antonyms: N/A|noun
