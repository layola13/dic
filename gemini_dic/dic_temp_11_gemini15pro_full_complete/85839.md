hcfc:/ˈeɪtʃ siː ef siː/ | n. | 氢氯氟烃 | Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, a group of man-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon, used as refrigerants, solvents, and propellants. They are less damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs but still contribute to global warming. |  HCFCs were introduced as temporary replacements for CFCs. 氢氯氟烃被引入作为氟氯化碳的临时替代品。| synonyms: refrigerant, coolant | antonyms:  natural refrigerant (e.g., propane, ammonia) | noun
