oneth: /wʌnθ/ (This pronunciation is hypothetical as "oneth" is not a standard English word) |Not a standard English word -  potentially an invented ordinal number. | 第一个 (Hypothetical -  does not exist in standard usage)| This word is not part of standard English vocabulary.  It seems to be a creatively formed ordinal number, analogous to "first" (1st), "second" (2nd), "third" (3rd), etc.  Someone might invent it to mean "the first one" in a specific context, but it is not generally recognized or used. | There are no standard English examples, as "oneth" is not a real word. A hypothetical example within a fictional context could be: "The oneth contestant to finish the race will receive a prize."  (This is not grammatically correct in standard English). | Since "oneth" is not a real word, it has no true synonyms or antonyms.  If used to mean "first," then "first" would be a synonym. |Not a standard part of speech.
