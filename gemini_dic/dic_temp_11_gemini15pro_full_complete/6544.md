amylobacter:/əˈmaɪloʊˌbæktər/| n. |淀粉杆菌|A genus of anaerobic bacteria that produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and sometimes butanol and acetone by fermentation of carbohydrates, especially starch.  They are found in soil, sewage, and the rumen of herbivores.|Amylobacter are essential for the digestion of cellulose in ruminant animals.| 近义词: Clostridium (some species)| 反义词:  (No direct antonym for a genus of bacteria.  One could consider aerobic bacteria as a functional opposite.)| noun
