词源：From French brute "brutish, raw, rough," from Latin brutus "heavy, dull, insensible, irrational," figuratively "brutish, animal," literally "heavy, weighty," perhaps from a PIE root *gwere- "heavy."  来自法语 brute “野蛮的，生的，粗糙的”，源自拉丁语 brutus “沉重的，迟钝的，无感觉的，不合理的”，比喻义为“野蛮的，动物的”，字面意思是“沉重的，有重量的”，可能来自 PIE 词根 *gwere- “沉重的”。
