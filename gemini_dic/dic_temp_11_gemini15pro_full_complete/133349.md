nonextensivenesses:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 非广延性 | The quality or state of being nonextensive.  This refers to systems where the entropy or other thermodynamic properties do not scale linearly with the system size. |  The nonextensivenesses of the system made it difficult to model. 系统的非广延性使其难以建模。|  The observed nonextensivenesses challenged the classical thermodynamic assumptions.  观察到的非广延性挑战了经典的热力学假设。 | nonadditivity, nonscalability | extensiveness, additivity | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
nonextensivenesses:  This word is built from several components:

* "non-": a prefix meaning "not"
* "extensive": an adjective referring to properties that scale linearly with system size, derived from the Latin "extendere" meaning "to stretch out"
* "-ness": a suffix turning an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality
* "-es": a suffix indicating the plural form
