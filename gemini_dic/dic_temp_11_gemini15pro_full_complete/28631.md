词源： 
Cargason comes from the Spanish word "cargazón," which means "cargo" or "load."  It shares its roots with the more common English word "cargo," both ultimately deriving from the Latin "carricare," meaning "to load a car." While "cargo" is the preferred term in modern English, "cargason" persists, though less frequently used.
