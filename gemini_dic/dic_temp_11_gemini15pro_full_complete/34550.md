clear-headed:/ˌklɪrˈhedɪd/
词源：clear (清晰的) + headed (有...头的)
The word "clear" comes from the Old French "cler" and ultimately from the Latin "clarus," meaning "bright" or "clear."  "Headed" comes from the Old English "hēafod," meaning "head." The combination of these two words creates the meaning of having a clear head, both literally and figuratively.
