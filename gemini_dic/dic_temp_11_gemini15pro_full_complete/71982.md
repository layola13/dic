flinch's:/flɪntʃɪz/ | n. | 退缩，畏缩 |  The possessive form of "flinch," indicating that the flinch belongs to someone or something.  While grammatically correct, it's rarely used because the act of flinching is rarely possessed. It's more common to express the ownership of the flinch through other constructions, like "his flinch" or "the flinch of the horse." |  The flinch's quickness surprised me. (This example is grammatically correct, but sounds awkward and unnatural.) | 近义词: recoil, wince, shrink | 反义词:  steadfastness, resolve | 词性: noun (possessive)
