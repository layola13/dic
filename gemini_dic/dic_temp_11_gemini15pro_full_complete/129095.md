nitry:/ˈnaɪtri/| adj.|硝的，含氮的|Containing nitrogen, especially in the form of nitrates.  Relating to or containing nitrogen. Characterized by the presence or effects of nitrates or nitrogen compounds.|The air had a sharp, nitry smell.  空气中有一股刺鼻的硝酸味。|近义词：nitrogenous, nitric|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "nitrogen-free")|词性: adjective


Etymology: From *nitre* (now *niter*) + *-y*.  *Nitre* comes from Old French *nitre*, from Medieval Latin *nitrum*, from Arabic *natrūn*, from Greek *nítron*.  Ultimately from Ancient Egyptian *ntry*, meaning 'divine' or 'pure'. The suffix *-y* forms adjectives meaning "characterized by" or "full of".
