词源:

Middle English *follen*, from Old French *foler* “to press, full cloth,” from Latin *fullō* “one who fulls cloth.” The sense development is from "pressing" to "oppressing" to "cheating, deceiving."  It's related to the word "fuller," a person who cleans and thickens cloth.  The meaning "fool" is likely a shortened form of "foolish."
