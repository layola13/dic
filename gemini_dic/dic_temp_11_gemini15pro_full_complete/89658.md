Etymology->
The origin of "hooligan" is uncertain, but a popular theory connects it to the Irish surname "Houlihan," supposedly belonging to a rowdy family in London in the late 19th century.  Another theory attributes it to a character in a music hall song.  Regardless of the specific source, the term emerged in the 1890s to describe young street toughs and gangs known for violence and vandalism.
