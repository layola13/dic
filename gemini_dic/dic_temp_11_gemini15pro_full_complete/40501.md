Etymology: From Late Latin *contriviātus, past participle of contriviāre  "to rub together, grind, contrive," from Latin com- "together" + triviāre "to make a commonplace" (from trivius "crossroads," from tri- "three" + via "way"). The sense shifted from "to wear down by frequent use" to "devise, invent, plan."
