词源:

"frig" likely originates as a euphemism or minced oath for "fuck," influenced by words like "fidget" and "friggle."  Its precise etymology is uncertain.  "Frig" as a verb meaning "to rub" dates back to the 14th century, but its sexual and more general senses of "to annoy" or "to trifle with" are more recent, likely emerging in the 19th or 20th centuries.

注意事项:

frigs 是一个粗俗的词语，在正式场合应该避免使用。  它的使用取决于语境和说话对象，在某些情况下可能被认为是冒犯的。
