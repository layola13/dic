词源： "high" + "pressure". "High" meaning elevated or intense, and "pressure" referring to the exertion of force. "High-pressure" as an adjective was first recorded in the late 18th century, originally in a literal scientific context. The figurative sense of "involving intense stress or demands" emerged in the mid-20th century.
