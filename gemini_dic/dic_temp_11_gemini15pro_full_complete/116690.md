maturements: /məˈtʃʊərmənts/ | n. | 成熟，到期，发育；（票据等的）到期日 |  This word doesn't seem to be a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a rare/technical term.  It might be intended as "measurements" (测量), "maturities" (到期日，成熟期), or "maturement" (if used as a noun form of "mature," meaning the process of becoming mature). Without further context, it's difficult to give a precise definition. | *Due to the likely misspelling, providing examples, synonyms, and antonyms is not possible.* | noun
