词源:
Likely originating in the late 1950s in the United States, the word's exact etymology is uncertain.  One theory connects it to the character "Nerd" in Dr. Seuss's 1950 book *If I Ran the Zoo*. Another suggests a link to the 1940s slang term "nert," meaning "stupid or crazy person."


注意事项:  While "nerd" sometimes carries a negative connotation, it is increasingly embraced as a positive term reflecting passion and expertise.
