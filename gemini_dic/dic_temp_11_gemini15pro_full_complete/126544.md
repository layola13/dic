Etymology->
From French *nacré*, derived from *nacre* ("mother-of-pearl") + *-eux* (suffix forming adjectives). *Nacre* is from Arabic *naqqāra*  ("a kind of shellfish"), ultimately from Persian *nakar* ("kettledrum"). The iridescent quality of nacre is reminiscent of the polished surface of a kettledrum.
