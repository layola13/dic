词源:  "Checky" likely originated as a playful variation of "cheeky," which itself comes from "cheek" (Old English *cēace) referring to the fleshy part of the face below the eye.  The playful or slightly disrespectful connotations likely arose from the idea of "boldness" or "impudence" associated with sticking out one's cheek.
