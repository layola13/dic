词源:  The word "overconcerns" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and the noun "concerns" (meaning "worries" or "anxieties").  The prefix "over-" has its roots in Old English "ofer," while "concern" comes from the Old French "concerner," ultimately derived from the Latin "concernere" (to mix together, to sift).
