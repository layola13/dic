词源：
The origin of "daddle" is uncertain. It likely emerged in the 18th century, possibly as a variant of "dawdle."  It might be related to the now obsolete verb "dad" meaning "to move quickly and lightly," or it could be imitative of a gentle, rocking motion.  Its exact etymology remains somewhat obscure.
