ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *cofa (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *kufą (“rounded object, tub, bowl”), from Proto-Indo-European *gew- (“to bend, curve”). Cognate with Old Norse kofi (“hut, small chamber”), Dutch kof (“basket, tub”), German Kufe (“vat, tub”). The semantic development is likely from the idea of a curved or rounded shape, like a tub or bowl, to a curved or rounded inlet in a coastline.
