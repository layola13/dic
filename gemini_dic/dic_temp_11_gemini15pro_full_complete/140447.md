Note: "oks" is very informal and generally considered non-standard.  While it conveys the same meaning as "OK," it's best to use "OK" or "okay" in formal writing or professional settings.  There's no British English variant for "oks."  It's primarily used in casual online communication.  There's no recognized etymology beyond being a shortened, informal version of "OK."
