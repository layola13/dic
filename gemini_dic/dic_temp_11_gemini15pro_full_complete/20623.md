词源:  "Blackleg" originally referred to a disease in cattle and sheep characterized by dark patches on the legs. The term was later applied to strikebreakers, perhaps because they were seen as a disease or infection within the workforce, or because they were considered "dirty" or "tainted" for betraying their fellow workers.
