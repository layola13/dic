注意事项:  "Executiveness's" is grammatically correct but rarely used due to the awkward double possessive.  "Executiveness" is generally preferred.  While it's grammatically acceptable to use a possessive with an abstract noun like "executiveness," it can sound clunky and unnatural.  Rephrasing with "of" is often a better option (e.g., "the executiveness of the CEO").
