The word "madreperl" doesn't exist in standard English or Spanish dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a combination of words.  The closest word might be "mother-of-pearl," referring to the iridescent substance forming the inner layer of certain mollusk shells.  Therefore, I will analyze "mother-of-pearl."

mother-of-pearl: /ˌmʌðər əv ˈpɜːrl/ (British) /ˌmʌðər əv ˈpɝl/ (American)| n. |珍珠母；贝壳内层| Iridescent substance forming the lining of the shell of certain mollusks, especially oysters and abalones, used to make buttons, jewelry, etc. | The buttons on her coat were made of mother-of-pearl.| 近义词: nacre | 反义词:  (No direct antonym exists) | 词性: noun
