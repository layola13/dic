ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *kerven*, from Old English *ceorfan* ("to cut, carve"), from Proto-Germanic *kerfaną* ("to cut, notch, carve"), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰerbh-* ("to scratch, scrape").  Cognate with Dutch *kerven* ("to notch"), German *kerben* ("to notch"), Old Norse *kjarfa* ("to carve"). The past participle form *carven* is now largely archaic, with *carved* being more common.
