PHRASE->
(Due to the limited usage of "nonsolidest", common phrases are difficult to establish.  It's primarily a descriptive term used in scientific contexts.)


注意事项:  "Nonsolidest" while grammatically correct, is rarely used.  "Least solid" or "most fluid" are more common and natural-sounding alternatives.
