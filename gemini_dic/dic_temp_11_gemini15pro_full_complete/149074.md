##oxaline 的详细解析n. | 恶唑啉 |  Oxaline refers to a heterocyclicorganic compound containing a five-membered ring with two carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and two carbon atoms bonded to a nitrogen atom.  It's aderivative of oxazole, characterized by a specific arrangement of atoms.  The exact properties and reactivity depend on the substituents attached to the ring.  Oxalines are often intermediates in organic synthesis, but they can also have biological activity, depending on their structure.  They are not commonly found in nature in their pure form. | 例句：The synthesis of the oxaline derivative involved a complexseries of reactions. (恶唑啉衍生物的合成涉及一系列复杂的反应。)  Researchers are investigating the potential biological activity of certain substituted oxalines. (研究人员正在研究某些取代恶唑啉的潜在生物活性。) |近义词:  (Due to the specific chemical nature, direct synonyms are scarce.  Related terms could include specific oxaline derivatives, depending on the substituents.) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms exist.) | n."oxazole."  Oxazole itself is named based on its structure:  "oxa-" refers to the oxygen atom in the heterocyclic ring, and "-azole" is a suffix used to indicate a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom.  Therefore, "oxaline" signifies a compound thatis structurally related to oxazole, likely through modification or substitution.You would encounter this term in scientific publications, research papers, and chemical databases.isomers.
