The word "griffus" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It might be a misspelling, a technical term in a specific field, a proper noun, or even a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a technical term, knowing the field would be helpful.  If it's a misspelling, I could suggest possible correct spellings.


However, since you've requested examples of grammatical usage using "what," I can provide that information.  Please note that I will be using "what" as the example word, not "griffus."

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonyms: which, whatever | Antonyms: (not applicable for this word type) | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
