auxins:/ˈɔːksɪnz/| n. |植物生长素|A class of plant hormones that regulate growth, particularly by stimulating cell elongation.  They are involved in a wide range of plant processes, including phototropism, geotropism, apical dominance, and fruit development.|例句：Auxins promote root growth in cuttings.  植物生长素促进插枝生根。

例句：The concentration of auxins influences the plant's response. 植物生长素的浓度会影响植物的反应。|近义词：plant hormones, growth regulators|反义词: (No direct antonym, but some plant hormones have opposing effects, such as abscisic acid which inhibits growth)|词性:noun
