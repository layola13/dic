ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ċēse (attested only in compounds such as ċēselibban "rennet"), from West Germanic *kāsī (cf. West Frisian tsiis, Dutch kaas, German Käse), from Latin caseus "cheese." The plural form "cheeses" simply adds the regular English plural ending "-es" to the singular "cheese."
