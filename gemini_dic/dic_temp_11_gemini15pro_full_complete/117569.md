PHRASE->
hundreds of megahertz's 数百兆赫兹
tens of megahertz's 数十兆赫兹
a few megahertz's 几兆赫兹
operating at ... megahertz's  以...兆赫兹运行
transmitting at ... megahertz's  以...兆赫兹传输


注意事项:
"megahertz's" is grammatically correct as a plural, but "megahertz" is typically used even for plural contexts, especially in technical writing.  Using "MHz" is even more common.
