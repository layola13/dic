knolliest:/ˈnɑːliɪst/ | adj. | 多节的，疙瘩多的，最博学的 | Having the most or very prominent knols; most knowledgeable. |  The knolliest tree in the forest was home to a family of owls. 森林里疙瘩最多的树是猫头鹰的家。| Synonyms: gnarled, knotty, lumpy, bumpy, erudite, learned | Antonyms: smooth, even, unblemished, ignorant | adjective

Etymology:  From *knoll* (a small rounded hill or mound) + *-y* (forming adjectives) + *-est* (superlative suffix).  The sense of "most knowledgeable" is a more recent, playful development, likely based on the idea of "having a lot of knowledge bumps" in one's head.
