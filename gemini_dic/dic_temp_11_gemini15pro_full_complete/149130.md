/ˈɒksaɪdz/ | n. | 氧化物 |  氧化物是由氧元素与其他元素化合生成的化合物。氧元素具有很强的氧化性，容易与大多数元素发生反应，形成各种各样的氧化物。氧化物的性质多样，有些是酸性的，有些是碱性的，有些是两性的，还有些是中性的。它们的物理性质也差异很大，可以是固体、液体或气体。氧化物在自然界中广泛存在，在工业生产和科学研究中也扮演着重要的角色。| Examples:  Iron oxide ($Fe_2O_3$) is a common rust.  Water ($H_2O$) is an oxideof hydrogen. | 近义词：compound (化合物) | 反义词：无(与其性质相关，而非直接反义词)," which itself comes from the Greek word "oxys" (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed," combined with the suffix "-ide," a common suffix used to form the names of binary compounds.  The association with "sharp" or "acid" in the Greek roots reflects the historicallyobserved acidic nature of many oxides when reacted with water.. The use of "oxide" is always contextual, relating to the chemical composition of a substance.  For example,  "metal oxides" refer to compounds consisting of a metal element and oxygen. Similarly, "non-metal oxides" refer to compounds formed by a non-metal element and oxygen.  The specificproperties of an oxide depend heavily on the element bonding with oxygen; some are highly reactive while others are relatively inert.For example, sodium oxide ($Na_2O$) reacts with hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) to produce sodium chloride ($NaCl$) and water ($H_2O$). Many metal oxides are insoluble in water.  However, some form hydroxides when dissolved in water, exhibiting alkaline properties.氧化物 (Non-Metallic Oxides):** These are typically acidic oxides. They react with water to produce acids and with bases to form salts. For example, sulfur trioxide ($SO_3$) reacts with water to form sulfuric acid ($H_2SO_4$). Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) isanother example; it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid ($H_2CO_3$).reacts with acids to form salts and water, and it also reacts with bases to form aluminates.neutral oxides.
