dereference:/diːˈrɛfərəns/| vt. n.|解引用，解除引用|To access the value stored at a memory location pointed to by a pointer or reference.  It involves retrieving the data that a pointer or reference "points" to.  In some contexts, it can also mean to remove a reference to something, thus making it eligible for garbage collection (in programming).|The program crashed when it tried to dereference a null pointer.|近义词：access, retrieve|反义词:reference|v.
