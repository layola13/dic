词源：
From Italian *inamorato*, past participle of *innamorare* (“to inflame with love”), from *in-* + *amore* (“love”).

注意事项:
*inamorato* and *inamorata* are relatively formal and somewhat archaic terms, not commonly used in modern English. They often carry a connotation of romantic or passionate love.  While *inamorato* specifically refers to a male lover, and *inamorata* to a female lover, they can sometimes be used more generally to refer to a lover of either gender, especially in poetic or literary contexts.
