PHRASE->

While grammatically correct, using the possessive form with "dizziness" is unusual and generally avoided. It's more natural to phrase things differently.  Therefore, providing phrases with "dizziness's" is not applicable.  It's better to rephrase sentences to avoid this construction.  For example, instead of "the dizziness's cause," use "the cause of the dizziness."


注意事项:  The possessive form of "dizziness" is grammatically possible but rarely used in standard English. It sounds awkward and unnatural. Rephrasing is always recommended.
