注意事项:  "Japers" is primarily considered an informal and somewhat dated exclamation. It's more common in certain dialects, particularly Irish English. While it can be used as a noun meaning "nonsense," this usage is less frequent.  It's crucial to consider the context and audience when using this word, as it might not be universally understood or appreciated.
