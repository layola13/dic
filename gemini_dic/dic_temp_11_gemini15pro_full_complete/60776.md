electromagnet:/ɪˈlɛktrəʊˈmæɡnɪt/ (UK), /ɪˈlɛktroʊˈmæɡnət/ (US)| n.|电磁铁|A magnet consisting of a coil of insulated wire wrapped around a core of magnetic material, such as iron, that produces a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it.|The scrapyard used a powerful electromagnet to lift and move cars.|近义词:solenoid|反义词:permanent magnet|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From electro- + magnet.  "Electro-" comes from Greek "ēlektron" meaning "amber" (referring to static electricity). "Magnet" ultimately derives from the Greek "Magnēs lithos" meaning "Magnesian stone," referring to a magnetic mineral found in Magnesia, a region of ancient Greece.
