From "ivory tower" + "-ed". "Ivory tower" itself is a calque (loan translation) of the French "tour d'ivoire," used figuratively by the French poet and critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve in the 19th century to describe the secluded, artistic world of the poet Alfred de Vigny. The image evokes a sense of isolation, detachment, and impracticality.
