ETYMOLOGY->
The term "back burner" originates from cooking, referring to the back burners of a stove, which are typically used for simmering or keeping food warm, rather than for active cooking. This analogy was extended to other areas of life, where tasks or issues of lower priority are figuratively placed "on the back burner."
