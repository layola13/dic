cavitation:/ˌkævɪˈteɪʃən/ | n. | 空化，空穴现象 | The formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid.  It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense shockwave. | The pump suffered damage due to cavitation.  这个泵由于空化作用而受损。| synonyms: void formation, bubble formation | antonyms: solidification, compression | noun

cavitation:/ˌkævɪˈteɪʃən/ | n. | 空蚀，气蚀 | Erosion of a solid surface, notably propeller blades and pump impellers, caused by the collapsing of bubbles in a cavitating liquid. | Cavitation damage can severely reduce the lifespan of hydraulic machinery. 空蚀会严重缩短液压机械的寿命。 | synonyms: erosion, pitting, corrosion | antonyms: accretion, deposition | noun
