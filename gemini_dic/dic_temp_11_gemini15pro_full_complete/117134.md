meaners:/ˈmiːnərz/| n. |刻薄的人；吝啬鬼|People who are unkind or ungenerous. |Those meaners never share their toys! 那些小气鬼从来不分享他们的玩具！|Synonyms: bullies, Scrooges, misers |Antonyms: kind people, generous people| noun

Etymology: From "mean" (adj., unkind, ungenerous) + "-er" (suffix forming nouns denoting persons who perform an action or possess a quality).  "Mean" itself ultimately derives from Old English "gemæne" meaning "common, general, shared by all," which later developed a sense of "lowly, inferior" and then "stingy, unkind."
