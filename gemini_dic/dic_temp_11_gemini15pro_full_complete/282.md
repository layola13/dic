abegge is not a recognized word in English. It doesn't appear in standard dictionaries and likely isn't a correctly spelled word. Therefore, I cannot provide a breakdown according to your format.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a word from a very specialized field, a slang term, or a neologism (newly coined word).

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered the word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, if it's a misspelling, I could suggest the correct word and provide the analysis you requested.


If you're interested in the word "what" since it appears in your example format extensively, I can provide that analysis:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么, 多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！| Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
