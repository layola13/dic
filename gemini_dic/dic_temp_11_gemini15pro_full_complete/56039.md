词源:
The origin of "dob" is uncertain, but it's believed to be related to the Dutch word "dobber," meaning "a float" or "a buoy."  The connection may be through the idea of something being "brought to the surface" or "exposed."  Another theory suggests a link to "dab," meaning to strike lightly, perhaps in the sense of pointing a finger at someone.
