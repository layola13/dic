Etymology:
Derived from "me too," itself shortened from "me too, I've experienced that," a phrase popularized by Tarana Burke in 2006 and later widely used during the #MeToo movement on social media.  The suffix "-istic" transforms it into an adjective, indicating a characteristic or quality related to the "me too" phenomenon.
