ETYMOLOGY->
"over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi "over, above") + "restriction" (from Latin restrict-, past participle stem of restringere "draw back tightly, restrain," from re- "back" + stringere "to draw tight").  Meaning "too many restrictions" arose from the intensifying prefix "over-".
