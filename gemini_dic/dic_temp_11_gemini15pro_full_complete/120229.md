Note:  The usage examples for the verb and noun forms of "mine" and for the noun "money" follow standard verb/noun usage and can be easily constructed following the pattern above.  Since the original question focused on "miney" and its likely misspelling of "mine", I focused the usage examples on the pronoun/determiner form which is the most likely intended meaning.
