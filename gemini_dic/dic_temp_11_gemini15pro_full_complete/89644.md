近义词: truancy, absenteeism

词性: noun (plural)

词源：
The origin of "hooky" is uncertain, but it likely comes from the Dutch word "hoeken," meaning "to peddle," or "to sell goods from a cart."  This could refer to children wandering the streets instead of attending school, possibly selling small items. Another theory connects it to the hook used by truant officers to pull children back into school, although this is less likely.
