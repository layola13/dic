PHRASE->
(Drawlier is not commonly used in phrases. It's primarily an adjective describing a quality of speech or presentation.  The following are phrases related to the concept of being monotonous or tedious, rather than phrases directly using "drawlier.")

a monotonous drone: 单调的嗡嗡声
a tedious affair: 乏味的事件
to drag on: 拖延
to be bored to tears:  无聊到流泪
to be mind-numbingly dull: 极其枯燥乏味


词源:  From "drawl" + "-ier" (comparative suffix). "Drawl" comes from probably imitative of the slow, lengthened vowels.
