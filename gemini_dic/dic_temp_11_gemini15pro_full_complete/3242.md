词源:
From Middle English *afflicten, from Old French aflicter, from Latin afflictus, past participle of affligere (“to dash to the ground, overthrow, damage, weaken, subdue, harass, grieve”), from ad- (“to, at”) + fligere (“to strike, dash”).

注意事项:
"Affile" as a noun meaning "daughter" or "female descendant" is obsolete and rarely used in modern English.  The verb form "affile" is the more common usage.
