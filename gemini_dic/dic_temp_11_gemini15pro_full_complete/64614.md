eruptivity:/ɪˈrʌptɪvɪti/| n.|喷发度，爆发力|The eruptivity of the volcano was measured on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.  这座火山的喷发度是用火山爆发指数来衡量的。|例句：The high eruptivity of the volcano caused widespread destruction.  这座火山的高喷发度造成了大范围的破坏。|近义词：explosiveness, volatility|反义词：quiescence, dormancy|词性:名词
Etymology: From erupt (v.) + -ivity (suffix forming abstract nouns of quality).  Ultimately from Latin *eruptus*, past participle of erumpere "to break out, burst forth," from ex "out" + rumpere "to break."
