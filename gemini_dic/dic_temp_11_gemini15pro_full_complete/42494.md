counterimage:/ˈkaʊntərɪmɪdʒ/ | n. |反像，逆像|  A set of points that map to a given point under a function.  The counterimage of a point y under a function f is the set of all x such that f(x) = y. | The counterimage of 0 under the function f(x) = x² is {0}.  函数 f(x) = x² 中 0 的反像是 {0}。| synonyms: preimage, inverse image | antonyms: image, range | noun


counterimages:/ˈkaʊntərɪmɪdʒɪz/ | n. |反像们，逆像们|  The plural form of counterimage, referring to multiple sets of points that map to given points under a function. |  The counterimages of the positive real numbers under the function f(x) = x² are pairs of positive and negative numbers. 函数 f(x) = x² 中正实数的反像是正负数对。| synonyms: preimages, inverse images | antonyms: images, ranges | noun
