Etymology:
From Middle English *blotten*, *bloten* (“to make pale, to stain”), from Old Norse *blóta* (“to sacrifice, to stain with blood”), from Proto-Germanic *blōtaną* (“to sacrifice, to smear with blood”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰleyH-*, *bʰloyH-* (“to bleed, to bloom, to blossom”).  The sense of "to dry" arises from the action of absorbing liquid like blotting paper.
