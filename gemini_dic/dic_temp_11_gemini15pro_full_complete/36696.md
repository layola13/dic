PHRASE->
(Collingly is not generally used in set phrases.  It's more of a descriptive adverb.)  However, one could contrive examples:

1.  He collingly offered a "what's up?"  (Meaning a dismissive "what's up?")
2.  "What if," she collingly inquired, "I refuse?"


词源:  From "colling," an obsolete word meaning "cooling" or "chilling,"  + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  Ultimately from the Old English "colian."
