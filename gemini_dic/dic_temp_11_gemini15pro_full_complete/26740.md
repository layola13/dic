The word "cadmic" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a typo or a newly coined term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis for it.  If you meant a different word, please provide it and I'll be happy to help.

For example, if you meant "academic," here's the analysis:

academic: /ˌækəˈdɛmɪk/ | adj. n. | 学术的；学者的；学院的；理论的；空谈的；学究气的；大学教师；大学生；学者；学究 | relating to education and scholarship |  例句：He has a brilliant academic record. 他有着辉煌的学术记录。 | 例句：She’s always been very academic. 她一直以来学习都很好。 | 近义词：scholarly, scholastic, educational, intellectual | 反义词：practical, vocational, non-academic | 词性：adjective, noun
