ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *loppen, from Old English *loppe (“spider”), from Proto-Germanic *luppō (“spider”), likely from Proto-Indo-European *(s)leub- (“to slip, slide”).  The connection between "spider" and "lop" is thought to be related to the way spiders hang or dangle.  The meaning shifted from "spider" to "something that hangs down" and eventually to "to cut off something that hangs down."
