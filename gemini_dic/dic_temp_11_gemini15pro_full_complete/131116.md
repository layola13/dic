nonbiologically:/ˌnɒnˌbaɪəˈlɒdʒɪkli/ | adv. | 非生物地；非生物学地 |  Not relating to biology or living organisms; through non-biological means. |  The compound was synthesized nonbiologically in the lab.  这个化合物是在实验室里非生物合成的。 | Synonyms: synthetically, artificially, inorganically | Antonyms: biologically, organically | 词性: 副词

例句：
The substance was created nonbiologically.
这种物质是非生物制造的。

The process occurred nonbiologically.
这个过程是非生物发生的。


近义词: synthetically, artificially, chemically

反义词: biologically, organically, naturally

词性: 副词 (adverb)

词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "biological" + "-ly" (adverb suffix).  "Biological" comes from "bio-" (Greek "bios" meaning "life") + "-logical" (suffix relating to the study of).
