PHRASE->

(This word doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases.  Its usage is fairly literal.)


词源:  "Out-" (prefix meaning exceeding or surpassing) + "snatch" (verb meaning to seize quickly and suddenly).  Therefore, "outsnatch" means to snatch something more quickly or effectively than another.
