词源:  "Over-" (meaning "excessively") + "orchestrated" (past participle of "orchestrate," meaning "to arrange or organize something carefully"). "Orchestrate" comes from "orchestra," which ultimately derives from the Greek "orchestra," referring to the circular space in front of the stage in a Greek theatre.
