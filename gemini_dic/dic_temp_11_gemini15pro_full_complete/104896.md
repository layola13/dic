词源: From the verb "keep,"  Old English *cēpan "to seize, grasp, hold, observe," from Proto-Germanic *kōpijaną (source also of Old Frisian kepa "to buy," Old Saxon kopian "to buy, trade, converse," Middle Dutch kepen "to buy, catch," Old High German koufon "to buy," German kaufen "to buy"), from PIE root *keh₂p- "to grasp, take." The noun "keepings" arises from the gerund form of "keep," indicating the things that are kept.
