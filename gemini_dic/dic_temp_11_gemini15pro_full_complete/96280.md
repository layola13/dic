词源: "Indier" is a comparative adjective, derived from "indie," short for "independent." "Indie" originally referred to independent record labels and artists operating outside the mainstream music industry.  The suffix "-er" indicates a greater degree of the quality described by the root word.  Thus, "indier" means more independent than "indie."
