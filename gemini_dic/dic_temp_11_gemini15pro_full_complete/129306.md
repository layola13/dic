词源:  The origin of "nog" for the drink is uncertain, but it may be related to "noggin," meaning a small mug or cup.  "Noggin" itself comes from a Middle English word "nokken," meaning a wooden cup.  The use of "nog" to mean a light blow is also of uncertain origin, but it may be related to the idea of hitting someone on the head with a small cup or mug.
