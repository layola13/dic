PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically form set phrases.  It's an adverb describing *how* something is done.  Therefore, providing phrases is difficult and would likely feel forced and unnatural.)


注意事项:

This word is not particularly common and might sound a little contrived in many contexts. Using "in the Italian manner" or "Italian-style" might often be more natural choices.
