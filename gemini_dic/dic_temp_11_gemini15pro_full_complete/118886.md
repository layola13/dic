metastoma: /ˌmɛtəˈstoʊmə/| n. |口下板；后口板|A plate-like structure behind the mouth in certain extinct arthropods, especially eurypterids (sea scorpions) and xiphosurans (horseshoe crabs), thought to be homologous with the labium of insects.  |The metastoma of the eurypterid was surprisingly large.  这只广翅鲎的口下板异常大。|Synonyms: labium (in insects), hypostome|Antonyms: None (highly specialized anatomical term)|noun
