Etymology:
From comfortable + -ness.  "Comfortable" comes from Middle English *comfortable*, from Old French *confortable*, from Late Latin *confortabilis*, from Latin *confortare* "to strengthen much," from *com-* (intensive prefix) + *fortis* "strong." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
