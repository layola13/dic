ETYMOLOGY->
From feckless + -ly.  Feckless comes from Scottish and Northern English *feck, meaning "effect, value, purpose," which is related to "effect."  The suffix -less indicates a lack of something.  Therefore, "feckless" means lacking effectiveness or purpose, and "fecklessly" describes actions performed in such a manner.
