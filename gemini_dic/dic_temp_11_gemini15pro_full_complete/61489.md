ETYMOLOGY->
From Italian *imbroglio* "confusion, intricacy,"  from *imbrogliare* "to confuse, entangle," from *in- + brogliare* "to mix, stir, embroil," of uncertain origin, possibly from Vulgar Latin *brogilus* "small drinking vessel," which may be related to *broccus* "projecting, pointed," hence "a jug with a spout."
