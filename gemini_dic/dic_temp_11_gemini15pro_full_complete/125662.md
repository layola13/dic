Etymology:  From Late Middle English *mompes, plural of *momp (“grimace, mumbling”), from earlier mommen (“to mumble, to chew with closed lips, to look sullen”), of imitative origin. Related to Dutch mompen (“to mumble, to grumble”), German Mummenschanz (“mummery”).  The connection is presumably to the muffled speech and facial swelling caused by the illness.
