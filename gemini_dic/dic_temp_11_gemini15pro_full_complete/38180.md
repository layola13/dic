comptly (No other pronunciation found) | adv. | 顺从地，服从地，殷勤地 | Derived from "compt," an obsolete variant of "count," meaning "account" or "reckoning."  The suffix "-ly" transforms it into an adverb. Historically, being "compt" implied being accountable or answerable to someone, hence the sense of obedience or compliance.  While "compt" itself has fallen out of use, "comptly" persists, albeit rarely. | He comptly fulfilled all the requirements. 他顺从地完成了所有的要求。| Synonyms: obediently, submissively, dutifully, respectfully, obligingly | Antonyms: defiantly, rebelliously, disobediently, reluctantly | 词性: 副词
