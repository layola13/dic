The first kindergarten was opened in 1837 in Bad Blankenburg (in present-day Thuringia, Germany). | Fröbel believed that play is the highest expression of human development in childhood for it alone is the free expression of what is in the child’s soul.  | 近义词: educator, teacher, pedagogue | 反义词: (No direct antonym for a person.  Perhaps "opponent of early childhood education" could be considered a contextual antonym.) | 词性: 名词
