Etymology:
From inter- + circling, from circle + -ing.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among." "Circle" comes from the Old French "cercle" and ultimately from the Latin "circulus," meaning "small ring."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb "circle" into a present participle, which can function as an adjective.
