词源:  "Jeck" is a variant spelling, likely a dialectal or archaic form, of "jack," which has a complex etymology.  It ultimately derives from the Late Latin name "Jacobus," (James), which became a common name in medieval Europe.  "Jack" was then used as a generic term for a man of the common people, and from there, it was applied to various garments and tools associated with common laborers, including the "jack" or jacket.
