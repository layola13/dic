From matchless + -ness. Matchless from match + -less.  Match (n.) meaning "an equal or suitable person or thing" from Old English *mæcca (unattested) from Proto-Germanic *makō "mate, spouse," ultimately perhaps from PIE *mag- "to knead, fit together."  -less is a suffix meaning "without."  -ness is a suffix forming nouns from adjectives.
