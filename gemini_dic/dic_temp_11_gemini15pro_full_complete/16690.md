barretter:/bəˈrɛtər/ | n. | 镇流器，巴雷特稳流器 | A device used to stabilize the current in a circuit, especially in early radio receivers. It consists of a fine iron wire enclosed in a glass tube containing hydrogen.  The resistance of the wire increases with increasing current, thus limiting current fluctuations. | The old radio used a barretter to regulate the current. 这台老式收音机使用镇流器来调节电流。 | synonyms: ballast resistor, current regulator | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, perhaps a short circuit which allows uncontrolled current flow) | noun
