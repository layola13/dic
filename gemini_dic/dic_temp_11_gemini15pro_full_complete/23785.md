Etymology->
From Middle English *brauni, from Old English *brūnecg (“brown edge, blade”), equivalent to brown +‎ -y.  The original sense was "having a brown blade or cutting edge" (of a weapon), hence "sharp, strong, effective".  The current sense of "muscular" arose from the association of strength with dark complexion.
