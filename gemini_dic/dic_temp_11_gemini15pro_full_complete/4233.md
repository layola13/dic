airlock: /ˈɛərlɒk/ (UK) /ˈɛrlɑːk/ (US) | n. | 气闸 | An airtight chamber, typically in a spacecraft or submarine, with two airtight doors in series that allows passage between environments with different pressures. |  The astronaut entered the airlock before stepping out onto the lunar surface.  宇航员在踏上月球表面之前进入了气闸。

The submarine used an airlock to allow divers to enter and exit the vessel underwater.  潜水艇使用气闸让潜水员进出船只。 | 近义词: pressure chamber, decompression chamber | 反义词: (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From air + lock.  The "lock" refers to its function of sealing off and controlling passage like a lock on a canal.
