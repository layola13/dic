moldability's:/ˌmoʊldəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |可塑性，成型性|The quality of a material that allows it to be easily molded or shaped into a desired form.  This refers to the ease with which something can be shaped or formed, particularly by applying pressure.|The moldability's of the clay made it ideal for sculpting.  这种黏土的可塑性使它成为雕塑的理想材料。|Synonyms: plasticity, malleability, ductility|Antonyms: rigidity, inflexibility|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From moldable + -ity + -'s (possessive).  "Moldable" comes from the verb "mold" (to shape), which ultimately derives from the Old French word "molde" (mold, matrix).
