词源：From Spanish *carpa*, from Late Latin *carpa*, from Greek *κάρπη* (*kárpē*). Ultimately of uncertain origin.

注意事项:
This word is primarily used in Spanish-influenced contexts.  In English, the singular "carp" is generally preferred, even when referring to multiple fish.  You would typically say "many carp" or "a school of carp" rather than "carpas."
