ETYMOLOGY->
From "over-" (meaning "excessive") + "nationalize" (meaning "to bring under the control of a nation").  "Nationalize" itself comes from "nation" + "-ize" (a suffix forming verbs meaning "to make" or "to become").  The shift to "overnationalize" reflects the rise of international bodies and the concept of supranational governance.
