functor:/ˈfʌŋktər/| n. |函子|In mathematics, especially in category theory, a functor is a mapping between categories. It associates each object in the source category to an object in the target category, and each morphism in the source category to a morphism in the target category, in a way that preserves the categorical structure (i.e., composition of morphisms and identity morphisms).  In programming, particularly in functional programming, a functor is a design pattern that allows for the application of a function to a value inside a container without altering the container's structure.|Functors are essential in category theory and have applications in various fields, including computer science and logic. They provide a way to relate different mathematical structures.  In programming, functors enable a kind of generic programming, allowing one to write code that works with a variety of data structures without modification.|近义词：mapping, transformation|反义词: N/A|词性: noun
