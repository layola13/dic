Etymology:
From French antisémite, from anti- + sémite (“Semite”), ultimately from Ancient Greek Σημ (Sēm, “Shem”).  The term was coined in 1879 by French journalist Wilhelm Marr to give a pseudoscientific veneer to his anti-Jewish ideas.  While literally referring to prejudice against Semitic peoples (including Arabs and Assyrians), it is almost exclusively used to refer to prejudice against Jews.
