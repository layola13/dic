diapophysial:/ˌdaɪəpəˈfɪziəl/| adj.|横突的，肋骨突的|Relating to or associated with a diapophysis, a transverse process of a vertebra, especially in the thoracic and lumbar regions, that articulates with a rib or a rib homologue.|The diapophysial joints in the thoracic spine are important for rib movement during breathing.|近义词:transverse, costal|反义词: (No direct antonym exists, consider terms like "axial" or "central" which relate to the main body of the vertebra rather than the transverse processes)|词性:adjective
