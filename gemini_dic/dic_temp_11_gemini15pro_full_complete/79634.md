ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *glose* "explanation, comment, gloss," from Late Latin *glossa* "word needing explanation, explanation of a difficult word," from Greek *glōssa* (Attic *glōtta*) "tongue, language, obsolete or foreign word." The sense evolution is from "tongue" to "language" to "foreign word" to "explanation of a foreign word." The meaning "glossy surface" arose from the notion of a "smooth, polished" appearance.
