词源：
"Letchy" likely comes from the now obsolete verb "letch," meaning "to engage in lechery." "Letch" itself is of uncertain origin, possibly related to the Old English "liccian" (to lick) or "leccian" (to moisten), suggesting a connection to sensual pleasure.  It gained its current meaning in the 16th century.
