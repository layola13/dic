注意事项:
The word "bunghole," when referring to the anus, is highly offensive and should be avoided in all contexts except perhaps among very close friends where such language is acceptable.  Even then, caution is advised.  Its usage in any formal or professional setting is completely unacceptable.  When referring to barrels, it's a perfectly acceptable term, though less common than other synonyms.
