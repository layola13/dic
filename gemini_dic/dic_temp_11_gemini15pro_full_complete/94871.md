注意事项: "in-balance" is less common than "out of balance" or "unbalanced."  While grammatically correct in many contexts, it may sound less natural to native speakers in some cases.  Consider using alternatives like "out of balance," "unbalanced," or "lacking balance" for clearer and more idiomatic expression.
