词源:  From deprivation + -al. Deprivation comes from the Late Latin dēprīvātiōn- (stem of dēprīvātiō ), from the past participle stem of dēprīvāre "to dispossess, bereave," from de- "from, away" + prīvāre "to deprive, bereave," from prīvus "private, one's own."  Therefore, the suffix -al forms adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."
