nonplane:/ˈnɒnpleɪn/| adj.|非平面的|Not lying or able to be contained within a single plane; three-dimensional.|This sculpture is a nonplane object, extending outwards in all directions.|近义词：three-dimensional, multidimensional|反义词:planar, two-dimensional|词性:形容词
Etymology:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "plane" (from Latin "planus," meaning "flat, level").  The term arises in mathematics and geometry to describe objects that are not confined to a single plane.
