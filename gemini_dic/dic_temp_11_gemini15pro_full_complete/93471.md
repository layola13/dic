词源:  illusorinesses comes from illusory, which in turn derives from the Latin word illudere, meaning "to mock" or "to play with." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "illusory" into the noun "illusoriness," indicating the state or quality of being illusory.  The plural form "illusorinesses" refers to multiple instances or types of this quality.
