fertilizability's:/ˌfɜːrtɪlaɪzəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |受精能力，可施肥性| The fertilizability's of the soil is crucial for a good harvest. 土壤的肥力对获得好收成至关重要。|  The egg's fertilizability's decreases with age. 卵子的受精能力随着年龄的增长而降低。 |fertility, fecundity | sterility, barrenness | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From fertilizable + -ity + -'s.  "fertilizable" comes from "fertilize" which stems from the Late Latin "fertilis" meaning "fruitful, fertile," ultimately from "ferre" meaning "to bear, carry."  "-ity" is a suffix forming nouns of quality or condition. "-'s" is the possessive suffix.
