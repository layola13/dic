Etymology: From Ancient Greek βροντή (brontḗ, “thunder”) + σαῦρος (saûros, “lizard”).  The name "Brontosaurus" means "thunder lizard."  It was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879.  Later, scientists determined it was the same genus as Apatosaurus, and the name Apatosaurus, being older, took precedence.  However, in 2015, a study suggested that Brontosaurus might be a distinct genus after all, leading to its reinstatement.
