endoplasmic:/ˌɛndəʊˈplæzmɪk/ | adj. | 内质的，内质网的 | Relating to or characteristic of endoplasm, the inner portion of the cytoplasm of a cell. | The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. 内质网是真核细胞细胞质内膜小管的网络。| The scientist studied the endoplasmic functions of the cell.  科学家研究了细胞的内质网功能。 | 近义词: intracellular | 反义词: extracellular | 词性: adjective

endoplastica:  (This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a mispelling or a neologism based on "endoplasmic.")  If intended as a noun, it might refer to the endoplasmic reticulum itself, but this usage is not established.  Therefore, the following is a hypothetical analysis based on its likely intended meaning:

/ˌɛndəʊˈplæzmɪkə/ | n. | (hypothetical) 内质网 |  The endoplasmic reticulum, a network of membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. |  The endoplastica is responsible for protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. (hypothetical usage) 内质网负责蛋白质合成和脂质代谢。| Scientists are still unraveling the complexities of the endoplastica. (hypothetical usage) 科学家们仍在探索内质网的复杂性。| 近义词: endoplasmic reticulum (ER) | 反义词:  N/A | 词性: noun (hypothetical)
