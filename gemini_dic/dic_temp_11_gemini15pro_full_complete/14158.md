词源： Authorling is a combination of "author" and the suffix "-ling."  "Author" comes from the Old French "auctor" and ultimately the Latin "auctor," meaning "originator, creator, founder." The suffix "-ling" forms diminutive nouns or nouns denoting offspring or someone associated with a particular activity or attribute.

注意事项： While "authorling" is grammatically correct, it is not a commonly used word.  "Author" is the standard and preferred term.  "Authorling" might be used in a more playful or informal context to refer to a new or less experienced author.
