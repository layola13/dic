词源:  "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") + "code" (referring to computer programming instructions).  "Mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrong," "bad," or "amiss." "Code" comes from Latin "codex," meaning "tree trunk," later used for "book" and eventually, in the 20th century, for "computer instructions."
