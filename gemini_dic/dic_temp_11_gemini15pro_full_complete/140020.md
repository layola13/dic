The word "oeiliad" doesn't appear to be a valid English word.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a very obscure or archaic term. Did you perhaps mean "oeiad"?  If so, that's also not a recognized word.  The closest possibilities are "Iliad" or "Dryad", which I'll analyze below.  If you meant a different word, please provide it.

**Assuming you meant "Iliad":**

n. | 伊利亚特 | An epic poem attributed to Homer, telling the story of the Trojan War. |  He read the Iliad in its original Greek. 他用原文希腊语阅读了《伊利亚特》。 | epic, saga |  None | Noun

**Assuming you meant "Dryad":**

Dryad: /ˈdraɪæd/
n. | 树精; 树神 |  A mythical nymph inhabiting a tree or wood. |  Legend speaks of dryads protecting the ancient forests. 传说树精守护着古老的森林。 | wood nymph, tree spirit | None | Noun
