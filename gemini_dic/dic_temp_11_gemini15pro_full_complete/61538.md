embryoniform:/ˈɛmbriəˌnɪfɔːrm/| adj.|胚胎状的，胚胎形的|Resembling or having the form of an embryo. |The embryoniform structure was identified under the microscope. 在显微镜下识别出了胚胎状的结构。|The newly discovered fossil exhibited an embryoniform shape. 新发现的化石呈现出胚胎状。|近义词：embryonic, rudimentary|反义词:developed, mature|词性:形容词
Etymology: From embryo + -form.  "Embryo" comes from the Greek "ἔμβρυον" (embruon), meaning "something that grows within," from "ἐν" (en), meaning "in," and "βρύειν" (bryein), meaning "to swell, be full." "-form" comes from the Latin "forma," meaning "shape, form, figure."
