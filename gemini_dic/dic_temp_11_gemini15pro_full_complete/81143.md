PHRASE->

(While "granado" is primarily used as an adjective relating to pomegranates, creating natural phrases is difficult.  Therefore, I offer phrases demonstrating *how* it *could* be used, acknowledging these are not standard English phrases.)

a granado hue - 石榴色
granado blossoms - 石榴花
granado seeds - 石榴籽
granado juice - 石榴汁

注意事项:

This word is relatively uncommon in modern English.  "Pomegranate" is more frequently used.  Therefore, many native speakers may not be familiar with "granado."
