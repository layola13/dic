Avoid contact with = 避免接触
Avoid unnecessary risks = 避免不必要的风险
Avoid making eye contact = 避免眼神接触

注意事项:
The word "evitate" is relatively uncommon compared to its synonym "avoid." While grammatically correct, using "avoid" is generally preferred in modern English due to its wider usage and clearer understanding.
