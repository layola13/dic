词源:  The term "jack-in-the-box" likely originates from the medieval practice of placing a small figure inside a box that would spring out when opened, sometimes called a "Jack out of the box."  "Jack" was a common name for a peasant or common man, used generically for various figures.  Over time, the name evolved into "jack-in-the-box."
