词源: Italian, superlative of *forte* "loud."
用法说明: Fortissimos is the plural of *fortissimo*,  an Italian musical term indicating the highest degree of loudness. It's used as an adjective to describe musical passages or notes played at this dynamic level.  While *fortissimo* itself can function adverbially, *fortissimos* is primarily adjectival.  It's less common than *fortissimo* and usually refers to multiple instances of extreme loudness within a piece.
