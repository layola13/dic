monad:/ˈmɒnæd/ (UK) /ˈmoʊnæd/ (US)| n.|单子，单体， монада (Russian)|In programming, a monad is a design pattern that allows structuring programs generically while also allowing them to deal with side effects such as I/O in a functional manner.  In philosophy, a monad is an ultimate unit of being. |Example 1:  Haskell uses monads extensively for handling side effects.  (Haskell广泛使用单子来处理副作用。)
Example 2:  In Leibniz's philosophy, monads are simple, indivisible, and immaterial substances. (在莱布尼茨的哲学中，单子是简单的、不可分割的、非物质的实体。)|近义词:unit, entity (in philosophy); wrapper, container (in programming)|反义词:dyad, plurality (in philosophy)|词性:noun
