注意事项:
Although grammatically correct, using "chlorines" in the plural is unusual.  In most cases, simply "chlorine" is sufficient, even when referring to different types. This is because chlorine is often treated as a mass noun.  Using the plural might imply different isotopes or specific chlorine-containing compounds in a technical context.
