词源:  "lippiness" is derived from "lippy" (meaning having prominent or full lips) + "-ness" (a suffix forming nouns expressing a state, condition, or quality).  While "lippy" itself doesn't directly relate to dryness, "lippiness" has taken on the specific meaning of chapped lips.  This is likely a relatively recent semantic shift.  There's no established etymology for this specific meaning in major dictionaries, suggesting it's a colloquial or less common usage that evolved from the association of lips with a particular condition.  The plural form "lippinesses" is even less common and might be considered non-standard.  It might be used to refer to multiple instances or occurrences of chapped lips, perhaps on different individuals or at different times.
