ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *mercuriālis, from Latin Mercurius (Mercury, the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, messages/communication, travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves; also, the planet Mercury).  The association with the element mercury likely comes from the perceived "quicksilver" nature of both the god and the substance.
