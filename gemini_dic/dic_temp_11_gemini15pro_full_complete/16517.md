PHRASE->
(Barium doesn't typically form common phrases in everyday language. It is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.  Therefore, providing general "what" phrases is not relevant.)


词源: From French *baryte*, from Greek *barys* "heavy".

注意事项:
The word "bariums" is rarely used.  "Barium" itself is typically used even when referring to multiple instances or forms of the element.  For example, "different barium compounds" is preferred over "different bariums compounds".
