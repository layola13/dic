注意事项：

*  "Nongay" is not a widely accepted or commonly used term. It can sometimes be perceived as awkward or even slightly offensive. Using "straight" or "heterosexual" is generally preferred.
* While grammatically correct in the examples provided, the repeated use of "nongays" can feel unnatural and forced. In real-world conversations and writing, it's important to use language that is inclusive and respectful.  Consider focusing on actions and allyship rather than labeling individuals based on their sexual orientation.
