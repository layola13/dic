##para-dichlorobenzene: 详细解析daɪklɔːroʊbenziːn/ | n. |对二氯苯 |  对二氯苯 (p-dichlorobenzene) 是一种有机化合物，化学式为C₆H₄Cl₂。它是一种无色晶体，具有强烈的樟脑气味。它主要用作杀虫剂、驱虫剂和除臭剂。对二氯苯存在两种异构体：邻二氯苯和对二氯苯。对二氯苯的毒性相对较低，但仍应避免直接接触和吸入。dichlorobenzene is an organic compound with the chemical formula C₆H₄Cl₂.  The "para-" prefix indicates that the two chlorine atoms are positioned opposite each other on the benzene ring. It's a colorless crystalline solid witha strong, characteristic mothball-like odor.  This odor is often described as pungent and somewhat sweet. Its primary uses stem from its fumigant and insecticide properties.  It's commonly utilized in mothballs, toilet bowl disinfectants, and other household products where its ability to repel insects and eliminate odors is beneficial. While relatively low in toxicity compared to some other pesticides, it's still considered harmful if ingested or inhaled in large quantities. Long-term exposure can lead to health problems.  It's important to follow safety precautions when using products containing para-dichlorobenzene.hlorobenzene is effective in repelling moths from clothing.  对二氯苯能有效驱除衣物上的飞蛾。as it describes a specific chemical compound.  However, we can consider alternatives that serve the opposite function:." In chemistry, it denotes a specific spatial arrangement of substituents on a benzene ring (1,4-substitution).was originally isolated. The suffix "-ene" indicates an unsaturated hydrocarbon., as well as in more general discussions of household products.  The word is understood within the context of its chemical properties and applications.  It's also important to note the potential dangers associated with incorrect handling and inhalation.  Therefore, safe usage should always be prioritized.
