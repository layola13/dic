g-force:/ˈdʒiː fɔːrs/| n. |重力; G力|A force of acceleration, especially due to gravity or centrifugal force, informally measured as a multiple of the standard acceleration of gravity on Earth's surface.|The pilot experienced a g-force of 5 during the sharp turn. 飞行员在急转弯时承受了5个G的重力。|近义词：gravitational force, acceleration force|反义词: None|noun
