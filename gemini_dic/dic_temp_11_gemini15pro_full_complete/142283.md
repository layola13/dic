The word "orsedue" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a very specialized term, or a word from a different language.  If you could provide more context, like where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests a demonstration of the format with grammatical explanations and examples, I will use the word "what" as a demonstration.
