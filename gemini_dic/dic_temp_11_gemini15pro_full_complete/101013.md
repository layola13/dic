PHRASE->
N/A (Invariability is a noun and doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way verbs or adjectives do.  It's more common to see phrases using "invariable" or "invariably".)


词源:
From Late Latin *invariabilis, from in- ‘not’ + variabilis (see variable).

注意事项:
While "invariably" often means "always," it can also suggest a strong tendency or a very high frequency, even if not literally every single instance.
