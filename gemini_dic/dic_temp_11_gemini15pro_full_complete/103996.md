juglandine:/ˌdʒʌɡˈlænˌdiːn/| n.|胡桃醌，核桃醌|A toxic substance present in the leaves, roots, and green husks of the black walnut tree (Juglans nigra). It inhibits the growth of other plants in a phenomenon known as allelopathy.|The juglandine from the walnut tree inhibited the growth of the tomatoes planted nearby.|近义词：5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (chemical name)|反义词: None|词性:noun

Etymology: From Juglans (the walnut genus name) + -ine (a suffix indicating a chemical substance). Juglans is from Latin jūglans "walnut," from jūglāns (genitive jūglandis) "walnut tree," contraction of Jōvis glāns "Jupiter's acorn," from Jōvis, genitive of Jūpiter "Jupiter" + glāns "acorn."
