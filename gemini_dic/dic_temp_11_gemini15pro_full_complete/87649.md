hexacid:/ˈhɛksæsɪd/
|adj.|六酸的|An acid having six acidic hydrogen atoms per molecule.  A hexacid can donate six protons or hydrogen ions per molecule in an acid-base reaction.|Phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is a tetraprotic acid.  There are fewer examples of hexaprotic acids, but mellitic acid is one.|近义词:polyprotic acid|反义词:monoprotic acid|词性:adjective
