词源：  "Kaligenous" likely comes from the Greek "kalos" (beautiful) and "-genous" (producing or generating).  While not a standard English word, its construction suggests a meaning of "producing beauty" or "inherently beautiful".  It's possible this word was coined relatively recently, or has a very niche usage.
