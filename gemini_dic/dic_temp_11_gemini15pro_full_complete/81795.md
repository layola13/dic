ETYMOLOGY->

From French *grenadier*, from *grenade* (grenade), ultimately from Latin *granatum* (pomegranate).  The soldiers were originally called grenadiers because they threw grenades, which resembled pomegranates.  The association with tall stature came later, as taller soldiers were often chosen for this role.
