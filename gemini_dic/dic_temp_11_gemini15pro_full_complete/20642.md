blackman:/ˈblækˌmæn/ | n. | 黑人男子 | A man of Black African ancestry. This term is now largely considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its historical association with racial discrimination and the objectification of Black people.

(This is not a recommended usage example, but rather an illustration of where the term might be found.) | 近义词:  African American man, Black man (preferred) | 反义词: N/A (No direct antonym exists for a person's racial identity) | 词性: noun
