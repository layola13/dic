词性: noun


Etymology:
From "chapel" + "-ing" (suffix forming nouns from verbs). "Chapel" originates from Old French "chapele" (short cloak, shrine containing relics), from Medieval Latin "cappella" (shrine, chapel), diminutive of Late Latin "cappa" (cloak).  The sense evolution is related to the cloak of St. Martin, a relic kept in a small sanctuary, which then became known as a "chapel".
