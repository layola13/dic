Oviparousness is a reproductive strategy employed by a vast array of animal species, from insects and reptiles tobirds and some mammals.  This process involves the fertilization of eggs internally or externally, followed by the deposition of the eggs in a suitable environment for incubation.The developing embryo is nourished by the yolk within the egg, and the eggshell provides protection. |  Many reptiles exhibit oviparousness, laying their eggs in nests or burying them in the ground.
