词源: From Scottish *gramarye* "magic, enchantment," alteration of Middle English *gramarie*, from Old French *gramaire* "grammar, learning," ultimately from Greek *gramma* "letter of the alphabet, piece of writing." The shift in meaning perhaps arose from the association of learning with magic and occult practices. The spelling with -our is a later Frenchified respelling.
