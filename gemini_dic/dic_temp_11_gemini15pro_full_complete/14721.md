awarest:/əˈwɛərst/ | adj. |  最知道的，最意识到的 (non-standard, rare) | Most aware; having the greatest awareness.  This word is not commonly used and might be considered incorrect.  It's likely formed by adding the "-est" suffix to "aware" similar to how superlatives are formed, but "aware" doesn't usually take a superlative form.  "Most aware" is the standard way to express this. |  He was the awarest of the group about the dangers. (Non-standard usage) 他是小组中最了解危险的人。 | Near Synonyms: most aware, most conscious, most cognizant, most mindful | Antonyms: least aware, oblivious, unaware, unconscious, ignorant | Adjective
