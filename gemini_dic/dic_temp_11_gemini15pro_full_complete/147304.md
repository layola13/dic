overmodulation:/ˌoʊvərˌmɒdʒəˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 过调制 |The condition in which the modulating signal exceeds the limits of the system, resulting in distortion. | The audio signal suffered from overmodulation, causing a harsh, clipped sound. 音频信号有过调制，导致声音刺耳和削波。| Overmodulation can cause splatter on adjacent frequencies. 过调制会导致在相邻频率上出现飞溅。 | 近义词: distortion, clipping | 反义词: undermodulation | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + modulation.  "Over-" signifies "excessive" or "beyond the normal limits." "Modulation" comes from the Latin "modulatio," meaning "a measuring or regulating." Ultimately derived from "modus," meaning "measure" or "manner."
