词源: From Old French *oriental and directly from Medieval Latin orientalis "eastern," from Latin oriens "east, rising sun," present participle of oriri "to rise."  Originally referring to the countries east of the Mediterranean.

注意事项:  The term "oriental" can be considered outdated and offensive, particularly when used to refer to people.  It carries colonial connotations and perpetuates stereotypes.  "Asian" or "East Asian" are generally preferred terms when referring to people or their cultures.
