Etymology:  The word "buncombe" originates from Buncombe County, North Carolina, USA.  In 1820, during a protracted debate in the US House of Representatives, Congressman Felix Walker, representing Buncombe County, insisted on making a long and irrelevant speech despite calls to end the discussion. He explained that he was "speaking for Buncombe" – meaning he was speaking to impress his constituents back home, regardless of the relevance to the debate at hand.  The term then evolved into "buncombe" and later shortened to "bunk."
