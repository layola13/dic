farad:/ˈfæræd/ | n. | 法拉 | The standard unit of capacitance. A capacitor has a capacitance of one farad when a charge of one coulomb raises its potential by one volt. |  A one-farad capacitor can store one coulomb of charge at one volt. 一个一法拉的电容器可以在一伏特电压下存储一库仑的电荷。

The farad is a very large unit, and most capacitors are measured in microfarads or picofarads.  法拉是一个非常大的单位，大多数电容器以微法拉或皮法拉来测量。 |  近义词: None (unit of measurement) | 反义词: None (unit of measurement) | 词性: noun
