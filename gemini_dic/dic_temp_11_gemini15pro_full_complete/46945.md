ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *darne*, from Old English *dearnung* (“darning, hiding”), verbal noun from *dearnian* (“to hide, conceal”), from Proto-Germanic *darnjaną* (“to hide, conceal”). Cognate with Old Norse *dyrma* (“to hide, conceal”), Old High German *tarnēn* (“to hide, conceal”), German *tarnen* (“to camouflage”). The sense shifted from "hiding" to "mending" probably because the process of darning makes the hole disappear.
