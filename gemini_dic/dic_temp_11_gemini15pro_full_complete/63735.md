epiboly:/ɪˈpɪbəli/ | n. | 包被，外包 | The spreading or turning of a sheet of cells, typically during gastrulation, to enclose other cells.  The outer layer of cells spreads to envelop a yolk mass or deeper layer of cells. | During gastrulation, epiboly of the ectoderm encloses the mesoderm and endoderm.  原肠胚形成过程中，外胚层的包被作用包围了中胚层和内胚层。|近义词:envelopment, overgrowth |反义词:emboly |词性:名词
