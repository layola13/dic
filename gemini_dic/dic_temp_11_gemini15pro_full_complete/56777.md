dopiest:/ˈdoʊpiɪst/| adj.|最愚蠢的，最迟钝的|Most stupid or slow-witted; extremely silly.|例句：That was the dopiest movie I've ever seen. 那是我看过的最愚蠢的电影。|近义词：stupidest, silliest, dumbest, most foolish|反义词：smartest, brightest, most intelligent|词性:形容词
Etymology:  From "dope" (meaning a drug that affects the mind) + "-y" (forming an adjective meaning "affected by or characterized by") + "-est" (superlative suffix). Originally referred to someone under the influence of drugs, hence slow and stupid. Over time, the drug connection weakened, and it became a general term for "extremely silly or stupid."
