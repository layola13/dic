词源:  "Hard core" originally referred to a very durable type of concrete or stone used in construction. By the mid-20th century, the figurative meaning of "unyielding" or "inflexible" emerged, first used to describe dedicated political activists.  Later, it broadened to encompass other areas of intense commitment, like music, gaming, and unfortunately, pornography.
