The word "ferde" doesn't exist in standard English.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from a different language or dialect.  If you could provide more context, like the sentence you saw it in or the language it might be from, I can help you analyze it.

Since I can't analyze "ferde," I'll use the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.

例句：What is your name? 你叫什么名字？
