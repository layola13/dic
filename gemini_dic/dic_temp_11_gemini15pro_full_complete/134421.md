nonionizing:/ˌnɒnˈaɪənaɪzɪŋ/ | adj. | 非电离的 | Not capable of causing ionization; lacking sufficient energy to dislodge electrons from atoms or molecules. |  Visible light is a form of nonionizing radiation. 可见光是一种非电离辐射。 |  non-ionising (British spelling) | ionizing | adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + ionizing.  Ionizing comes from ion + -izing.  Ion from Greek *ion*, "going," present participle of *ienai*, "to go."  The term was coined by Michael Faraday to refer to the substance that "goes" between electrodes during electrolysis.
