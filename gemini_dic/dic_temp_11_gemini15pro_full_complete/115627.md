ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "marche" (noun) and "marchier" (verb), both derived from the Frankish "*marka" meaning "frontier, border," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*markō" meaning "boundary, borderland." The meaning shifted from "border area" to "marching to the border" and then to "marching" in general.
