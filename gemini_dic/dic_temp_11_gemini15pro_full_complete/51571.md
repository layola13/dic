deuterozooid:/ˌdjuːtərəˈzoʊɔɪd/ | n. |次生体，后生体|A zooid of the second or later generation produced by budding or fission, as in certain tunicates and corals.  A secondary zooid derived from an oozooid. |Example 1: The colony of tunicates consisted primarily of deuterozooids, responsible for feeding and respiration.  群落主要由负责摄食和呼吸的次生体组成。

Example 2:  The coral's complex structure was built by generations of deuterozooids. 珊瑚的复杂结构是由几代次生体建立起来的。|Synonym: secondary zooid|Antonym: oozooid (sometimes considered)|noun
