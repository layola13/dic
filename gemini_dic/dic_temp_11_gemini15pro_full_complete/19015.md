Etymology:
From be- + stud.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "all over," "thoroughly," or "to make." "Stud" originally referred to a post or nail, hence the meaning "to cover with studs."  Over time, the meaning evolved figuratively to "cover thoroughly" with something, whether physical objects or abstract concepts like attention or remarks.
