注意事项:

The term "kirdi" can be considered pejorative by some, so it's important to use it with sensitivity and awareness of its historical context.  More neutral terms like "non-Muslim peoples of northern Nigeria" might be preferred in some situations.  This entry focuses on the historical and anthropological usage of the term.
