USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The anemometer measures wind speed. = 风速计测量风速。
The anemograph records wind speed over time. = 风速仪记录一段时间内的风速。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The anemometer is spinning rapidly, indicating strong winds. = 风速计正在快速旋转，表明风力很大。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The anemometer has registered a gust of 50 mph. = 风速计已记录到50英里/小时的阵风。
Researchers have discovered new ways to harness anemic energy. = 研究人员发现了利用风能的新方法。(Note: "anemic" means lacking in vigor, not directly related to wind.  This sentence is modified to reflect a relevant usage.)

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The anemometer has been spinning all day, showing consistent winds. = 风速计一整天都在旋转，表明风力持续。
Meteorologists have been tracking the anemographic data for the past week. = 气象学家过去一周一直在跟踪风速数据。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The anemometer measured a peak wind speed of 60 mph during the storm. = 风暴期间，风速计测得的峰值风速为 60 英里/小时。
Ancient sailors used anemoscopes to determine wind direction. = 古代水手使用风向仪来确定风向。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The anemometer was spinning wildly while the hurricane raged. = 飓风肆虐时，风速计疯狂地旋转。
Scientists were studying the effects of anemotaxis on insect flight. = 科学家们正在研究风向性对昆虫飞行产生的影响。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The anemometer had already registered high wind speeds before the storm hit. = 在暴风雨来临之前，风速计已经记录到了高风速。
Researchers had studied anemochory long before its significance was fully understood. = 在充分了解其重要性之前，研究人员就已经对风力传播进行了研究。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The anemometer had been malfunctioning for days before it finally broke. = 风速计在最终损坏之前已经发生故障好几天了。
Meteorologists had been collecting anemographic data for months before they published their findings. = 气象学家在发表他们的发现之前已经收集了几个月的风速数据。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The new anemometer will measure wind speed more accurately. = 新的风速计将更准确地测量风速。
Engineers will design more efficient wind turbines based on anemological data. = 工程师将根据风力数据设计更高效的风力涡轮机。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The anemometer will be recording wind data throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，风速计将记录风力数据。
Scientists will be studying the impact of anemochory on different ecosystems. = 科学家们将研究风力传播对不同生态系统的影响。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the year, the anemometer will have collected a vast amount of data. = 到今年年底，风速计将收集到大量数据。
Researchers will have developed new models for predicting wind patterns. = 研究人员将开发新的模型来预测风力模式。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next month, the anemometer will have been operating continuously for a year. = 到下个月，风速计将连续运行一年。
Scientists will have been studying the effects of wind erosion for decades. = 科学家们将研究风蚀的影响数十年。


PHRASE->
N/A  (Anem- is a prefix, not a standalone word, so it doesn't form phrases in the same way as independent words. It combines with other words to form compound words.)


注意事项:
"anem" itself doesn't have a direct antonym as it's a prefix.  The antonyms provided are related to the general concept of wind or air movement.  There's no single perfect antonym for "wind" or "breath" in all contexts.
