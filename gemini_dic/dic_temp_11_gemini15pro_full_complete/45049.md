注意事项:

This word "cubbridge" is rare and possibly dialectal or archaic.  Its usage is limited compared to more common synonyms like "footbridge," "small bridge," or "culvert."  It might be understood, but using a more common synonym is usually recommended for clarity.  Its etymology is unclear, potentially a regional variation or combination of "cub" (suggesting smallness) and "bridge."
