词源:  "fixed up" is a phrasal verb formed from the verb "fix" and the adverb "up".  "Fix" comes from the Old French "fixer", ultimately from the Latin "fixus", past participle of "figere" meaning "to fix, fasten". "Up" intensifies the meaning of "fix" in this context, implying completion or thoroughness.
