Etymology:
Originating in the American South in the 19th century, "ornery" is thought to be a contraction of "ordinary," but with a shift in meaning towards "low or common," which then evolved to describe a disagreeable disposition.  It possibly blended with "onery," a variant of "honorary," used sarcastically to describe someone who acted self-important despite lacking any real distinction.
