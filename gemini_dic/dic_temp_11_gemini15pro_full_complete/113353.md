注意事项:  "luy" primarily exists in Tagalog and other Philippine languages. While it *can* be understood by English speakers familiar with these languages, it is not an English word.  Therefore, most of the example sentences are in Tagalog with English translations provided. This provides more accurate usage examples in the context where the word actually exists.
