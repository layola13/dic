brontolite:/ˈbrɒntəˌlaɪt/ | n. | 雷电化石; 闪电熔岩 |Fossilized fulgurite, a glassy tube formed in sand or rock by lightning.  It's formed when lightning strikes sandy soil or rock, fusing the materials into a glassy tube. | Example: The museum displayed a rare example of brontolite found in the Sahara Desert.  博物馆展出了一块在撒哈拉沙漠中发现的珍稀雷电化石。

Example:  Researchers analyzed the chemical composition of the brontolite to understand the intensity of the lightning strike. 研究人员分析了雷电化石的化学成分，以了解雷击的强度。 | Synonym: fulgurite | Antonym: N/A | Noun
