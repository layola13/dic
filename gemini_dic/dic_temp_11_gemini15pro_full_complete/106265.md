knowledges:/ˈnɒlɪdʒɪz/
n.
知识(复数，非常见)
The sum of what is known : the body of truth, information, and principles acquired by humankind.
例句：His knowledges of history are extensive. 他有着丰富的历史知识。(尽管语法上正确，但更常见的用法是knowledge，用单数形式表示所有知识的总和)

英文解析：While grammatically correct, "knowledges" is rarely used. "Knowledge" is typically uncountable and encompasses all that is known.  Using the plural form implies distinct bodies of knowledge, which is unusual.

例句：He sought knowledges in various fields. 他在各个领域寻求知识。(不常用，更自然的说法是 He sought knowledge in various fields.)

近义词：information, understanding, expertise, wisdom, lore
反义词：ignorance, unawareness, naiveté
词性：noun (plural, uncommon)
