词源:
"over-" (prefix) + "defiantly" (adverb)
"over-"  from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, across, beyond."  It intensifies the meaning of the word it is attached to, often implying excess.
"defiantly" from "defy" (verb) + "-ant" (suffix forming adjectives) + "-ly" (suffix forming adverbs)
"defy" from Old French "defier," ultimately from Latin "disfidare" meaning "renounce one's faith," from "dis-" (apart, away) + "fidus" (faithful).
