词源: From Old French *fourre, from Frankish *fōdr, from Proto-Germanic *fōdrą (“lining, sheath, case”). Cognate with Old English fōdor (“fodder, food”), Old High German fuotar, fōtar (“fodder”), German Futter (“lining, feed”).  Meaning shifted from "lining, sheath" to "animal pelt used as lining or garment" to just "pelt, fur".  The secondary sense of "commotion, excitement" is likely a figurative usage, possibly influenced by words like "flurry".
