lidar:/ˈlaɪdɑːr/ (US), /ˈlaɪdɑː/ (UK)| n.|激光雷达|A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.  It is a surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor.|The researchers used lidar to create a 3D map of the forest floor.|近义词:laser scanning, laser ranging|反义词:None|名词
