exchangeability:/ɪksˌtʃeɪndʒəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可交换性，可互换性 | The property of being able to be exchanged or interchanged without affecting the outcome or overall system. | The exchangeability of these parts makes repairs much easier.  这些零件的可互换性使维修更加容易。 |  interchangeability, substitutability | uniqueness, singularity | noun

exchangeability:/ɪksˌtʃeɪndʒəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可交换性，可互换性 |  In statistics, exchangeability is a property of a sequence of random variables where the joint probability distribution remains the same under any permutation of the indices. This concept is crucial in Bayesian statistics. |  The assumption of exchangeability is common in statistical modeling.  可交换性假设在统计建模中很常见。|  interchangeability, substitutability | uniqueness, singularity | noun
