From Italian *carbonaro* "charcoal burner," from Late Latin *carbonarius*, from Latin *carbo, carbonis* "coal, charcoal." The political sense refers to the members of a secret revolutionary society active in Italy in the early 19th century, so called because they supposedly met in the woods and used charcoal burners' huts as meeting places.
