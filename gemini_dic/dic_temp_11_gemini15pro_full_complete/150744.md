##paracone 的详细解析| n. | 副锥体；锥形体 |  A paracone is a cusp (a pointed projection) on the upper molars of some mammals, particularly carnivores. It's one of the features used in dental morphologyto identify and classify species.  Paracones are located on the buccal (cheek) side of the tooth. |  The study focused on the sizeand shape of paracones in different species of foxes.  这项研究集中于不同狐类物种的副锥体的尺寸和形状。| 近义词：protocone (相对的齿尖) | 反义词：无直接反义词，但可以根据语境考虑与其他齿尖的对比 |  名词" or "near") and "cone" (referring to its conical shape).  Therefore, it literally translates to  "beside the cone," referring to its position relative to other cusps on the molar tooth.  The term was developed within the field of paleontology and comparative anatomy, as researchers needed preciseterminology to describe the complex structure of mammalian teeth.  The use of Greek roots reflects the scientific naming conventions used in biology and related fields.technical term used by researchers, students, and experts studying mammalian dentition, and in describing fossil finds and the evolutionary history of mammals. The term's context is always related to the specific morphology of molar teeth.  It is not a term used in common everyday conversation.The presence of a well-defined paracone is a key characteristic distinguishing this species from its close relatives.  明确的副锥体的存在是区分该物种与其近亲的关键特征。损图案的分析为了解动物的饮食提供了线索。的比较：**of the molar tooth, opposite the paracone.  The relationship between the paracone and protocone is crucial for classifying the tooth and inferring evolutionary relationships.:** This cusp is situated on the lingual, distal side of the upper molar.*dental morphology*, a branch of biology dedicated to studying tooth shape and function.
