Etymology:
From Middle English *cokken*, from Old English *cocc* (“male bird; cock”), of Germanic origin.  The sense of tilting or turning up likely comes from the image of a rooster cocking its head. The connection to firearms comes from the action of pulling back the hammer or other firing mechanism, often resembling the posture of a rooster.
