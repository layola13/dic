Etymology:
From over- + appreciativeness.  "Over-" is a prefix indicating "too much" or "excessive." "Appreciativeness" is derived from "appreciate," which comes from the Latin "appretiare," meaning "to set a price to" or "to value."  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "appreciative" into the noun "appreciativeness."
