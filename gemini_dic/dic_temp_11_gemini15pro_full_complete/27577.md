noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *canapé* "sofa, small piece of bread or toast upon which is served some other food," literally "sofa," from Italian *canapeo,* perhaps from Latin *conopeum* "mosquito net," from Greek *kōnōpeion* "mosquito net," from *kōnōps* "gnat, mosquito." The semantic shift occurred because the food was seen as resting on the bread like a person on a sofa.
