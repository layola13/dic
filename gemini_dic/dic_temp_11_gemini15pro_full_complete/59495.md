ETYMOLOGY->
From easterly + -ness + -es (plural suffix).  "Easterly" itself comes from "east" + "-erly" (suffix indicating direction).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "easterly" into the noun "easterliness," indicating the state or quality of being easterly.  Finally, the "-es" creates the plural form, referring to multiple instances of this state or quality.
