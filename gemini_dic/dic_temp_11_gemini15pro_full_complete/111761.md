ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "loge," meaning "gallery, covered walkway," which itself comes from Late Latin "laubia," meaning "covered walkway, portico." The meaning shifted in English to denote a small house, often associated with a particular activity. The verb sense developed from the idea of temporarily "placing" oneself or something else in a particular location.
