determinated: /dɪˈtɜːrmɪneɪtɪd/ | adj. | 决定的，坚决的 (Technically incorrect, use "determined") | This word is considered archaic or nonstandard. The correct form is "determined," which means having made a firm decision and being resolved not to change it. |  (No correct example sentence as the word is non-standard. Use "determined" instead:  The determined athlete pushed through the pain to finish the race.) | 近义词: resolute, firm, decided, resolved | 反义词: hesitant, indecisive, wavering | 词性: Adjective (Non-standard)

词源：From the Latin "determinare," past participle "determinatus," meaning "to limit, to fix, to decide." The suffix "-ed" forms the past participle, traditionally used to create adjectives.  The incorrect form "determinated" likely arose from confusion or hypercorrection.
