ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *mitre*, from Latin mitra "headband, turban," from Greek mitra, of uncertain origin. Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *meyth- “to exchange, change”. The sense development likely went from "headband" to "bishop's mitre" due to the resemblance in shape.  The verb sense "to mitre" developed from the noun, referring to the action of creating a mitered joint.
