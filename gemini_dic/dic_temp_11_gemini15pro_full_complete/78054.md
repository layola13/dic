注意事项:
*  "geoc" itself isn't a word, but a combining form, most often used as a prefix.  It's not typically used alone.  Therefore, providing antonyms and synonyms for "geoc" specifically is difficult.  The examples given relate to words starting with "geo".
* The pronunciation provided is a general approximation as the pronunciation will vary slightly depending on the word it is attached to.
