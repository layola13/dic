finon:/ˈfɪnɒn/ (British English), /ˈfaɪnɑːn/ (American English) | n. |  金融; 財務  | A finon is a term relating to finance or financial matters, though it appears to be a non-standard or archaic term.  Modern usage favors "finance" or "financial". |  While "finon" appears in some older texts referring to financial matters,  a modern example sentence is difficult to construct as it's not a commonly used word. Using it in a sentence would likely cause confusion. Instead of "The finon of the company was in disarray," one would say "The finances of the company were in disarray."| 近义词: finance, financials, funds, pecuniary resources | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps debt or liability in some contexts) | 词性: noun
