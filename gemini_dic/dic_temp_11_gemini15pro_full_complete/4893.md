词源：Old English *gelīc "like, similar, equal," from Proto-Germanic *galikaz (source also of Old Saxon gilik, Old Frisian gelik, Old Norse glikr, Dutch gelijk, German gleich), from PIE root *leik- "equal."  The word was originally an adjective, and the adverbial use developed later.  The prepositional use ("alike to") is now archaic.
