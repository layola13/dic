词源:
blackness (n.) + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality) + -'s (possessive suffix)

From black (adj.) + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality).  The possessive form "blackness's" is grammatically correct but rarely used.  It implies possession attributed to the quality of blackness itself, which is often a conceptually strained construction. It's more natural to rephrase to avoid this possessive. For instance, "the blackness of the raven's feathers" is preferable to "the blackness's of the raven's feathers."
