ETYMOLOGY->
From "backhand" (n. & adj.) + "-ed" (suffix forming adjectives) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns denoting a state or quality).  "Backhand" originally referred to a stroke in tennis or other racquet sports made with the back of the hand facing forward.  The figurative sense of "indirect" or "devious" developed from this, implying a less straightforward or honest approach.
