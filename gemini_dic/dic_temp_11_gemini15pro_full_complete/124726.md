The word "mozerobs" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It likely does not exist or is a misspelling, a neologism, or a word from a specialized field or language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.


If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, it could be:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant "mozzarella" (ˌmɒtsəˈrɛlə/  n. 马苏里拉奶酪  A type of soft Italian cheese.)
* **A technical term:**  It might be jargon specific to a certain field.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name of a person, place, or thing.
* **A slang term:** It might be informal language used within a specific group.
* **From another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from a language other than English.


If you can provide more information, I can try to provide a more useful answer.

Since I can't analyze "mozerobs," I'll use "question" as an example to demonstrate the requested format:

question:/ˈkwɛstʃən/ | n.  vt. | 问题；疑问；询问；怀疑 |  A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information. |  Example:  The student asked a question about the homework. 学生问了一个关于家庭作业的问题。 | Example: She questioned his motives. 她质疑他的动机。| Synonyms: inquiry, query | Antonyms: answer, solution | noun, verb
