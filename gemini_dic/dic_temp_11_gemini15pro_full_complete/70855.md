词源:
From Yiddish *fink, from German Fink ("finch").  The original meaning referred to a songbird, later metaphorically applied to a stool pigeon or informer, possibly due to the bird's chirping being likened to talking or tattling.  The term gained popularity in American English in the early 20th century, particularly in the context of labor disputes.
