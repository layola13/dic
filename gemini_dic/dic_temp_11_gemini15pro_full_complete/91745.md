hyperdiploidy:/ˌhaɪpərˈdɪplɔɪdi/ | n. | 超二倍体 |  The presence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes in a cell, but not a multiple of the haploid number (as opposed to triploidy, tetraploidy, etc.).  It often refers to the presence of a few extra chromosomes, not an entire extra set. | Hyperdiploidy is common in certain cancers, such as childhood leukemia. 儿童白血病中常见超二倍体。| Hyperdiploid, aneuploidy | Hypoploidy | noun
