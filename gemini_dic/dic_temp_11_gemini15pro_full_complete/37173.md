ETYMOLOGY->
"Come" comes from Old English "cuman" (to come, arrive, approach), from Proto-Germanic "*kwemaną" (to come), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*gwem-" (to go, come).  "With" comes from Old English "wiþ" (against, opposite, toward, by, near), from Proto-Germanic "*with" (against, opposite, towards), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*wi-" (apart, against, away).  The combination "come with" emerges as a phrasal verb in Middle English, taking on the meanings of accompanying or being included with something.
