PHRASE->
(Due to the technical nature of "herz", common phrases are limited.  Here are some examples using the German meaning of "heart")
Herzlichen Glückwunsch! (German) = Congratulations! 恭喜！
Mein Herz blutet. (German) = My heart bleeds. 我的心在流血。（指非常悲伤）
Von ganzem Herzen (German) = With all my heart 全心全意地
Ins Herz geschlossen (German) = Taken to heart  铭记在心
Im Herzen Europas (German) = In the heart of Europe 在欧洲的中心


注意事项:
While "herz" is sometimes used informally in English to refer to heart rate, the proper term is "beats per minute" (BPM).  虽然“herz”有时在英语中被非正式地用来指心率，但正确的术语是“每分钟心跳次数”（BPM）。
