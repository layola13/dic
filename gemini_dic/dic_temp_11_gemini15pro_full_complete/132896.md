nonelectrics:/ˌnɒnɪˈlɛktrɪks/
noun
非电介质
Substances that could not be charged by rubbing with materials like fur or wool, because they conduct electricity.  These were typically metals.
Early scientists experimented with rubbing different materials together to generate static electricity. They found some materials, which they called "electrics," could be easily charged this way (e.g., amber, glass). Others, which they called "nonelectrics," could not be charged (e.g., metals).  This was before the nature of electrical conductivity was fully understood.
Metals are nonelectrics. 金属是非电介质。
Water is a nonelectric. 水是非电介质。
Synonym: conductor
Antonym: electric, insulator
n.
