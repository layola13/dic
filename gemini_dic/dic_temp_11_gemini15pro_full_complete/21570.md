Etymology: From "bluestocking," a term for an intellectual woman, especially of the 18th and 19th centuries.  The term originally referred to informal literary gatherings hosted by women, where attendees wore everyday blue worsted stockings instead of formal black silk stockings.  Over time, "bluestocking" became associated with learned women, sometimes with a negative connotation of pretentiousness or excessive intellectualism.  The suffix "-isms" denotes the characteristic practices or doctrines of bluestockings.
