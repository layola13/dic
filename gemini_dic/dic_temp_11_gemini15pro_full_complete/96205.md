注意事项:  "Index's" itself is not commonly used as a standalone word. It is almost always followed by a noun to specify which index is being referred to.  The possessive form emphasizes that the following noun belongs to or is associated with the index.  For example, "the stock market's index" or "the book's index."  It is more natural to say "the index of the stock market" or "the index of the book."
