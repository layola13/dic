词源:  "Flickermouse" is a relatively recent coinage, likely inspired by the flitting, erratic flight of bats, which the word "flicker" evokes.  "Mouse" likely refers to the bat's small, rodent-like appearance.  It's not a standard scientific term, but rather a more evocative and literary descriptor.
