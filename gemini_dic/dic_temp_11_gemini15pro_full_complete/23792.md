PHRASE->
(Given the informal and regional nature of "brax" as a verb, set phrases are unlikely.  As a noun, it's a specific item of clothing and doesn't lend itself to common phrases either. Therefore, offering generic phrases related to clothing or boasting.)


Put on your brax.  穿上你的粗布裤子。
He's always braxing about something. 他总是吹嘘些什么。

ETYMOLOGY->
"Brax" as trousers originates from a brand name, "Braemar," associated with a style of tough outdoor trousers.

"Brax" as a verb is likely related to the Scots word "brag" or "bragg," meaning to boast.  Its connection to the clothing brand is coincidental.
