Etymology: From Middle English *eschewen*, from Old French *eschiver* (Modern French *échouer* "to fail, run aground"), from Frankish *skiuhan*, from Proto-Germanic *skeuhwijaną* (“to shy away, avoid”). Cognate with Middle High German *schiuhen* (“to avoid”), Middle Dutch *schuwen* (“to shun”), Old English *sċēohian* (“to shun, avoid”).  The sense shifted in French from "shy away" to "fail" and then to "run aground"; only the original sense is retained in English.
