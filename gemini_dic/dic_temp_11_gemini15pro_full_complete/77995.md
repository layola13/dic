ETYMOLOGY->
From gentle + folk.  "Gentle" originally referred to those of noble birth or high social standing, and "folk" simply means people. So, "gentlefolk" literally means "people of gentle birth." Over time, its meaning broadened to include people of good breeding and refined manners, regardless of their actual social status.
