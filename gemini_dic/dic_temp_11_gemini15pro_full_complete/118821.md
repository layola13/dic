metanephridial:/ˌmɛtəˈnɛfrɪdiəl/
adjective
后肾管的
Relating to or denoting metanephridia, a type of excretory gland found in many invertebrates, such as annelids and mollusks.  These tubules typically have an internal opening (nephrostome) that collects coelomic fluid and an external opening (nephridiopore) that expels waste.
Metanephridia are crucial for osmoregulation and excretion in earthworms. 后肾管对蚯蚓的渗透调节和排泄至关重要。
The metanephridial system of mollusks varies considerably among different species.  软体动物的后肾管系统在不同物种之间差异很大。
Synonym: nephridial
Antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical term.  One could consider structures with different excretory functions, like protonephridia, as functionally contrasting.)
词性: adjective
