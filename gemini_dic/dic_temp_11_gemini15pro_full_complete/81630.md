注意事项：

*  "Greeces" is an unusual plural. While grammatically correct, it is seldom used in modern English.  Using "Greece" in the singular or referring to specific regions or city-states within Greece is generally preferred.  The examples above utilize "greeces" primarily in a metaphorical or historical context to illustrate different facets of ancient Greek civilization. If you are referring to modern Greece, use the singular form.
