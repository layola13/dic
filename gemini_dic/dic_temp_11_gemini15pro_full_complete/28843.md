ETYMOLOGY->
From "carpenter" + "-ed." "Carpenter" comes from Old French "charpentier," from Late Latin "carpentarius," meaning "cartwright" or "wagon-maker," ultimately derived from Latin "carpentum," meaning "two-wheeled cart." The suffix "-ed" forms the past participle and past tense of verbs, and is also used to create adjectives.
