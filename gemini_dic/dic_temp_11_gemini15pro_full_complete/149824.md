##paleomagnetic:/ˌpeɪliˌoʊmæɡˈnɛtɪk/ | adj. | 古地磁的；古磁场的|past.  Paleomagnetism provides valuable insights into plate tectonics, continental drift, and the Earth's magnetic field reversals over millions of years.The study involves measuring the remanent magnetization of rocks, which is the magnetization acquired during their formation. This remanent magnetism is a record of the Earth's magnetic field at that time.studies have confirmed the theory of continental drift.  古地磁研究证实了大陆漂移学说。地磁数据揭示了数百万年前地球磁场极性发生了重大变化。onym, but terms like "modern magnetic" or "present-day magnetic" could be considered opposites in the sense of referring to the current magnetic field instead of the past.*   **magnetic**: From Greek *magnētis* (λίθος) meaning "magnet stone" (referring to magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral).It describes properties, data, or studies related to the Earth's magnetism in past geological epochs.  It is often used to modify nouns like "data," "studies," "anomalies," "record," "evidence," "inversion," and "field."discourse.  In everyday conversation, it would be highly unusual and likely unintelligible to most people.
