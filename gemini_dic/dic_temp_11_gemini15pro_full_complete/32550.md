ETYMOLOGY->
"chipper" (adjective) comes from the verb "chip," meaning to cut or break small pieces from something.  The sense of being cheerful likely developed from the idea of birds chirping, which are often associated with happiness and liveliness.  The noun "chipper" referring to a wood-chipping machine is a later development, derived from the verb.
