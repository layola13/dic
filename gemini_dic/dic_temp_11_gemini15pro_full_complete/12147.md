aruo:  This word doesn't appear to be a valid English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (like the language it's from, or the sentence you saw it in), I can try to help further.

Since "aruo" isn't a recognized English word, I can't provide the requested breakdown. However, I can offer an example with a real word, "axiom," following your requested format:

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理; 定理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应该与恐怖分子谈判，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。

Example: One of the key axioms of the theory of evolution is that all life is related.  进化论的一个关键公理是所有生命都是相关的。


|Synonym:  principle, theorem, postulate| Antonym: paradox, fallacy | noun
