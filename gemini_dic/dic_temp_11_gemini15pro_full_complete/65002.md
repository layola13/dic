Etymology->
From French *estrapade*, from Italian *strappare* "to pull, tear, wrench," from Vulgar Latin *extirpare* "to uproot, eradicate" (from Latin *ex* "out" + *stirps* "root, stock").  The sense shifted from the pulling or wrenching action to the device used for it, and then to the punishment itself.
