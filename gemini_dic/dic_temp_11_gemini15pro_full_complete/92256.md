hypervariably:/ˌhaɪpərˈvɛəriəbli/| adv.|高度可变地|In a highly variable manner; with a high degree of variability.  This refers to regions of molecules, like antibodies, that exhibit significant variation in their amino acid sequence.|The antibody's binding site mutates hypervariably, allowing it to adapt to different antigens.|近义词:highly variably, extremely variably|反义词:invariably, constantly|词性:副词

Etymology:
hyper- (prefix): from Greek "hyper," meaning "over, beyond, excessive"
variable (adjective): from Late Latin "variabilis," meaning "changeable"
-ly (suffix): forms adverbs from adjectives
