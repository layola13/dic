ETYMOLOGY->

From "name" + "check."  "Name" comes from Old English "nama," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*namō."  "Check" comes from Old French "eschec" (noun), "eschequier" (verb), referring to chess and the act of hindering the king. The meaning evolved to include "verification" in the 19th century.
