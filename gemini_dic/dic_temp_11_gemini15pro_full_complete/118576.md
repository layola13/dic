mesosphere:/ˈmɛsoʊsfɪr/| n. |中间层|The region of the earth's atmosphere above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere, between about 50 and 85 km in altitude.|The mesosphere is where most meteors burn up.|Synonyms: middle atmosphere|Antonyms: N/A|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From meso- "middle" + sphere "ball, globe."  "Meso-" comes from the Greek "mesos," meaning "middle." "Sphere" comes from the Greek "sphaira," meaning "ball" or "globe."
