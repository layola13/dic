Etymology:
From Middle English *ancientnes, derived from ancient + -ness.  "Ancient" comes from Old French "ancien"  (meaning "old, former, of long ago"), ultimately from Latin "ante" (meaning "before") and possibly related to "antianus," meaning "former, previous." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
