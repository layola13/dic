aethogen:/ˈiːθədʒən/ | n. | 乙烯发生器; 乙烯产生器 | A substance or device that generates ethylene. | This fruit releases aethogen, accelerating the ripening of nearby produce. 这种水果会释放乙烯，加速附近农产品的成熟。 | 近义词: ethylene producer, ethylene generator | 反义词: ethylene inhibitor | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From Greek *αἴθω (aíthō, “I burn, kindle”) + -gen, from Greek -γενής (-genḗs, “born from, produced by”).  Relates to ethylene's original discovery as a component of illuminating gas.
