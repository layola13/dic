词源: "Keep" comes from Old English *cēpan "to observe, attend to, take care of," from Proto-Germanic *kopijaną. "Fit" comes from Old English *fett "plump, fleshy," from Proto-Germanic *faitiz "fat." The modern meaning of "fit" as "in good physical condition" developed later.  The hyphenated term "keep-fit" emerged in the 20th century to describe activities aimed at maintaining physical fitness.
