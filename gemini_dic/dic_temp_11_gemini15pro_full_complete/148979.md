##oviposition/ | /ˌoʊvɪˈpoʊzɪʃən/| n. | 卵生；产卵 | The act of laying eggs.  This term is specifically used in biology and entomology to refer to the processby which an animal deposits its eggs. This process often involves a complex series of behaviors, including site selection, egg attachment, and post-oviposition care.| The monarch butterfly undergoes oviposition on milkweed plants.  帝王蝶在乳草植物上产卵。The study focused on the oviposition behavior of the parasitic wasp. 这项研究关注寄生黄蜂的产卵行为。|  laying, spawning |  (近义词过于笼统，需根据具体语境选择更精确的词语) |  (无明确反义词，可考虑表达相反含义的词组，如“livebirth”)it from simply laying eggs in a broader non-technical sense. The suffix "-ition" is a common noun-forming suffix in English derived from Latin.to use it in a context where the precise biological act of egg-laying is relevant, differentiating it from the general act of depositing things.  In everyday conversation, simpler terms like "laying eggs" would generally suffice. However, for scientific or technical writing, its specific use enhances clarity and precision.  The term's usage in research literature involves careful description of the location, timing, and manner of egg deposition, often contextualized within behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology.  Studies may examine factors influencing oviposition site selection, such as host plant quality (for herbivorous insects), predator avoidance, and competition among females. Research on oviposition also plays a major role in pest management and conservation strategies for endangered species where reproductive success is critical.of oviposition is crucial for the survival of the offspring. 产卵时间对后代的生存至关重要。history of this insect group. 对产卵模式的研究揭示了该昆虫群体进化史的见解。large number of eggs into the water.strategies.
