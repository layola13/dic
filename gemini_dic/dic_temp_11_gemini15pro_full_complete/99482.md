interferometricly:/ˌɪntərˌfɪrəˈmɛtrɪkli/ | adv. | 干涉测量地 | In a way that relates to or uses interferometry.  | The distances were measured interferometricly using a laser. 用激光干涉测量法测量距离。 | 近义词:  N/A (highly specific term) | 反义词: N/A (highly specific term) | 词性: 副词

Etymology:
From "interferometer" + "-ic" + "-al" + "-ly".  "Interferometer" comes from "interfere" (from Latin "inter-" meaning "between" and "ferire" meaning "to strike") + "-meter" (from Greek "metron" meaning "measure").
