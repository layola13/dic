PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases.  "Floridnesses" is a relatively uncommon word itself and is typically used on its own to describe a quality of language.)

词源：From florid + -ness.  Florid comes from the Latin word "floridus," meaning "blooming" or "flowery," relating to the blossoming of flowers, which can be seen as analogous to elaborate or ornate language.
