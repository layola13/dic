antepredicament:/ˈæntiprɪˈdɪkəm(ə)nt/
n.
先范畴，预范畴
A concept or category that is more fundamental than a predicable, often used in medieval logic and metaphysics.  These are concepts so basic they precede being classified as a genus, species, differentia, property, or accident.
Aristotle's *Categories* discusses "being" as an example of an antepredicament.  It's a concept that applies to everything else but isn't a predicate itself in the same way "red" is.
