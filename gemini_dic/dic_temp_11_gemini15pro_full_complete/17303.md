词源：  "bcc" stands for "blind carbon copy."  The term originates from the era of typewriters and carbon paper, where a "blind copy" was made by placing a piece of carbon paper behind the original document but without an addressed envelope. This created a copy that the primary recipient wouldn't know about.  This practice was then adapted to email communication.
