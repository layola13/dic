PHRASE-> (Not applicable. "Heh" is rarely used in set phrases.)


注意事项:  "Heh" is more of an onomatopoeia representing a sound rather than a word with rich grammatical usage. It's primarily used as an interjection to convey a nuanced emotion, often derision, skepticism, or amusement.  It's important to note its informal nature and potential for misinterpretation.
