The word "ealth" is not a valid English word.  Did you perhaps mean "health"?  I will proceed with the analysis of "health".

health: /hɛlθ/ | n. | 健康 | The state of being free from illness or injury.  A person's mental or physical condition. | Example:  He is in good health. 他身体健康。 | Example:  She worried about her family's health. 她担心家人的健康。 | 近义词: wellness, well-being | 反义词: illness, sickness | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Old English *hǣlþu (attested only in derived forms such as hǣlþīġ 'healthy'), from Proto-Germanic *hailiþō, from Proto-Indo-European *kóil-o-  "whole, uninjured." Related to "whole."
