##ovipositor:/ˈoʊvɪpɒzɪtər/ |n. |产卵器|a tube-like organ possessed by some female insects, and some other arthropods, used to deposit eggs.  The structure and function vary greatly depending on thespecies.  In some insects, it's a simple, short tube; in others, it's a complex, modified appendage capable of piercing planttissues or animal skin to lay eggs inside. The ovipositor often incorporates sensory structures that help the female locate suitable sites for egg-laying.  The evolution of the ovipositor demonstrates remarkable adaptability to diverse ecological niches.The wasp used its sharp ovipositor to lay its eggs inside the caterpillar.  黄蜂用它锋利的产卵器将卵产在毛毛虫体内。deep into the wood to deposit its eggs.  姬蜂的长产卵器使它能够深入木材产卵。t a direct antonym, as it's not describing a state or condition.  Perhaps indirectly,  "male reproductive organ" could be considered a contrasting concept, although it's not strictly an antonym in the same way as "positive" and "negative".positus*, past participle of *oviponere*, "to lay eggs," from *ovum* "egg" + *ponere* "to lay, place".  The suffix *-tor* is a common agent suffix in Latin, indicating the thing that performs the action.word "ovipositor" is primarily used in biological and entomological contexts. It's essential to understand that it's a specialized anatomical structure, not a general term for egg-laying.  Avoid using it in casual conversation; it's a technical term belonging to scientific discourse.  Its usage is generally restrictedto descriptions of insect and arthropod biology, comparative morphology, and evolutionary studies.
