词源：From Old English *loccan (unattested) "to fasten, confine, enclose," from Proto-Germanic *lukjanan (source also of Old Frisian lokia, Dutch luiken "to close, shut," Old High German luhhan, German lücken "to close," Old Norse luka "to lock, close"), from PIE root *(s)lēug- "to bend, twist."  The original sense was "to fasten by bending or twisting," as with a hook or other flexible fastener. The noun is from the verb.
