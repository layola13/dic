ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *anthera, from Ancient Greek ἀνθηρός (anthērós, “flowery, blooming”), from ἄνθος (ánthos, “flower”).  The shift in meaning from "flowering" to specifically "anther" likely occurred because the anther is the part of the flower most visibly associated with blooming and pollen production.
