词源: From Old French *despareragier (attested as desparager "to marry someone of unequal rank, to degrade"), from des- "away, down" + parage "lineage, rank", from Latin par "equal".  The original sense in English was "to marry (a person) to someone of inferior rank". The sense shifted to "to lower in rank or estimation" in the late 16th century.
