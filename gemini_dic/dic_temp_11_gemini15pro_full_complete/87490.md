heteroblastic:/ˌhɛtərəˈblæstɪk/| adj.|异形叶性的，异龄性的|Exhibiting different forms or stages of development in different parts or at different ages, especially referring to leaves.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe plants that have dissimilar juvenile and adult leaves.|Example:  The eucalyptus tree exhibits heteroblastic leaf development, with juvenile leaves being round and adult leaves being sickle-shaped.  桉树表现出异形叶性发育，幼叶呈圆形，成叶呈镰刀形。

Example: Many climbing plants show heteroblastic growth, with the juvenile form being more adapted to shade and the adult form to sun. 许多攀缘植物表现出异龄性生长，幼年形态更适应阴凉，成年形态更适应阳光。|近义词：anisophyllous, polymorphic|反义词：homoblastic|词性: adjective
