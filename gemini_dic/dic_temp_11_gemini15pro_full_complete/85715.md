词源:  From Middle English hawe, from Old English haga, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *hagō (“hedge, enclosure”). Cognate with Scots haw (“hedge, enclosure”), West Frisian hage (“hedge”), Dutch haag (“hedge”), German Hag (“hedge, fence”), Swedish hage (“pasture, enclosure”).  源自中古英语 hawe，来自古英语 haga，最终来自原始日耳曼语 *hagō（“树篱，围栏”）。 与苏格兰语 haw（“树篱，围栏”）、西弗里斯兰语 hage（“树篱”）、荷兰语 haag（“树篱”）、德语 Hag（“树篱，栅栏”）、瑞典语 hage（“牧场，围栏”）同源。
