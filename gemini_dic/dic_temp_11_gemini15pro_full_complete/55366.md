distantnesses:/ˈdɪstəntnəsɪz/ | n. | 遥远，距离 | The vast distantnesses of space.  浩瀚遥远的宇宙空间。 |  例句：The distantnesses between the stars are almost incomprehensible. 星星之间的距离几乎难以理解。

例句：The astronomer calculated the distantnesses to several galaxies. 天文学家计算了到几个星系的距离。 | 近义词：remoteness, distances, farness | 反义词：nearness, closeness, proximity | 词性：名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From distant + -ness.  来自distant（遥远的）+ -ness（名词后缀，表示状态或性质）。  Distant itself comes from Old French distant, ultimately from Latin distans, present participle of distare "to stand apart," from dis- "apart" + stare "to stand."
