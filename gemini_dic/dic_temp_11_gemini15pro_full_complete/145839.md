overdeliciousnesses:/ˌoʊvər dɪˈlɪʃəsnɪsɪz/ | n. | 过于美味的食物；极度的美味 |  An excessive or extreme degree of deliciousness.  It's a humorous and exaggerated way to describe something incredibly tasty. | The bakery's overdeliciousnesses were too tempting to resist.  这家面包店的美味佳肴太诱人了，无法抗拒。| Synonyms: delicacies, treats, delights | Antonyms: blandness, unappetizingness | noun

Etymology:
"Over-" (prefix) + "delicious" (adjective) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns from adjectives)

"Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much."
"Delicious" comes from Old French "delicieux," ultimately from Latin "deliciosus" ("delightful").
"-ness" transforms the adjective "delicious" into the noun "deliciousness."  Adding the plural "-es" creates "overdeliciousnesses," emphasizing a multitude of extremely delicious things.
