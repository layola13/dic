mho:/moʊ/| n.|姆欧，电导单位|A mho is the reciprocal of an ohm, the unit of electrical resistance. It represents how easily a material conducts electricity.  (姆欧是欧姆的倒数，欧姆是电阻单位。它表示一种材料导电的容易程度。)|The conductance of this wire is 0.5 mho. (这根导线的电导是0.5姆欧。)|近义词:siemens|反义词:ohm|词性:noun

Etymology:  "mho" is derived by writing "ohm" backwards.  This was suggested by Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1883. The term siemens, named after Ernst Werner von Siemens, is now the preferred term.
