chromatography:/ˌkroʊməˈtɑːɡrəfi/ | n. | 色谱法 | A laboratory technique used to separate mixtures into their component parts.  It works by exploiting the differences in how the components interact with a stationary phase (like a solid material) and a mobile phase (like a liquid or gas). |  Gas chromatography was used to identify the different chemicals in the sample.  气相色谱法被用来鉴定样品中不同的化学物质。| synonyms: separation, analysis | antonyms: mixture, combination | noun

chromatographic:/ˌkroʊməˌtəˈɡræfɪk/ | adj. | 色谱的 | Relating to or using chromatography. | The chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of impurities. 色谱分析揭示了杂质的存在。| synonyms: separative | antonyms: combined | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *khrōmat-* (color) + *-graphein* (to write).  Originally coined because the technique was used to separate colored pigments.
