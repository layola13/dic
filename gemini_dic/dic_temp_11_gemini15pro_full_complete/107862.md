ETYMOLOGY->
From "large" + "scale". "Large" comes from Old French "large" (meaning wide, spacious, liberal), ultimately from Latin "largus" (meaning abundant, copious, plentiful). "Scale" comes from Old Norse "skál" (meaning bowl, scale), related to Old English "scealu" (meaning shell, husk, scale).
