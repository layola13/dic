词源：
From Middle English *nice, from Old French nice “foolish, simple, ignorant; careless, clumsy; weak, poor, thin, slender; lascivious, wanton”, from Latin nescius “ignorant, unaware”, from ne- “not” + scius “knowing”.  The semantic shift from "silly" to "pleasing" occurred over time, influenced by senses such as "finely dressed" and "fastidious."
