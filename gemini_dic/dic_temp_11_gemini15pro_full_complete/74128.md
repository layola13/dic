词源：From Old French *fuls, *fols (modern French fol), from Late Latin *follis “bellows, leather bag,” from Latin follis “bellows, money bag.” The semantic development is from the idea of something inflated or puffed up, hence “swollen, diseased,” then “rotten, putrid,” and finally “morally offensive.”
