词性: 名词

词源:  From in- + considerate + -ness + -es.  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "considerate," which means showing careful thought for others.  The suffix "-ness" forms a noun from the adjective "inconsiderate," indicating the state or quality of being inconsiderate. Finally, the suffix "-es" creates the plural form.
