ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *flagge*, from Old Norse *flaga* (“to flap, flutter”), from Proto-Germanic *flaggōną* (“to fly, float, flutter”), from Proto-Indo-European *pleg- (“to strike, hit lightly”).  The evolution of meaning likely progressed from the fluttering motion of a piece of cloth to its use as a signal or symbol.
