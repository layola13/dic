ETYMOLOGY->
From "hep," slang for "aware" or "in the know" (1940s), which evolved into "hip" and then "hipster."  The exact origins of "hep" are uncertain, but it likely emerged from African American jazz culture.  The term "hipster" gained prominence in the 1940s and 50s to describe followers of bebop jazz and the associated lifestyle. It later reappeared in the 1990s and 2000s with a new meaning, referring to a subculture focused on indie music, vintage fashion, and a perceived ironic detachment.
