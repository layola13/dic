##parameter /pəˈræmɪtər/ | n. | 参数，参量，因素 |or characteristic that can take on different values, influencing the outcome of a process or system. It's often used in mathematics, statistics, computer programming, andother fields to represent a configurable aspect or input that affects the behavior of a model, function, or process.  In some contexts, particularly in programming, "parameter" and "argument" are used interchangeably, though technically, a parameter is a variable in a function definition, while an argument is the value passed to that parameter during a function call.s accuracy depends on several key parameters, such as the learning rate and the number of training epochs.** 模型的准确性取决于几个关键参数，例如学习率和训练周期数。algorithm to optimize its performance.** 我们需要调整算法的参数以优化其性能。could consider terms implying the opposite of being adjustable or configurable, such as "fixed," "invariant," or "constant".root "para-" means "beside" or "alongside," and "metron" means "measure." This origin reflects the role parameters play as values that measure or influence alongside other variables.mathematics, a parameter is a variable used in a function that influences the output but is not considered a direct input.  Think of the equation of a circle: $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. Here, '$r$' is the parameter—it changes the size of the circle.**Statistics:** In statistics, parameters describe the population (e.g., population mean, population standard deviation).  These are often estimated from samples.values supplied to those parameters when the function is called., number of hidden layers).
