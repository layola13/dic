词源：From Middle English *darne, *derne, from Old English *dearn, *diern (“hidden, secret”), from Proto-Germanic *darnaz (“hidden”). Related to Old High German tarnen (“to hide, conceal”).  The sense development from "hidden mend" to "mend" is straightforward.  The use as a euphemism for "damn" arose in the 18th century.
