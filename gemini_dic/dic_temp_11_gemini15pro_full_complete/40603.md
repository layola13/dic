convectively:/kənˈvɛktɪvli/ | adv. | 对流地，通过对流 | In meteorology, it describes processes related to convection, such as the rising of warm air.  在气象学中，它描述与对流有关的过程，例如暖空气的上升。 | The heat is transferred convectively through the liquid. 热量通过液体对流传递。 | 近义词: through convection, by convection | 反义词: conductively, radiatively | 词性: 副词

ETYMOLOGY->
From "convective" + "-ly".  "Convective" comes from the Latin "convectus," the past participle of "convehere," meaning "to carry together." "-ly" is a suffix forming adverbs.  源自“convective”+“-ly”。 “Convective”来自拉丁语“convectus”，是“convehere”的过去分词，意思是“一起携带”。 “-ly”是一个构成副词的后缀。
