##oxides:/ˈɒksaɪdz/| n. |氧化物|氧和一种或多种其他元素的化合物，通常是金属。|Example:Iron oxide is a common rust.  氧化铁是常见的锈。|近义词：compound |反义词：无The word "oxide" originates from the French word *oxyde*, which itself comes from the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier's work in the late18th century.  Lavoisier, considered the "father of modern chemistry,"  identified oxygen as a key element and coined the term "oxyde" to describe compounds formed by the combination of oxygen with other elements.  TheEnglish word "oxide" was subsequently borrowed from French, reflecting the significant influence of French scientific terminology during that period.  The root "oxy-" comes from the Greek word  ὀξύς (oxys), meaning "sharp," "acid,"or "sour," reflecting the acidic nature of many oxides when dissolved in water.a breakdown of its usage:(e.g., carbon dioxide, $CO_2$). The properties of oxides vary drastically; some are basic, some are acidic, and some are amphoteric (behaving as both acids and bases). The charge and oxidation state of the other element determine the chemical formula of the oxide.:** Oxides are used extensively in many manufacturing processes.  For instance, titanium dioxide ($TiO_2$) is a crucial pigment in paints and other coatings due to its bright white color. Aluminium oxide ($Al_2O_3$), also known as alumina, is a significant component in ceramics and abrasives.Silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$), commonly known as silica, is the primary component of sand and is used in glass manufacturing.The browning of fruit is also a consequence of oxidation reactions, as oxygen interacts with enzymes and other compounds in the fruit.glass.** (二氧化硅是玻璃的主要成分。)t a direct antonym for "oxide" because it is not a naturally occurring opposite. The concept of its opposite might be to describe the process that results in its disappearance.  For example, reduction is a chemical process to remove oxygen from an oxide.  But there's no single word to denote the *absence* of oxides.
