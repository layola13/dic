ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *champion, from Late Latin campionem (nominative campio) "gladiator, fighter in the campus (field of Mars)," from Latin campus "field, plain."  The sense shifted from "fighter in the field" to "fighter for a cause" to "champion." The botanical sense comes from the resemblance of some species' flowers to the ragged clothing of medieval champions.
