词源:  "old-worldliness" comes from "old-world" + "-liness". "Old-world" refers to the Eastern Hemisphere, specifically Europe, Asia, and Africa, before the discovery of the Americas. The suffix "-liness" transforms an adjective into a noun indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "old-worldliness" refers to the qualities or characteristics associated with the old world, often implying traditionalism, formality, and a connection to the past.
