PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  The following are example sentences using synonyms in common phrases, showing how "disport" could theoretically be used - but it would sound archaic and unnatural in modern English.)

What's up?  ->  How are you disporting yourself today? (very unnatural)
what if -> What if we disport ourselves by going to the beach? (very unnatural)
what for -> What did they bring those toys for? To disport themselves, of course. (slightly more natural, but still archaic)


词源：From Middle English disporten, from Old French desporter, deporter (“to carry away, divert, amuse, recreate”), from des- (variant of dis-) + porter (“to carry”).  Meaning shifted from "diverting oneself from cares" to "amusing oneself."
