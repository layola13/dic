ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *beseken*, from Old English *besēcan* (“to seek, beseech, beg, entreat”), equivalent to *be-* + *sēcan* (“to seek”). Cognate with Dutch *bezoeken* (“to visit”), German *besuchen* (“to visit”).  The original sense was "to seek," later narrowing to "seek earnestly," hence "beg, implore."
