Etymology:
From non- + remit + -able + -ly.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not". "Remit" comes from Latin "remittere," meaning "to send back, slacken, abate." "-able" forms an adjective meaning "capable of being." "-ly" forms an adverb.  Therefore, "nonremittably" means "in a way that cannot be slackened or abated."
