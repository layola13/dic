词源:
The word "ilad" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a rare archaic word.  If you meant "clad," then its etymology is as follows:  From Old English *ġeclæded, past participle of ġeclædan (“to clothe”), from Proto-Germanic *kladjaną (“to clothe”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱel- (“to cover, conceal”). Cognate with Dutch kleden (“to dress, clothe”), German kleiden (“to dress, clothe”), Icelandic klæða (“to clothe”).
