词源: de- (prefix meaning "remove" or "reverse") + select + -ing (present participle suffix).  The prefix "de-" comes from Latin, meaning "down from," "away from," "off," "reversal," "removal," or "intensity."  "Select" comes from the Latin "selectus," past participle of "seligere," meaning "to choose apart."
