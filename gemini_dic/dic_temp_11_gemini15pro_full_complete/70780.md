The word "fingens" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language.  If you meant something else, please provide the correct spelling.

However, since the prompt requests information on the word "what," assuming this might be the intended meaning behind the garbled word, I'll provide information for "what":

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv. int.|什么，多么| What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | similar: which, who | opposite: N/A (Not applicable for question words) | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection
