注意事项:  "haa" itself is not a formal English word.  It's an onomatopoeia or interjection, and its pronunciation can vary slightly depending on the emotion it expresses.  I've provided two possible pronunciations and interpretations above.  The extensive grammar examples you requested are for the word "what," as "haa" doesn't fit into those grammatical structures.
