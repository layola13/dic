##pseudopod:  伪足/ | n. | 伪足 |  A temporary protrusion of thecytoplasm of a cell, used for locomotion or engulfing food.  It's a temporary extension of a cell's cytoplasm that helps it move or capturefood. | 例句：Amoebas use pseudopods to move and feed. (变形虫用伪足移动和摄食。)  The white bloodcells used pseudopods to engulf the bacteria. (白细胞用伪足吞噬细菌。) | 近义词：protoplasm extension (细胞质延伸) | 反义词：无 (没有直接的反义词，可以考虑与细胞稳定结构进行对比) |  名词meaning "foot."  Therefore, "pseudopod" literally translates to "false foot." This reflects its function as a temporary, foot-like projection used for movement rather than a permanent, structurally defined appendage like a true leg. The term itself emerged in the late 19th century with the advancement of microscopyand the study of single-celled organisms.Different types of pseudopods exist, including lobopods (blunt, rounded projections), filopods (fine, thread-like projections), and reticulopods (branched, net-like projections), each with potentially slightly different mechanisms of formation and function.cytoplasm and the cell membrane.  The cell's internal contents flow into the extending projection, causing it to elongate.  Adhesion to a surface is crucial for effective movement, often relying on the interaction of specific proteins on the pseudopod's surface.  Retraction of the pseudopod occurs through the controlled reversalof these processes.feeding, it is crucial to understand this term and its implications.✩伪足的形成机制中，肌动蛋白丝聚合和解聚的精确调控机制是什么？，还有哪些生物或细胞结构也运用类似伪足的运动方式？在医学或材料科学领域有哪些潜在应用？
