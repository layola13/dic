PHRASE->
(Due to the informal and dialectal nature of "amn't," it doesn't readily form set phrases.  The following are examples of how it *could* be used, but these are not established phrases.)

注意事项:

"Amn't" is largely considered non-standard and is rarely used outside of specific dialects, primarily in Scotland and Ireland.  Even in those dialects, its usage is declining. Using "aren't I" or "am I not" is generally preferred in standard English.  The examples provided for less common tenses illustrate potential usage but might sound archaic or unnatural to most native speakers.
