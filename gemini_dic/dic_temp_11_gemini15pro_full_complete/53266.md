词源: From "dirge" (a funeral hymn or lament) + "-like" (suffix meaning "resembling").  "Dirge" ultimately comes from the Latin "dirige,"  the imperative form of "dirigere" ("to direct"), referring to the opening words of the Latin funeral service, "Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam" ("Direct, O Lord my God, my way in thy sight").
