注意事项:
The word "gimleted" is not as commonly used as its noun form "gimlet". It is primarily used as a descriptive adjective for something that has been pierced with a gimlet or has a gimlet-like shape.  It can also refer to something equipped with gimbals, a pivoted support that allows rotation in multiple axes, often used for compasses or gyroscopes. However, this usage is less common.
