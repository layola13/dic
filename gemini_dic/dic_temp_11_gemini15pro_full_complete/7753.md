anorthite: /ˈænɔːrθaɪt/ | n. |钙长石|A plagioclase feldspar mineral, CaAl2Si2O8, the calcium end-member of the plagioclase series. It is typically white to gray or reddish and is found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. |Anorthite is a common constituent of lunar rocks.  钙长石是月球岩石的常见成分。

Anorthite crystals were found in the volcanic ash. 在火山灰中发现了钙长石晶体。|近义词: plagioclase (更广义的斜长石)|反义词:  (没有明确的反义词，可以考虑其他类型的长石，例如albite钠长石) |词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *anorthosite*, from Ancient Greek ἀν- (an-, “not, without”) + ὀρθός (orthós, “straight, right”) + -ite.  The name refers to its triclinic (not right-angled) crystallization.
