词源:  From institution + -ize + -ed.  The verb "institutionalize" comes from the noun "institution," which itself comes from the Latin "institutio," meaning "establishment" or "instruction."  The suffix "-ize" turns the noun into a verb meaning "to make into an institution," and the suffix "-ed" creates the past participle form, used as an adjective.
