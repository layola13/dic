词源: "outhiss" is a blend of "out" and "hiss". "Out" indicates removal or expulsion, while "hiss" refers to the sound made as an expression of disapproval.  This word is likely a neologism or a relatively recent coinage, as it's not found in standard dictionaries. Its meaning is derived from the combination of its constituent parts.
