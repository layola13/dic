##paraphysis:/pærəˈfaɪsɪs/ | n.| 副萼 | 副萼片；副花冠 |:**structures typically arise from the same tissue as the reproductive organs but do not themselves participate in reproduction. They often have a protective or supportive function, helping to shield thereproductive organs (such as sporangia or asci) from environmental stress or providing a structural framework.  In lichens, paraphyses are filiform (thread-like) structures emerging from the hymenium (the spore-bearing layer) and interspersed between the asci. Their exact function in lichens remains partially uncertain, but they're thought to aid in spore dispersal or offer protection. In some fungi, paraphyses can be more complex in structure.  The morphology andarrangement of paraphyses can be important taxonomic characteristics, helping to identify different species.paraphyses in the fungal fruiting body. (显微镜检查显示真菌子实体中存在大量副萼片。)or "protective outgrowth" might convey some of its meaning in context.  It depends heavily on the context (fungi, lichen, etc).are found, providing a contrasting element.  Asci actively participate in reproduction, unlike paraphyses.and "physis" (φύσις), meaning "nature" or "growth." This etymology aptly describes its location and nature as a non-reproductive structure alongside reproductive organs.  The word was first coined during the development of modern botanical terminology, its precise origin within botanical literature would require more specific historical researchwithin botanical publication archives.
