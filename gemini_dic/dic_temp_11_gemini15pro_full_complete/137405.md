nonterm:/ˈnɒntɜːm/ | n. | 非终结符 |A symbol or string of symbols that can be replaced by other symbols according to a set of rules, especially in formal language theory.  A nonterminal symbol is a placeholder in a grammar that can be expanded into other symbols, ultimately leading to a terminal string.  Often contrasted with "terminal." |  The grammar defines "sentence" as a nonterm that can be rewritten as "noun phrase" followed by "verb phrase."  这个语法将“句子”定义为一个非终结符，可以改写为“名词短语”后跟“动词短语”。 | synonym: variable, placeholder | antonym: terminal | noun
