```n. |邻甲基苯酚|A phenolic compound that is a methylderivative of phenol. It exists as three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) differing in the position of the methyl group relative to the hydroxyl group.It's primarily used as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals.  Its distinctive odor is often described as medicinal or antiseptic.|Examples: The synthesis ofoxytoluene derivatives is a complex process involving multiple steps.  邻甲基苯酚衍生物的合成是一个涉及多个步骤的复杂过程。  Studies have investigated the potential applications of oxytoluene in various industries.  研究人员调查了邻甲基苯酚在各个行业的潜在应用。|近义词：creosol (depending on isomer)|反义词：N/Ais a combination of:toluene:** This refers to the aromatic hydrocarbon toluene, $C_7H_8$, which is a methyl-substituted benzene.CH_3$) relative to the hydroxyl group ($-OH$) on the benzene ring.Its industrial applications largely focus on its conversion into other valuable chemicals.  More specific applications might require knowing the precise isomer being used as properties (e.g., reactivity, melting point) vary significantly between ortho, meta, and para-oxytoluene.  Further research into specific applications would depend on the intended use and isomerin question.  The potential environmental impact and safety handling procedures would also need to be addressed in any industrial use.  More detailed information on these points would require access to specialized chemical safety data sheets (SDS) specific to each oxytoluene isomer.
