galvanotonus: /ˌɡælvənəˈtoʊnəs/ | n. |电流刺激|A sustained muscular contraction produced by the passage of a galvanic current.|The galvanotonus caused the frog's leg to twitch.|Near synonyms: spasm, contraction, convulsion|Antonyms: relaxation, flaccidity|noun

Etymology: From *galvano-* (relating to galvanic electricity) + *-tonus* (tension, tone).  Ultimately from Luigi Galvani, Italian physician and physicist, + Greek *tonos*.
