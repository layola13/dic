词源:  "banging" as an adjective meaning "excellent" is relatively recent slang, likely originating in British urban culture.  Its etymology is unclear, but it may be related to the impact or excitement associated with a loud bang.  The noun and more traditional adjectival uses relating to hitting or striking are much older and come from the verb "bang," which has its origins in imitative words for a loud noise.
