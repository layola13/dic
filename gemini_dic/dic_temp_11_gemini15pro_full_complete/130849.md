Etymology:  From non- + approachable + -ity.  "Approachable" comes from the verb "approach," ultimately from the Old French "aprochier," meaning "to come near."  The prefix "non-" negates the meaning, resulting in "nonapproachable," meaning "not able to be approached."  The suffix "-ity" transforms the adjective into the noun "nonapproachability."
