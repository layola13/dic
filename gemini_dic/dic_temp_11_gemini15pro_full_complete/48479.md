词源:  This term originated in nautical slang, referring to the practice of disposing of something by throwing it overboard into water at least six fathoms (36 feet) deep, effectively burying it at sea.  "Six" refers to the depth in fathoms.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any form of complete disposal or abandonment.
