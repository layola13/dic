词源:

"Nonflakiest" is derived from "flaky," which originally referred to something literally flaking or peeling off, like paint or pastry.  The figurative meaning of "flaky" as unreliable or eccentric emerged later.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," so "nonflaky" means "not flaky," and "nonflakiest" is the superlative form, meaning "least flaky."
