ophiomorphite:/ˌɒfiəˈmɔːrfaɪt/| n. |蛇形石|A trace fossil consisting of a burrow or tunnel system with a distinctive knobby or beaded surface, typically found in marine sediments and believed to have been made by crustaceans.|Example 1: The geologists found ophiomorphites in the sandstone, indicating a shallow marine environment.  地质学家在砂岩中发现了蛇形石，表明这是一个浅海环境。

Example 2: The ophiomorphites preserved in the rock formation offer clues about the ancient seafloor.  保存在岩层中的蛇形石为了解古代海底提供了线索。|Synonym: Thalassinoides (sometimes used interchangeably, but technically a different type of trace fossil)|Antonym:  (No direct antonym for a specific trace fossil. Could use terms like "body fossil" to contrast with "trace fossil")|noun
