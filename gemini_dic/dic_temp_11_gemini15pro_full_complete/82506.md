词源：From Middle English *gripen, from Old English *grīpan (“to seize, grip”), from Proto-Germanic *grīpaną (“to grip”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰreyp- (“to seize”).  The sense of "afflict with colic" arose from the notion of being seized with pain.  The sense of "complain" is a figurative extension of this.
