nonfissilities:/ˌnɑːnfɪˈsɪlətiz/ | n. | 非裂变性；非裂变材料 | The treaty addressed the control and monitoring of nonfissile materials. 该条约涉及对非裂变材料的控制和监测。|  The disposal of nonfissilities presents fewer challenges than fissile materials. 非裂变材料的处置比裂变材料的处置挑战更少。 | 近义词: non-fissionable materials | 反义词: fissile materials | 词性: 名词

nonfissile:/ˌnɑːnˈfɪsɪl/ | adj. | 非裂变的 | Uranium-238 is a nonfissile isotope. 铀-238是一种非裂变同位素。|  Nonfissile materials are not capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction. 非裂变材料不能维持核链式反应。 | 近义词: non-fissionable | 反义词: fissile | 词性: 形容词

词源:  "non-" (not) + "fissile" (capable of undergoing fission).  "Fissile" comes from the Latin "fissilis" (that can be split), from "findere" (to split).
