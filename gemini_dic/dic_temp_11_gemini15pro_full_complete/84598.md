The word "hamrov" is not a recognized word in standard English. It doesn't appear in any major dictionaries or corpora. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or even a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, or what you believe its intended meaning to be, I may be able to offer some further speculation.


However, I can demonstrate the requested format with a common word, "what":

what: /wʌt/ /hwʌt/ |pron. determiner, adv.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: N/A (Not applicable for question words) | part of speech: pronoun, determiner, adverb
