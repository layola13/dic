ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ēarwicga, from ēare "ear" + wicga "insect, beetle."  The belief that earwigs crawl into ears is a widespread superstition with no basis in fact.  The name might derive from the insect's cerci, which resemble ear picks, or from the shape of its folded wings, which resemble a human ear.
