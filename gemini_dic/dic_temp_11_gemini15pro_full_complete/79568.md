ETYMOLOGY->
gloom (n.) from Old English *glom, "twilight," from Proto-Germanic *glemaz.  Sense of "darkness, obscurity" is from c. 1200. Figurative meaning "sadness, dejection" is by 1590s.
doom (n.) from Old English dom "judgment, statute, law; condition, status; sentence, condemnation," from Proto-Germanic *domaz (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian dom "judgment," Old Norse domr "doom, judgment," Dutch doem, German Doom "cathedral"), from PIE root *dhe- "to set, put."  Sense of "fate, destiny" developed in Middle English, as did that of "ruin, destruction."
-er (suffix) forms agent nouns, from Old English -ere, from Proto-Germanic *-arja-.
