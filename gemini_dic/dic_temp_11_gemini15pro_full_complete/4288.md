Etymology:
air + worthy + -est

air (n.) Old English *ær (only in compounds), from Proto-Germanic *aira- "air" (source also of Old Norse, Old Frisian, Middle Dutch aar, Dutch, German Luft), perhaps from PIE root *aw- (1) "to blow, breathe."

worthy (adj.) Old English weorð, wurð "of value, worth; deserving; honorable, noble," from Proto-Germanic *wertha- (source also of Old Saxon werd, Old Norse verðr, Old Frisian werd, Old High German werd, German wert "worth," Gothic wairþs "worthy"), from PIE *wert- "to turn, wind," hence "to be, exist."

-est (suffix) Old English -est, superlative suffix, from Proto-Germanic *-ista- (source also of Old Frisian -est, Old Saxon -ost, Old High German -ist, Old Norse -str, Gothic -ists), from PIE *-isto-.
