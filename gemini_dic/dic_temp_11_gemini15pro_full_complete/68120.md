PHRASE-> (Not applicable to "faggot" in either sense.  It doesn't form common phrases.  Listing phrases related to firewood or LGBT issues would be misleading and inappropriate in this context.)

注意事项:  The primary meaning of "faggot" as a bundle of sticks is now archaic.  Its overwhelmingly prevalent usage is as a deeply offensive slur against gay men.  Use with extreme caution and awareness of its harmful connotations.  Avoid using this term whenever possible.
