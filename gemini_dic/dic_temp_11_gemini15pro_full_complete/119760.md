PHRASE-> (mies is not commonly used in phrases.  These examples demonstrate grammatical correctness but are not natural English usage.)
between mies = 在我们之间 (More naturally: between us)
without mies = 没有我们 (More naturally: without us)
for mies = 为了我们 (More naturally: for us)
against mies = 反对我们 (More naturally: against us)
to mies = 对我们 (More naturally: to us)



注意事项:

"Mies" is an archaic form, rarely if ever used in modern English.  "Us" is the standard objective form of "we". While grammatically correct in the examples above, using "mies" in modern conversation would sound unnatural and be confusing to native speakers.  It is strongly recommended to use "us" instead.
