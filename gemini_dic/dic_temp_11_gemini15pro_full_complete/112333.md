词源:  Likely a combination of "lore" (knowledge, especially of a traditional or popular nature) and "man."  While "lore" suggests knowledge, in this context, it ironically implies a *lack* of knowledge about one's location or direction.  The suffix "-man" forms a noun denoting a person associated with the preceding element.  This word is not commonly used and may be considered archaic or dialectal.
