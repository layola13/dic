词源:  The term "dog-legging" originates from the resemblance of the deflected wellbore to a dog's hind leg, which has a sharp bend.  "Dog-leg" itself is attested from the late 18th century, referring to a sharp bend or angle, like that of a dog's leg.  The verbal and nominalized "-ing" forms developed naturally from this original sense.
