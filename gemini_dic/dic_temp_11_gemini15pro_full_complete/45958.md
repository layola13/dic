It is used to measure the flow of water in rivers, streams, and canals.|The dam releases water at a rate of 500 cwms. 大坝以每秒500立方米的速度泄洪。|近义词:cumecs|反义词: N/A|词性:名词

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The river typically flows at 100 cwms. 这条河通常以每秒100立方米的流量流动。
The average flow rate is 250 cwms. 平均流量为每秒250立方米。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The river is currently flowing at 300 cwms due to heavy rain. 由于暴雨，这条河目前的流量为每秒300立方米。
The water level is rising, and the flow rate is increasing to 400 cwms. 水位正在上升，流量正在增加到每秒400立方米。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The river has flowed at over 500 cwms this month. 这个月这条河的流量已超过每秒500立方米。
The dam has released a large volume of water, resulting in a flow rate of 600 cwms. 大坝泄洪了大量的水，导致流量达到每秒600立方米。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The river has been flowing at a high rate of 700 cwms for several days. 这条河已经以每秒700立方米的高流量流动了几天。
The authorities have been monitoring the flow rate, which has been consistently above 800 cwms. 当局一直在监测流量，流量一直保持在每秒800立方米以上。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Last year, the river flowed at an average of 150 cwms. 去年，这条河的平均流量为每秒150立方米。
During the flood, the flow rate reached 900 cwms. 在洪水期间，流量达到了每秒900立方米。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The river was flowing at 200 cwms when the dam was opened. 开闸时，河的流量为每秒200立方米。
The water level was rising rapidly, and the flow rate was increasing to 250 cwms. 水位迅速上升，流量增加到每秒250立方米。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before the dam was built, the river had flowed at a much lower rate. 在大坝建成之前，这条河的流量要低得多。
The flow rate had reached 300 cwms before the rain stopped. 在雨停之前，流量已达到每秒300立方米。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The river had been flowing at a steady rate of 100 cwms for several weeks before the storm. 在暴风雨来临前的几个星期里，这条河一直以每秒100立方米的稳定流量流动。
They had been monitoring the flow rate for days, which had been consistently increasing. 他们已经监测了流量好几天，流量一直在持续增加。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The river will flow at a higher rate during the rainy season. 在雨季，这条河的流量将会更大。
The dam will release more water, increasing the flow rate to 400 cwms. 大坝将释放更多的水，使流量增加到每秒400立方米。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Next week, the river will be flowing at a rate of approximately 500 cwms. 下周，这条河的流量将约为每秒500立方米。
The engineers will be monitoring the flow rate closely. 工程师们将密切监测流量。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the year, the average flow rate will have reached 600 cwms. 到年底，平均流量将达到每秒600立方米。
The dam will have released a significant amount of water by then. 到那时，大坝将已经释放了大量的水。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next summer, the river will have been flowing at a high rate for several months. 到明年夏天，这条河将已经高流量流动了几个月。
The researchers will have been studying the flow rate for several years. 到那时，研究人员将已经研究了流量好几年。
