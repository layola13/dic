注意事项:

"Minum" is primarily used in Indonesian/Malay.  The provided examples reflect usage within that context.  While the verb form can be directly translated to "drink," attempting to force Indonesian grammar onto English usage will sound unnatural.  The noun form is less common in English and usually requires more context.  For example, one might say "I'd like to buy a minum" in Indonesian, but in English, it would be more natural to say "I'd like to buy a drink" or specify the beverage, such as "I'd like to buy a juice."
