ablative:/ˈæblətɪv/ /əˈbleɪtɪv/
noun
夺格，离格
(in some languages) a grammatical case indicating separation or motion away from something, instrumentality, or cause.
Latin uses the ablative case to express various meanings, including separation and instrument. 拉丁语使用夺格来表达各种含义，包括分离和工具。

Etymology:
From Latin *ablātīvus*, from ablātus (past participle of auferre ‘take away’), from ab- ‘away from’ + lātus ‘carried’, from the verb ferre ‘to carry’. 源于拉丁语 *ablātīvus*，来自 ablātus（auferre“带走”的过去分词），来自 ab-“远离”+ lātus“携带”，来自动词 ferre“携带”。


近义词:
(adjective) erosive, corrosive
(noun)  dative, genitive (grammatically related cases)

反义词:
No direct antonym exists, especially for the grammatical sense.  Consider "additive" as a conceptual opposite for the adjective form in some contexts.
