osteomere:/ˈɒstiəˌmɪə(r)/ | n. | 骨节 |A segment of a long bone ossifying from a single centre.  A region of bone between adjacent growth plates.  Essentially, a unit of a long bone. | The growth and fusion of the osteomeres contribute to the overall lengthening of the bone. | synonym: bone segment | antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider "whole bone" conceptually) | noun
