catalyzed:/ˈkætəlaɪzd/| v. |催化的；被催化的|Caused or accelerated by a catalyst.  A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change.|The reaction was catalyzed by an enzyme.|近义词：accelerated, facilitated, promoted, sped up|反义词:inhibited, retarded, slowed down|词性:Verb (past participle)


Etymology: From the noun catalyst + -ize (suffix forming verbs meaning "to cause to be," "to become," "to treat with," etc.). Catalyst ultimately comes from the Greek word katalysis, meaning "dissolution."
