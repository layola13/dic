PHRASE->
This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  It's generally used descriptively within a sentence.  Since it's an adverb formed by the prefix "non-" and the adjective "feverish," phrases wouldn't naturally form around it the same way they do with core words.  Therefore, providing examples of phrases with "nonfeverishly" would be forced and unnatural.
