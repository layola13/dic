ETYMOLOGY->
From gorge (verb) + -able.  "Gorge" comes from the Old French "gorger," meaning "throat," and ultimately from the Latin "gurges," meaning "whirlpool."  The original sense of "gorge" was to fill the throat or cram with food.  Thus, "gorgeable" initially meant "capable of being gorged upon," but evolved to mean "delightful" or "pleasing to the senses."
