词源:  "nonsatiricalnesses" is derived from "satirical," which comes from the Latin "satiricus" and ultimately from the Greek "satyrikos," relating to satyrs, mythical creatures associated with revelry and satire.  The prefix "non-" negates the meaning, and the suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "nonsatirical" into a noun.  


注意事项： "nonsatiricalnesses" is not a commonly used word.  While grammatically correct,  "nonsatiricalness" (singular) is more frequently used, or simply phrasing the concept differently, such as "lack of satire" or "seriousness."
