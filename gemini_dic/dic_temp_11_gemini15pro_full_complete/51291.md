ETYMOLOGY->
From detachedness + -'s (possessive suffix).  Detachedness comes from detached + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality). Detached comes from the Old French "destacher" meaning to unfasten, detach, which itself comes from "des-" (apart) + "attacher" (to attach).  Ultimately, the roots trace back to Latin.
