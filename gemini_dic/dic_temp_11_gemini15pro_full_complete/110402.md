词源:
"liit" is a slang spelling of "elite," ultimately deriving from the French "élite," meaning "chosen" or "select." The spelling "liit" likely originated in online gaming culture, potentially influenced by the similar slang term "leet" (from "elite"), which uses numerical substitutions for letters.  The doubled "i" may emphasize the ironic or exaggerated nature of the term.
