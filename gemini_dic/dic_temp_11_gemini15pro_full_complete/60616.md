elderlies: /ˈeldərliz/ | n. | 老年人（非正式，不推荐使用） |  This word is generally considered informal and somewhat awkward. It's better to use "elderly people," "senior citizens," or simply "elders."  It's formed by adding "-es" to "elderly," which is already a collective noun referring to older people.  | We should respect the elderlies. (Better: We should respect elderly people.) 我们应该尊重老年人。 | The elderlies in the community enjoy the activities at the senior center. (Better: The elderly people in the community enjoy the activities at the senior center.) 社区里的老年人喜欢老年活动中心里的活动。 | 近义词：elderly people, senior citizens, elders | 反义词: youngsters, children, youth | 词性: 名词

词源:  From "elderly" + "-es." "Elderly" comes from "elder" (meaning older) + "-ly" (forming an adjective).  "Elder" ultimately comes from Old English "ieldra," comparative of "eald" (old).
