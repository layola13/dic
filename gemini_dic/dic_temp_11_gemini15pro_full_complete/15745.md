Etymology: From Old English *bealdor (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *baldiz, from Proto-Indo-European *bʰel- (“white, shining”). Cognate with Old High German balt (“bold, brave, white, shining”), Old Norse ballr (“white, shining”). The semantic shift from "shining" to "bald" likely occurred through association with a gleaming, hairless head.
