Etymology: From curl + -ed + -ness.  "Curl" comes from Middle English *curle, probably from Old Norse *krullr, meaning "bent," related to Old English crul "curly."  The suffix "-ed" forms the past participle of verbs, and when added to nouns, it creates an adjective meaning "having the quality of." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
