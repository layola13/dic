equifinality:/ˌiːkwɪfaɪˈnælɪti/
n.
均终性；等终性；同终性
The principle that in open systems, a given end state can be reached by many potential means.  A system can reach the same final state from differing initial conditions and by a variety of paths.
The concept of equifinality suggests that multiple paths can lead to the same outcome.  均终性概念表明，多条路径可以导致相同的结果。

Different combinations of therapy can lead to equifinality in terms of symptom reduction. 不同的治疗组合可以在症状减轻方面达到均终性。

近义词：convergence, multifinality (in some contexts, as it highlights the opposite principle)
反义词：unilinearity, determinism
词性：noun
