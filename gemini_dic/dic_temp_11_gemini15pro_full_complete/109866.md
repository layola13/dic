lga:/ˌɛlˌdʒiˈeɪ/
n.
Land Grid Array（陆地栅格阵列）
A type of integrated circuit packaging that uses a grid of contacts on the underside of the package, rather than pins around the perimeter. This allows for a higher density of connections and better thermal performance.
The new processor uses an LGA 1700 socket. 新处理器使用LGA 1700插座。
近义词:BGA (Ball Grid Array)
反义词:PGA (Pin Grid Array)
