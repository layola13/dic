nitroquinol:/ˌnaɪtrəˈkwɪnɒl/ /ˌnaɪtroʊˈkwɪnɑːl/ | n. |硝基喹啉|A chemical compound that is a potent carcinogen, often used in cancer research to induce tumors in experimental animals.  It is a quinoline derivative with a nitro group attached. |Nitroquinol was used in the study to induce skin tumors in mice.  硝基喹啉被用于研究中以诱导小鼠皮肤肿瘤。 |Synonyms: 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, 4NQO |Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific chemical compound.  One could consider "anti-carcinogen" in a broader sense.)| noun
