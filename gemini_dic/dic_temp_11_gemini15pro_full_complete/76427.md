词源: From Japanese 外行 (gaikō), from 外 (gai, “outside”) + 行 (kō, “profession, business”).  "Gai" meaning outside and "kou/gyou" meaning occupation/profession/business/industry.


注意事项:  "Gaiki" is a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in contexts related to Japanese culture or by those familiar with the Japanese language.  While synonyms like "amateur" or "novice" are more common in English, "gaiki" carries a slightly stronger connotation of being completely out of one's depth or lacking even basic knowledge.
