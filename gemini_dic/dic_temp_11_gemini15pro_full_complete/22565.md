词源: "Bootboy" originated in the 1960s in England, referring to young men who wore distinctive styles of boots, often Doc Martens, as part of their subculture. This subculture was often associated with specific music genres like ska and soul and later became linked to football hooliganism.  The term combines "boot" (referring to the footwear) and "boy" (indicating the age and gender of the individuals).
