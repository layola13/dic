mesocoracoid:/ˌmɛzoʊˈkɔːrəkɔɪd/
noun
中乌喙骨; 内乌喙骨
A bony or cartilaginous process projecting from the scapula of birds and some other vertebrates, situated near the glenoid cavity and often fused with the coracoid.  It provides additional support for the shoulder joint and assists in flight or other forms of locomotion.
The mesocoracoid is a prominent feature in avian skeletons. 中乌喙骨是鸟类骨骼的一个显著特征。
Fossil evidence suggests the presence of a mesocoracoid in some theropod dinosaurs. 化石证据表明某些兽脚类恐龙存在中乌喙骨。
synonym:  coracoid process (in some contexts)
antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical feature)
n.
