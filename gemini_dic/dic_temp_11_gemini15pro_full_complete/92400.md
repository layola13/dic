hypodicrotic:/ˌhaɪpəʊdaɪˈkrɒtɪk/
adjective
低切迹脉的
Relating to or characterized by a hypodicrotic pulse, where a small notch or wave appears on the descending part of a pulse tracing, typically after the dicrotic notch.
A hypodicrotic pulse is rarely seen and can be indicative of certain heart conditions.  Further investigation is required if detected.
近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it's a specific medical term.  Potentially "abnormal pulse" or "irregular pulse" could be used in a general sense, but they are not medically equivalent.)
反义词: (No direct antonym. A "normal pulse" or "regular pulse" would be contrasted, but not a true opposite.)
