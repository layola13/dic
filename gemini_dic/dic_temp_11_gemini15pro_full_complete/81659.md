词源：
"Green" refers to environmentalism and sustainability. "Collar" traditionally refers to the type of work someone does, as in "blue-collar" (manual labor) and "white-collar" (office/administrative work). "Green-collar" combines these concepts to represent work related to environmental protection and sustainability.
