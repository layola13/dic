ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + deprecating.  "Deprecating" comes from the Latin "deprecatus," past participle of "deprecari," meaning "to pray against" or "to avert by prayer."  Over time, it evolved to mean "to express disapproval of" and then "to belittle."  Therefore, "nondeprecating" signifies the absence of this belittling or self-disparaging quality.
