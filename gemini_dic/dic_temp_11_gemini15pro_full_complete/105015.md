The word "kentu" isn't a recognized English word.  It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.

If you meant "can't do" (cannot do), then a breakdown is possible, but it's analyzed as two separate words: "can" and "do."

can:/kæn/ | v. aux. |能, 可以, 会| To be able to; have the skill, power, or opportunity to do something. |例句：I can swim. 我会游泳。|例句：She can speak French. 她会说法语。 | 近义词:able, capable | 反义词:unable, incapable | 词性: auxiliary verb (助动词)

do:/duː/ | v. aux. v. |做, 行动, 表现 |To perform an action, activity, or task. | 例句：I do my homework every day. 我每天都做作业。 | 例句：They do their best. 他们尽力而为。 | 近义词:perform, execute, act | 反义词: (No single direct antonym, depends on context) | 词性: verb (动词), auxiliary verb (助动词)
