注意事项:

"Buibui" is not a formally recognized English word, but rather an informal or childish term.  It likely originated through reduplication (repeating a syllable to create a new word).  It has no real etymology in the same way a standard English word would.  It's primarily used in Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.
