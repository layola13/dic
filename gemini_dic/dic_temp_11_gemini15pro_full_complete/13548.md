The word "attemptate" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a misspelling or a neologism perhaps intended to mean something like "attempt to assassinate". Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. However, I can analyze the word "attempt" and the suffix "-ate" which might be where this non-standard word originates from.  And I'll analyze "assassinate" as well, given the possible intended meaning.
