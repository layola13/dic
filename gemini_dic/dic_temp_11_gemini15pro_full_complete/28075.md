"capian" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language.  If you could provide more context, such as the language it might be from or the context in which you encountered it, I can try to help further.  Since I can't analyze "capian," I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "question."
