##pacinian /ˈpæsɪniən/ | adj. |  帕西尼氏的；帕氏体的 |  Relating to or denoting Pacinian corpuscles. | Pacinian corpuscles are sensitive to vibration and pressure. 帕西尼氏小体对振动和压力敏感。 |None provided (specific anatomical term) | None provided (specific anatomical term) | adj.ian" is derived from the name of Filippo Pacini (1812-1883), an Italian anatomist and pathologist.  He was the first to comprehensively describe these sensory receptors in 1840, thoughtheir function wasn't fully understood until later.  The term is an adjectival form,  created by adding "-ian" (indicating connection or belonging to) to his name. Thus, "pacinian" directlyattributes the descriptor to Pacini's discovery.specialized type of nerve ending.  You won't find it used in everyday conversation.and viscera. They are responsible for detecting vibrations and deep pressure.  Their distinctive layered structure is crucial to their function—the layers act as a mechanical filter, allowing them to respond efficiently to rapidly changing stimuli but less so to sustained pressure.largely surround the structure, function, and distribution of Pacinian corpuscles. You might encounter "pacinian" in anatomical descriptions, research studies on sensory perception, discussions on the neural pathways of touch, explanations of how we perceive vibrations, or even in research papers relating to prosthetics and sensory feedback.(Examples):**acinian corpuscles** in the fingertips." (研究人员使用先进的成像技术来观察指尖帕西尼氏小体的详细结构。), one could use descriptive terms like "lamellated corpuscle" (referring to its layered structure) or "vibration-sensitive receptor"  to indicate similar function, but these are not perfect replacements.acinian."  The concept of an antonym would require a contrasting type of receptor serving an opposite function which isn't a straightforward concept in this biological context.
