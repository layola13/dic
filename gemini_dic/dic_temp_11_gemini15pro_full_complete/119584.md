microzoospore:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈzoʊəˌspɔːr/ | n. | 微游动孢子 | A motile zoospore of small size, typical of certain fungi and algae. | Example 1: The microzoospores were observed swimming rapidly under the microscope.  显微镜下观察到微游动孢子快速游动。

Example 2: The release of microzoospores is triggered by specific environmental conditions. 微游动孢子的释放是由特定的环境条件触发的。| Synonym: zoospore, swarm spore | Antonym: (No direct antonym, perhaps consider non-motile spore or aplanospore) | Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From micro- + zoo- + spore.  "Micro-" comes from Greek "mikros" meaning "small." "Zoo-" comes from Greek "zōion" meaning "animal." "Spore" comes from Greek "spora" meaning "seed."
