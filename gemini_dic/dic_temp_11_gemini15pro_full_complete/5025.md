词源: The phrase likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century, drawing on the physical sensations of heat and agitation associated with stress and anxiety.  "Bothered" itself comes from the Old English word "boðian," meaning "to proclaim, announce," later evolving to mean "to trouble, annoy."  The "hot" element intensifies the sense of discomfort and agitation.
