ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cenatio, from Latin cena (“dinner, supper”), from Proto-Italic *kenā (“dinner”), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰḱen- (“to eat”).  The connection to "dinner" likely comes from the tradition of combining meals with entertainment.  Over time, the word shifted to refer primarily to the entertainment itself, particularly dramatic performances.
