ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + phrase (to express in words).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, astray," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", from Proto-Indo-European "*mei- (1)" (to change, go, move). "Phrase" comes from Late Middle English: from Old French, from Latin phrasis, from Greek phrasis ‘diction, style’, from phrazein ‘tell’.
