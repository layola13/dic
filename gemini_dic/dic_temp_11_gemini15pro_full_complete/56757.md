The word "doos" isn't a standard English word.  It's likely a slang term, a misspelling, or a word from another language.  Since there's no official entry for it, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you're thinking of "dos" (as in MS-DOS or Spanish for "two"), or perhaps another similar-sounding word, please provide it and I can give you a full breakdown.

Since I can't analyze "doos," I'll provide the requested analysis for "what," a common English word that often causes confusion for learners due to its many uses:

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
