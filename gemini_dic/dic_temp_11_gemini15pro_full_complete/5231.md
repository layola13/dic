注意事项:  Although "allly" is listed in some dictionaries, it is not a commonly used word, especially in modern English. "Completely," "totally," "entirely," and "fully" are much more frequent and natural choices.  Using "allly" might sound archaic or dialectal.  The adjective form is even less common.  Be cautious when using this word.
