The word "norice" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's a very niche technical term, slang, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, what it seemed to refer to), I can try to provide more information.

Since I can't analyze "norice," I'll analyze the similar-sounding word **"notice"**:

notice: /ˈnəʊtɪs/ | n. vt.| 注意，通知，布告；注意到 |  A written or spoken announcement.  He received a notice to vacate the premises. 他收到了搬离该处所的通知。 | synonyms: announcement, notification, warning, observation | antonyms: ignorance, disregard | noun, verb

notice: /ˈnəʊtɪs/ | vt.| 注意到，察觉 | To become aware of something.  I noticed a change in her behavior. 我注意到她的行为有所改变。 | synonyms: observe, perceive, detect, spot | antonyms: overlook, miss, ignore | verb
