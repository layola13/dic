词源：From Old English *blīhtan, from Proto-Germanic *blīhtijaną (“to make pale”), from *blīhtaz (“pale, shining”). Cognate with Dutch bleken (“to bleach”), German bleichen (“to bleach”).  The original meaning referred to making something pale, as a plant affected by disease.  The sense of "damaging or destroying" developed later.
