lipoproteins:/ˌlɪpoʊˈproʊtiːnz/, /ˌlɪpəʊˈprəʊtiːnz/ | n. | 脂蛋白 |  Biologically occurring complexes of lipids and proteins that transport lipids in the blood.  They are classified according to their density. | High levels of low-density lipoproteins are associated with heart disease. 高密度脂蛋白与心脏病相关。 | synonyms:  lipid-protein complex | antonyms:  None (This is a biochemical entity, not typically having direct antonyms.) | noun

lipoprotein:/ˌlɪpoʊˈproʊtiːn/, /ˌlɪpəʊˈprəʊtiːnz/ | n. | 脂蛋白 | A biochemical assembly consisting of both lipids (fats) and proteins. These complexes transport fats throughout the body in the bloodstream. Different types of lipoproteins have varying densities and compositions, affecting their roles in lipid metabolism. |  Regular exercise can increase high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which is beneficial for cardiovascular health.  规律的运动可以增加高密度脂蛋白 (HDL)，这对心血管健康有益。 | synonyms:  lipid-protein complex | antonyms: None | noun
