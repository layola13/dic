lewdest:/ˈluːdɪst/| adj.|最淫荡的，最下流的|Superlative form of lewd: given to or intended for excessive indulgence in sexual activity.|His lewdest jokes were saved for his closest friends. 他最下流的笑话只讲给他最亲密的朋友听。|近义词：most obscene, most vulgar, most indecent, most lascivious|反义词：purest, chastest, most virtuous|词性:形容词

Etymology:
From Middle English *lewedest*, superlative of *lewed* (“lay, unlearned, ignorant, vulgar, vile”), from Old English *læwede* (“lay, not of the clergy; ignorant, unlearned”), from Proto-Germanic *lawwiz* (“layman”), from Proto-Indo-European *lewh-* (“to leave behind, to separate”).  The semantic shift from "ignorant" to "vulgar" and then to "sexually suggestive" occurred over time, likely due to association with the perceived lower morals of the uneducated populace.
