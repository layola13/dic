nonrelieving
词源:non- (prefix meaning "not") + relieving (present participle of relieve, meaning "to alleviate or reduce pain or distress")
The word "relieve" comes from the Old French "relevier," which in turn comes from the Latin "relevare," meaning "to lift up, lighten." The prefix "non-" simply negates the meaning of "relieving."
