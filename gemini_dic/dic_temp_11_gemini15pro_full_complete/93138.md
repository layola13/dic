注意事项:
Since "Igbos" primarily refers to a group of people (or their language), using it in some tenses can sound unnatural.  For example, "The Igbos are being celebrated" sounds less natural than "Igbo culture is being celebrated." Consider rephrasing sentences focusing on Igbo culture or people when certain tenses feel awkward.
