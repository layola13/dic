注意事项:
"flys" as a verb is a non-standard spelling. The standard spelling of the third-person singular present tense form of "fly" is "flies."  "Flys" as a noun, representing the plural of "fly" (insect), is also non-standard.  While sometimes used informally, the correct plural is "flies."  This analysis accommodates both potential (though non-standard) interpretations.
