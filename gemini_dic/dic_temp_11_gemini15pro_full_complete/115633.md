词源:  From "march" (n. & v.) + "-like" (suffix). "March" comes from Old French "marcher" (to walk, to tread), ultimately from Frankish "*markōn" (horse), related to Old High German "marah" (horse) and Proto-Germanic "*markhaz".  "-like" is a native English suffix meaning "resembling" or "characteristic of".
