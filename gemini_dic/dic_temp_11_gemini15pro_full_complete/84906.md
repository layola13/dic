noun
手帕（hankie的名词所有格）
A hankie is a small piece of cloth, typically cotton or linen, used for wiping one's nose or eyes.  Hankie's indicates possession, belonging to a hankie.

It's more common to see "my hankie," "her hankie," etc.
Example: The lace on the hankie's edge was delicate. 手帕边缘的蕾丝很精致。
Synonym: handkerchief's
