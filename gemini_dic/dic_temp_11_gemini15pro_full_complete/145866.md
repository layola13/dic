词源:  "Overderisivenesses" is derived from "deride," which comes from the Latin "deridere," meaning "to laugh down" or "to mock."  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning, indicating an excessive degree of derision.  The suffix "-ness" turns the verb "deride" into the noun "derisiveness," which refers to the state or quality of being derisive. Finally, the suffix "-es" makes the noun plural, indicating multiple instances of this state or quality.
