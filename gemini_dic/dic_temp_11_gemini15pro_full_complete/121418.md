词源:
"Misinfer" comes from the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") and the verb "infer" (meaning "deduce or conclude (information) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements."). The word "infer" itself comes from the Latin "inferre," meaning "to bring in, carry in; introduce, allege, conclude, infer."
