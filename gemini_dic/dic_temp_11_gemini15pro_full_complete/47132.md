The word "dauw" appears to be Dutch.  There's no direct English equivalent with the same breadth of meaning.  It's most closely related to "dew," but can also encompass related concepts like mist, moisture, and a fresh, early morning feeling.

注意事项:

The word "dauw" is primarily used in Dutch, not English.  The English "dew" is the closest equivalent.

Many of the continuous tenses feel less natural with "dauw" as it describes a state rather than a continuous action.  Rephrasing with related verbs like "evaporate," "form," or "cover" often sounds more natural.
