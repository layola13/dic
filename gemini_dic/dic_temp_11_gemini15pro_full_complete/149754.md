The further addition of "-s" creates the plural form, indicating multiple palatal sounds.It's used to describe a class of consonant sounds articulated with the tongue against or near the hard palate. The exact placement of the tongue can vary slightly depending on the specific palatal sound.  For example, /j/ (as in "yes") is a palatal approximant, meaning the tongue comesclose to the palate but doesn't create a complete closure.  /ʃ/ (as in "ship") is a palatal fricative, where the tongue creates a narrow passage for air to flow through, producing friction.crucial for understanding the sound systems of various languages.
