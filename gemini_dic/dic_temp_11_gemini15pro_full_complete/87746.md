注意事项:

词源： "Heian" (平安) is a Japanese word referring to a period of Japanese history (794-1185).  In karate, the term "heyen" (pronounced similarly but written differently in Japanese) refers to kata (forms) named after this period, representing peace and tranquility.  These kata emphasize stability, balance, and controlled movement.  The pronunciation has shifted to "heyen" in English.
