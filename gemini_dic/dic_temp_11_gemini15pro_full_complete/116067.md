ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *martengale*, possibly from Old Provençal *martegalo*, meaning "inhabitant of Martigues".  The town of Martigues in Provence, France, was known for its unusual trousers.  The term then came to refer to a variety of items, including the horse harness and the gambling system, possibly due to perceived associations with strangeness or unpredictability.
