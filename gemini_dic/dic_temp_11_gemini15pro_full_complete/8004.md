The word "anthorism" doesn't appear to be a valid English word. It's likely a misspelling of "authorism" which itself is not a standard word.  The closest recognized words are "authoritarianism" and "authoritative."  I will provide analyses for both.

**Authoritarianism:**

/əˌθɔːrɪˈtɛːrɪənɪzəm/ | n. | 独裁主义，专制主义 | A political system characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms.  It emphasizes obedience to authority at the expense of individual liberty. | Example 1: The country suffered under the grip of authoritarianism for decades.  这个国家在独裁主义的统治下受苦了几十年。

Example 2:  Historians debate the causes of the rise of authoritarianism in the 20th century.  历史学家们争论20世纪独裁主义兴起的原因。 | Synonyms: despotism, dictatorship, tyranny | Antonyms: democracy, liberalism, freedom | Noun

**Authoritative:**

/əˈθɔːrɪtətɪv/ | adj. | 权威的；命令式的；可信的 |  1. Able to be trusted as being accurate or true; reliable. 2.  Commanding and self-confident; likely to be respected and obeyed. | Example 1:  The doctor gave an authoritative opinion on the patient's condition. 医生就病人的病情给出了权威的意见。

Example 2: She spoke in an authoritative tone that demanded respect. 她用一种权威的语气说话，要求得到尊重。 | Synonyms: reliable, definitive, commanding, assertive | Antonyms: unreliable, hesitant, submissive, uncertain | Adjective


**Etymology of Authoritarianism:**

From *authority* (from Old French *autorite*, from Latin *auctoritas*, from *auctor* 'author, originator') + *-arian* (denoting advocacy of a particular belief system) + *-ism* (denoting a doctrine, belief, or practice).


**Etymology of Authoritative:**

From Late Latin *authoritativus*, from Latin *auctoritas* 'authority' (see above) + *-ive* (forming adjectives meaning 'tending to' or 'having the nature of').
