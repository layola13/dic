Therefore, "plea bargain" literally describes anegotiation surrounding a legal pleading..  The specifics of plea bargaining agreements vary by jurisdiction, but common elements include reduced charges, sentencing recommendations by the prosecution, and the dropping of some charges in exchange for a guilty plea on others.  The judge ultimately retains the power to approve or reject any plea bargain agreement.

The process involves extensive negotiations between the defense attorney, the prosecutor, and often, the defendant themselves.-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter.
