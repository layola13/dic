organophyly:/ɔːrˌɡænəˈfɪli/ | n. | 亲有机性; 有机亲和性 | The tendency of a substance to be readily wetted by organic liquids.  This often implies a corresponding lack of affinity for water (hydrophobicity). |  The organophyly of the coating allows it to adhere strongly to the plastic substrate.  这种涂层的亲有机性使其能够牢固地粘附在塑料基材上。 |  lipophilicity, hydrophobicity | hydrophilicity | noun
