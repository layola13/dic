PHRASE->
(Begorra is typically used as a stand-alone interjection and doesn't form set phrases in the same way other words do. It's more about the way it's used for emphasis or light-hearted surprise.)  However, one could imagine constructions like:

"Begorra, and what if I don't?" (哎呀，如果我不呢？)
"Begorra, and what's it to ya?" (哎呀，这和你有什么关系？)  (Note:  This adds a more confrontational tone.)
"Begorra, what a day!" (哎呀，真是美好的一天！)
"Begorra, and that's the truth!" (哎呀，那是真的！)
"Begorra, I'll be..." (哎呀，我会...) (Often followed by an action or statement).

注意事项:
"Begorra" is considered informal and colloquial, primarily associated with Irish dialect.  It's less common in modern usage.
