ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *inviter (modern French inviter), from Latin invitāre "to invite, summon, challenge," frequentative of invītāre "to entertain, treat, feast, summon," from in- "in" + vitāre "to shun, avoid." The sense shift in Latin may be due to the custom of "calling upon" the gods at a feast.
