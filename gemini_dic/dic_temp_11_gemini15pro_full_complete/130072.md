注意事项:
The provided examples demonstrate the usage of non-predicative adjectives across different tenses and sentence structures. However, it's important to remember that the primary function of a non-predicative adjective is to modify a noun directly, regardless of the tense or voice of the verb.  The continuous tenses and perfect tenses are less commonly used with simple non-predicative adjectives because these tenses emphasize the duration or completion of an action, while non-predicative adjectives simply describe a quality of the noun.
