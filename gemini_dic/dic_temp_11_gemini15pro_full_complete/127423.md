Etymology: From Middle English *nete, from Old English *nēat (“cattle, beast; useful animal; property”), from Proto-Germanic *nautą (“cattle, property”), from Proto-Indo-European *newt- (“to be useful, to be of use, to profit”). Related to German Nutztier (“farm animal”), Gothic 𐌽𐌹𐌿𐍄𐌰𐌽 (niutan, “to use, enjoy”), Old Irish néit (“thing, animal”), Latin uti (“to use”), Ancient Greek νέμω (némō, “I distribute, I deal out”). More distantly related to need. The sense development is from "cattle (as possessions)" to "clean and orderly (as befits a good housekeeper)," then to "elegant, simple," then to "undiluted."
