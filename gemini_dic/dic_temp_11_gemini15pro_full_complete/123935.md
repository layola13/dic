morgans:/ˈmɔːrɡənz/| n. |摩根（遗传学单位）|A unit of distance between genes on a chromosome, representing the frequency of crossing-over between them. One morgan corresponds to a recombination frequency of 1%.|The two genes are located 10 morgans apart on the chromosome.|近义词: centimorgan (cM), map unit|反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it's a unit of measurement)|noun
