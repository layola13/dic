Etymology:
From Middle English *crone*, from Old North French *carogne* (“carrion, carcass”), from Late Latin *carōnia* (“carcass, corpse”). Ultimately from Latin *caro, carnis* (“flesh”).  The semantic shift from "carcass" to "old woman" likely occurred through association with the withered appearance of a corpse.
