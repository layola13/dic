注意事项:
"Longly" is an uncommon word and often sounds awkward in modern English.  "Lonely" (adjective) or "loneliness" (noun) are generally preferred. While grammatically correct, its usage might sound archaic or overly formal in many contexts.  Consider using synonyms like "solitarily" for a more natural expression.
