词源:  "crawler's" comes from "crawler" + "'s". "Crawler" originates from the verb "crawl," which comes from Old Norse *krafla, meaning "to scratch, claw."  The suffix "-er" denotes an agent or one who performs the action, turning the verb "crawl" into the noun "crawler," referring to something that crawls.  The "'s" is a possessive marker, indicating ownership or belonging.
