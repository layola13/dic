osmotic:/ɒzˈmɒtɪk/ /ɑːzˈmɑːtɪk/| adj.|渗透的；渗透性的|Relating to osmosis, the process by which a solvent passes through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated one, equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.|例句：The osmotic pressure inside the cell is higher than outside.  细胞内部的渗透压高于外部。|近义词：diffusive, permeable|反义词:impermeable|词性:形容词

osmosis:/ɒzˈməʊsɪs/ /ɑːzˈmoʊsɪs/| n.|渗透；渗透作用|The process by which a solvent passes through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated one, equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.|例句：Osmosis is crucial for the absorption of water by plants. 渗透作用对植物吸收水分至关重要。|近义词：diffusion, permeation|反义词: N/A (Osmosis is a process, not a quality, so it doesn't have a direct antonym)|词性:名词
