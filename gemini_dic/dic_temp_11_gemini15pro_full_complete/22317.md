词源:  The origin of "bonk" in the sense of "hit" is imitative, echoing the sound of a dull thud. The sexual meaning is a more recent development, possibly arising from the idea of bodies hitting together. The sporting usage, meaning "to hit the wall" or become exhausted, likely stems from the sensation of a sudden, debilitating fatigue.
