词源：
From mug +‎ -iness.  "Mug" originally referred to a drinking vessel, but later came to mean "face," perhaps because of the resemblance of a face to the rounded shape of a mug. "Mugginess" initially referred to the flushed, sweaty appearance of a face in hot, humid weather, and later extended to the unpleasant feeling of such weather. The sense of "thuggish appearance" likely arose from the association of a rough, weather-beaten face with criminality.
