microglia: /maɪˈkroʊɡliːə/ /maɪˈkrəʊɡliːə/
| n. | 小胶质细胞 | A type of glial cell that acts as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS).  They are resident macrophage cells, constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged neurons and synapses, and infectious agents. | Microglia play a crucial role in brain development and maintenance. 小胶质细胞在大脑发育和维持中起着至关重要的作用。 | Microglia become activated in response to injury or infection. 小胶质细胞在受伤或感染时会被激活。 | 近义词:  glial cells (广义), macrophages (功能相似) | 反义词:  N/A | 词性: noun


Etymology:
From micro- + -glia, from Greek  μικρός (mikrós, “small”) + γλία (glía, “glue”).
