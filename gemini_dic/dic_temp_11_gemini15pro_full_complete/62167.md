encoder's:/ɪnˈkoʊdərz/ | n. | 编码器 |  The possessive form of "encoder," referring to something that belongs to or is associated with an encoder. An encoder is a device, circuit, transducer, software program, algorithm or person that converts information from one format or code to another, for the purposes of standardization, speed, secrecy, security or saving space. | The encoder's output is a digital signal. 编码器的输出是一个数字信号。|  Synonyms: coder's, programmer's (in some contexts) | Antonyms: decoder's | noun
