词源：
From French *grotesque*, from Italian *grottesco* “cave-like, relating to a grotto,” from *grotta* “cave,” from Late Latin *grupta*, variant of Latin *crypta* “crypt." The connection with grottoes arises from the discovery of ancient Roman wall paintings in grottoes or cave-like rooms during the Renaissance. These paintings often featured fanciful and bizarre decorations.
