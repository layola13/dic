dipolar:/daɪˈpoʊlər/| adj.|偶极的，双极的|Having two poles with opposing properties, such as electric charge or magnetic force.  Relating to or characterized by a dipole or dipoles.|The water molecule is dipolar because it has a positive end and a negative end.|近义词：polar, bipolar|反义词：nonpolar|词性: adjective
Etymology: From di- (two) + -polar (relating to a pole).  Ultimately from Greek *dis* (twice) and *polos* (axis, pole).
