gastraea:/ɡæsˈtriːə/| n. |原腸胚|A hypothetical ancestral metazoan with a single body cavity lined with endoderm, similar to the gastrula stage of embryonic development.  It's a theoretical organism representing a stage in the evolution of multicellular animals.|Haeckel proposed the gastraea as a hypothetical ancestor representing the transition from unicellular to multicellular life. 海克尔提出原腸胚作為一個假設的祖先，代表從單細胞生物到多細胞生物的過渡。|The gastraea theory suggests that all metazoans evolved from a common ancestor resembling a gastrula. 原腸胚理論認為所有後生動物都是從一個類似原腸胚的共同祖先進化而來的。|近义词: gastrula,  blastrula |反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps single-celled organism) |词性: noun
