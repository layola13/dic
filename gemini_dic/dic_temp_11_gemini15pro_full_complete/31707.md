词源:  Derived from "chav," a British slang term for a young person, typically from a working-class background, who is characterized by their casual wear, anti-social behaviour, and perceived lack of education.  "Chavvier" is the comparative form of this adjective.  The etymology of "chav" is uncertain, but one theory suggests it may be derived from the Romani word "chavi," meaning "child."
