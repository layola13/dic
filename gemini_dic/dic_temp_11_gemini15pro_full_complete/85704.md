what haves you. (Archaic/humorous) =  what do you have. 你有什么。
(The most common phrases associated with "have" don't apply to the third-person singular present form "haves" specifically.)



注意事项:

"Haves" is primarily used as the third-person singular present tense form of "have," indicating possession or ownership.  Its use as an auxiliary verb to form the present perfect is grammatically controversial and generally considered incorrect in Standard English.  "Has" should be used instead.  Many of the example sentences using "haves" in various tenses are grammatically incorrect and provided for illustrative purposes only.  The correct form using "has" or other conjugations of "have" should be employed.
