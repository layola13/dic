词源:
The origin of "kitty-cornered" is uncertain, but it is believed to be a corruption of the phrase "cater-cornered."  "Cater" in this context likely comes from the French word "quatre," meaning "four," referring to the four corners of a square or intersection.  Over time, "cater" morphed into "catty" and then "kitty," possibly influenced by the perceived diagonal movement of a cat.
