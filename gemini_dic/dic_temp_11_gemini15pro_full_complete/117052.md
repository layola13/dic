词源： "m" possibly represents "mobile" or "modular" and "core" refers to the central or most important part of something. It's likely a recently coined term related to technology and therefore a precise etymology might be difficult to ascertain without more context. It's not a standard English word like "core" itself. It's probably a specific term used within a particular company or industry.
