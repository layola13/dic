ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fēond (attested only as the plural fēond, "enemies"), from Proto-Germanic *fijandz ("enemy, hater"), from Proto-Indo-European *pi-yont- ("hater").  Cognate with Dutch vijand ("enemy"), German Feind ("enemy"), Old Norse fjandi ("enemy").  The sense of "devil" developed from the use of the word to translate Latin diabolus ("devil," literally "slanderer, accuser") and in the context of "enemy of God."  The sense of "addict" or "enthusiast" developed in the 20th century.
