glop's:/ɡlɑːps/| n.|一团黏糊糊的东西（复数）|A glop is a shapeless, sticky mass of something.  The apostrophe-s indicates the possessive form, meaning "belonging to the glop."

It would most likely refer to a characteristic or part of that mass. |The glop's sticky texture made it hard to remove.  这团黏糊糊的东西的粘性使它很难去除。|近义词：goo, slime, goop|反义词: (No direct antonym exists, perhaps something dry and solid like "powder") |noun
