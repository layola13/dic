PHRASE->
N/A (This word is typically not used in phrases. It's more commonly used as a descriptive verb.)

注意事项:
While "dialogued" is grammatically correct, it's less common than using forms of "to discuss," "to converse," or "to have a dialogue."  For example, instead of saying "The play dialogued the relationship," it's more natural to say "The play explored the relationship through dialogue."
