注意事项:

While "decisionmaking" is a valid word, it is often written as "decision-making" (with a hyphen). The examples above illustrate how using the word as a verb can be awkward.  It's generally better to use clearer verbs like "decide," "make a decision," "consider," "deliberate," "formulate," "develop," etc. depending on the specific context.
