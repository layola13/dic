ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *fesen, from Old English *fēsian (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *fausjaną (“to put in order, arrange”), from Proto-Indo-European *pewə- (“to purify, cleanse”).  Cognate with West Frisian fiesje (“to tidy up”), Dutch vijzen (“to rub, polish”).  More at few. The semantic shift is unclear, but may be related to the idea of being "put out of order" or "disarranged" by annoyance.
