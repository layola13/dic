gault:/ɡɔːlt/| n.|高岭土，蓝灰粘土|A stiff, bluish-gray clay, especially of the Cretaceous period.|The gault is rich in fossils.  这种蓝灰粘土富含化石。|Synonyms: clay, marl|Antonyms: sand, gravel|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Old North French *gaut, from a variant of Old French chalt "lime, mortar," from Latin calx (genitive calcis) "limestone, lime."  The sense evolution likely occurred due to the clay's calcareous nature.
