ETYMOLOGY->

From the verb "crouch" + "-er" (agent suffix).  "Crouch" comes from Old French "crouchier" meaning "to bend down," ultimately from Vulgar Latin *coactare, a frequentative of Latin "cogere" meaning "to compel, force, collect."  This suggests the original sense of being forced into a bent posture.
