词源:  The origin of "dork" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in American slang in the mid-20th century.  One theory connects it to the vulgar slang term for penis.  Another suggests a link to "dork," meaning "whale penis," used by whalers. However, these connections remain unproven.  The word gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s.
