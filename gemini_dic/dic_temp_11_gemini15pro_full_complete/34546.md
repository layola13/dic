ETYMOLOGY->
From clear + cut.  "Clear" comes from Old French "clair" (bright, shining), ultimately from Latin "clarus". "Cut" comes from Old English "cuttian" (to cut).  The sense of "clear-cut" developed in the 19th century, referring to something sharply defined or delineated, as if cut with a sharp instrument.
