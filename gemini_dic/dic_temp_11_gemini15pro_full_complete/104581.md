词源: From Polish *kania, ultimately from Proto-Slavic *kanja.  Related to Lithuanian kenis (“heron”), Latvian ķānis (“heron”), Old Prussian kēnis (“heron”), and possibly to Ancient Greek κάννα (“reed”).  The connection between "heron" and "crab" is uncertain, but may be due to similar leg structure or feeding habits.
