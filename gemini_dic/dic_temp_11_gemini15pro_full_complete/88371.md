Etymology:  hipster + -ish.  "Hipster" emerged in the 1940s referring to jazz enthusiasts, and was revived in the 1990s and 2000s to describe a subculture associated with indie music, vintage fashion, and a perceived ironic detachment.  The suffix "-ish" adds the sense of "somewhat" or "resembling."
