collisionally:/kəˈlɪʒənəli/
adverb|碰撞地；通过碰撞|In a manner characterized by collisions; as a result of collisions.|The particles interact collisionally, exchanging energy and momentum.|近义词：impactfully, forcefully|反义词: smoothly, gently|词性: 副词

Etymology:
From collision + -ally.  Collision ultimately derives from Latin collidere (to strike together).
