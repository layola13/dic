词源：
"Charge" comes from the Old French "chargier" (to load, burden), ultimately from Late Latin "carricare" (to load a car). The sense of being responsible for something developed from the idea of being entrusted with a burden or duty.  "In the charge of" emphasizes the state of being under someone's responsibility. "In charge of" emphasizes the authority and control aspect.
