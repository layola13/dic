词源: "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "bleach" (verb meaning "to whiten or remove color").  "Nonbleach" as a noun likely arose through back-formation from the adjective "nonbleached."  "Nonbleaches" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "nonbleach," although it is more commonly used as an adjective.
