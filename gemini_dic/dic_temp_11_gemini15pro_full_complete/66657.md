exciton:/ˈɛksɪtɒn/ (US) /ˈɛksɪtɒn/ (UK)| n. |激子|A bound state of an electron and a hole, which are attracted to each other by the electrostatic Coulomb force. It is an electrically neutral quasiparticle that exists in insulators, semiconductors, and some liquids.|The researchers studied the behavior of excitons in organic semiconductors.|近义词:quasiparticle|反义词: (No direct antonym, could consider "free electron" and "free hole" as conceptually opposite)|noun
