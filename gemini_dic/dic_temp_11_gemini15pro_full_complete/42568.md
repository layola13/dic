en passant:/ˌɒ̃ ˈpɑːsɒ̃/, /ɑːn ˈpæsənt/ | n. | 过路兵 | A special move in chess where a pawn can capture an opponent's pawn that has just moved two squares forward from its starting position, as if the captured pawn had moved only one square forward.  This move can only be made on the very next turn. | Example:  Black advanced his pawn two squares, and I took it en passant. 黑方卒子前进了两格，我用过路兵吃掉了它。
Example:  En passant is a tricky move that often catches beginners off guard. 过路兵是一个棘手的走法，经常让初学者措手不及。| Synonym: in passing | Antonym: N/A | noun

counterpassant:  (Not a valid word in standard English dictionaries or chess terminology) | N/A |  反过路兵 (This translation is based on the components "counter" and "en passant," but is not a recognized term.) | There is no official chess move or standard English word "counterpassant." This term likely arises from a misunderstanding or misapplication of the "en passant" rule. It could potentially refer to a hypothetical or imagined counter to the en passant move, but no such counter exists in the rules of chess. |  N/A (Since this word isn't valid, example sentences are impossible.) | Synonym: N/A | Antonym: N/A | N/A
