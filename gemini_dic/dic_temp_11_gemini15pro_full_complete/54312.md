词源:  "Dishable" comes from the verb "to dish," which originally meant "to serve food."  The slang meaning of "to dish" (to gossip or spread information) likely arose from the idea of serving up information like food, especially something tasty or scandalous.  "Dishable" then follows as an adjective describing something worthy of being "dished."
