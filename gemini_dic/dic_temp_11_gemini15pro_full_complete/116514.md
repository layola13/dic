mateyest 并非一个标准的英语单词。可能是 matey 的拼写错误，也可能是 matey 和 est（最高级后缀）的组合，但这种组合在英语中并不常见。因此，我将分别解析 matey 和 -est，并假设 mateyest 是指 "most matey" 的意思。

**matey:**

/ˈmeɪti/ | n. | 朋友，伙伴；老兄，老弟 | A friendly term of address, often used by sailors. |  "Ahoy there, matey!" shouted the pirate. “喂，伙计！”海盗喊道。 | synonyms: friend, pal, buddy, chum | antonyms: enemy, foe | noun

**-est:**

/ɪst/ | suffix | 最高级后缀 | Used to form the superlative degree of adjectives and adverbs. |  This is the smallest apple I've ever seen. 这是我见过的最小的苹果。 | N/A | N/A | suffix


Assuming "mateyest" means "most matey":

/ˈmeɪtiɪst/ (hypothetical pronunciation) | adj. | 最友好的 | Most friendly or companionable, like a mate. | He was the mateyest pirate I'd ever met, always offering a drink and a song. 他是我见过的最友好的海盗，总是请人喝酒唱歌。 | synonyms: friendliest, most companionable, most sociable | antonyms: unfriendliest, most hostile | adjective
