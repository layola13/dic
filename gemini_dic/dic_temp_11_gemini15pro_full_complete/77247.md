Gasteromycetes are a group of fungi whose spores develop inside an enclosed fruiting body, rather than on an exposed surface, such as gills. |  Example 1: The puffball is a common example of a gastromyces.  马勃菌是腹菌的常见例子。

Example 2:  Gastromyces are known for their diverse shapes and sizes.  腹菌以其形状和大小的多样性而闻名。 | Synonym: gasteroid fungus, stomach fungus | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it is a specific type of fungus) | Noun
