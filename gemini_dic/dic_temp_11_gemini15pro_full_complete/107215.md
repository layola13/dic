ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "lay by," meaning to put something aside or save it. "Lay" in this context comes from Old English "lecgan," meaning "to put, place, or cause to lie down." "By" comes from Old English "bi," meaning "near, at the side of, by."  Over time, the phrasal verb developed a noun and adjective form.
