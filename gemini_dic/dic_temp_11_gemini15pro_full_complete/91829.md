hypergeneticalness:/ˌhaɪpərjəˈnɛtɪkəlnəs/ | n. | 超遗传性 |  The state or quality of being hypergenetical; excessive or exaggerated genetic influence.  This word is rarely used and considered highly technical. |  There is little research exploring the hypergeneticalness of this particular trait.  这个特定性状的超遗传性研究很少。 |  Near synonyms might include "strong genetic determinism" or "high heritability," but these don't capture the potentially exaggerated nuance of "hypergeneticalness." | No direct antonym exists, but one could consider "environmental influence" as a contrasting concept. | noun
