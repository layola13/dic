注意事项：

"Chudah" (Hebrew:  חוּדָה) is a transliteration and therefore doesn't have a standardized English pronunciation. The pronunciation provided is a common approximation.  It's primarily used within Jewish communities. While it can be translated as "miracle," it carries a deeper connotation of divine intervention and awe.
