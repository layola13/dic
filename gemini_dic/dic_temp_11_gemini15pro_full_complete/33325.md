词源:

The "pleased" meaning originated in the late 19th century as a slang term, possibly from dialectal *chuff*, meaning "puffed up," suggesting an inflated sense of self-satisfaction. The "annoyed" meaning, primarily used in Northern England, likely derives from a different source, possibly related to the verb *chuff*, meaning "to puff or blow," suggesting an expression of irritation.
