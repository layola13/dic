The word "beeregar" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or possibly a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

However, if you meant **"bereft,"**  here's the analysis:

bereft: /bɪˈrɛft/ | adj. | 丧失的，被剥夺的 | Deprived of or lacking something, especially something nonmaterial such as a quality or attribute. | Example:  Bereft of hope, he wandered aimlessly. 他丧失了希望，漫无目的地游荡。| Example: The flood left many people bereft of their homes. 洪水使许多人失去了家园。 | Synonym: deprived, lacking, wanting | Antonym: replete, full, abundant |  Word Class: Adjective
