词源:
noneffervescently comes from "noneffervescent" + "-ly."  "Noneffervescent" is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") added to "effervescent." "Effervescent" itself comes from the Latin word "effervescere," meaning "to boil up" or "to ferment,"  from "ex-" (out) + "fervescere" (to boil). The suffix "-ly" turns the adjective into an adverb.
