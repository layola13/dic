ETYMOLOGY->
From the Latin word "curatus," meaning "cared for," past participle of "curare" (to care for). Originally, a curator was a caretaker, particularly of souls (a parish priest).  The meaning evolved to include the care and management of a collection, leading to the modern sense of carefully selecting and presenting items.
