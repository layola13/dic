PHRASE->
There isn't a common set of phrases using "overextract" in the way that a word like "take" would have.  Since it is a fairly specific term related to brewing or extraction processes, common collocations might involve the substance being overextracted, such as "overextract coffee," "overextract tea," or "overextract herbs."
