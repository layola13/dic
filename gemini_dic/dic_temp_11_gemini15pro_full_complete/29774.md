PHRASE->
(While "cattiness's" is grammatically correct as a possessive, it's highly uncommon and generally awkward.  It's much more natural to use "cattiness" directly or rephrase using "someone's cattiness".  Therefore, phrases using "cattiness's" are not provided as they would be forced and unnatural.)
