词源： Bruner likely comes from the Middle English word "brunen" meaning "to burn,"  related to the Old English "byrnan" and the German "brennen."  This suggests an occupational origin, referring to someone who works with fire or burning materials, like charcoal burners or, as in one of its meanings, someone who mines and burns brown coal (lignite).


注意事项:  The word "bruner" is not commonly used in modern English.  "Arsonist" is more common for someone who sets fires deliberately, and "lignite miner" is the standard term for someone who mines brown coal.  The meaning related to sunburn is also archaic.
