词源:  From degrading + -ness.  "Degrading" comes from the late Middle English "degradinge," from the Old French "degrader," and ultimately from the Latin "degradare," meaning "to step down," from "de-" (down) + "gradus" (step, degree).  The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
