nondispersion:/ˌnɒndɪˈspɜːʃən/ | n. | 非分散性；非弥散性 | The lack of separation of light or other radiation into its constituent wavelengths. This means that the different wavelengths of light do not spread out or disperse. | The prism demonstrated the nondispersion of the specific light source.  这个棱镜证明了特定光源的非分散性。| Near synonyms: non-scattering, non-divergence | Antonyms: dispersion, scattering | noun

nondispersive:/ˌnɒndɪˈspɜːsɪv/ | adj. | 非分散的；非弥散的 | Not undergoing or causing dispersion.  This means that the material or process does not cause different wavelengths of light to spread out. |  A nondispersive prism was used in the experiment.  实验中使用了一个非分散棱镜。 | Near synonyms: non-scattering, non-divergent | Antonyms: dispersive, scattering | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From non- (prefix meaning "not") + dispersion (from Latin dispersio, meaning "a scattering").
