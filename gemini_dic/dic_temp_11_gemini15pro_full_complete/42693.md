counterterm:/ˈkaʊntərˌtɜːrm/| n. |反项，抵消项|A term added to a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian in quantum field theory to compensate for undesirable effects, such as infinities or unwanted interactions. It effectively cancels out the problematic terms, ensuring the theory remains consistent and predictive.|Quantum field theory uses counterterms to eliminate divergences.|近义词: compensating term, correction term |反义词: N/A | noun
