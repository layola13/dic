nonrefractiveness:/ˌnɒnriˈfræktɪvnəs/ | n. | 非折射性；不折射 | The nonrefractiveness of the material makes it unsuitable for lenses. 这种材料的非折射性使其不适合用于透镜。|  The nonrefractiveness of the surface prevented the light from bending. 表面的非折射性阻止了光线弯曲。 | 近义词: opacity, opaqueness | 反义词: refractiveness, transparency | 词性: noun

Etymology: non- (prefix meaning "not") + refractive + -ness (suffix forming nouns from adjectives)  From Latin refractus, past participle of refringere "to break up, break open, shatter," from re- "back, again" (see re-) + frangere "to break" (see fragile).
