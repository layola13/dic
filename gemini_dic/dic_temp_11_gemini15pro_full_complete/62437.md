endoplastule: /ˈɛndəʊplæstjuːl/ | n. | 内质体 | A small, starch-containing plastid found in some algae and protozoa. | Example 1: Endoplastules are responsible for storing starch within the organism. 内质体负责在生物体内储存淀粉。

Example 2: The researchers observed the endoplastules under a powerful microscope. 研究人员在高倍显微镜下观察内质体。 | Near Synonyms: pyrenoid, amyloplast | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific organelle) | Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From  endo- (within) + -plast (formed element) + -ule (diminutive suffix).  Ultimately from Greek *éndon (within) and *plastós (formed, molded).
