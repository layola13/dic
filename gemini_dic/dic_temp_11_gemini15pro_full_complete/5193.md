PHRASE->

Unfortunately, "alliable" is not commonly used enough to have established phrases associated with it.  It is primarily used in formal or technical contexts, such as political science or international relations.


词源:

From "ally" + "-able". "Ally" comes from Old French "alier" meaning "to unite, join, or bind". "-able" is a suffix indicating capability or suitability.
