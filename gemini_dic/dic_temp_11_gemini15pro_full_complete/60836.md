ETYMOLOGY->
From electro- + static.  "Electro-" comes from the Greek word "elektron" meaning "amber," referencing the early experiments with static electricity generated by rubbing amber. "Static" comes from the Greek word "statikos," meaning "causing to stand," referring to the stationary nature of the charges.
