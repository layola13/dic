词源：From Middle French *nectar*, from Latin nectar, from Ancient Greek νέκταρ (néktar, “drink of the gods”), of uncertain origin. Perhaps from *νη- (nē-) +‎ *κτόνος (któnos, “slaying”).  The Greek word νέκταρ originally referred to the drink of the gods which conferred immortality, while their food, ἀμβροσία (ambrosía), conferred eternal youth.
