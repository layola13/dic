##pistonsA piston is a component of reciprocating engines, pumps, and compressors.It is a cylindrical component that is moved by pressure within a cylinder.  Piston movement generates a force used to create either linear or rotary motion.  Theyare critical for converting energy into mechanical work. |  The car engine's pistons were worn out, requiring replacement.  这辆汽车的活塞磨损了，需要更换。 The pump's pistons pushed the water upwards.  泵的活塞将水向上推。 | cylinders, plungers |  (Near antonyms depend heavily on context; a  lack of pistons wouldmean a lack of function, so no true antonym exists)pestle".  The connection lies in the similar cylindrical shape and pounding/pushing action of both pistons and pestles.  The evolution from a tool for crushing to a key component of engines reflects a fascinating adaptation of a basic mechanical concept.technical contexts relating to engineering and mechanics.  Its meaning rarely deviates from its core definition.  Understanding its function within a system requires familiarity with the principles of pressure, volume, and force conversion.:** The pistons in this engine are made of titanium.

(到那时，他们将已经致力于重新设计五年了。)“活塞”的意义依赖于其所在系统。 没有活塞意味着该系统无法工作，所以没有真正的反义词。
