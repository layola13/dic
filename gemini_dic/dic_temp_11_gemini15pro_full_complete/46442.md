PHRASE->
N/A (This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases. It is a dialectal plural of "day.")

注意事项:
dags is a very localized, informal term.  While understood in parts of Scotland and Northern England, using it in other contexts might lead to confusion. It's best to stick with "days" in standard English.
