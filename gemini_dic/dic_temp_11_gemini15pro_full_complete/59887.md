The word "edara" does not appear to be a valid English word. It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, a technical term, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  

If you can provide more context, such as the language it's from or the context in which you encountered it, I may be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests examples of "what" usage, I can provide that information:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonyms: which, how, why | Antonyms: (No direct antonyms for "what") | Pronoun/Determiner/Adverb
