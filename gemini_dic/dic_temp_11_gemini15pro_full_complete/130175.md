non-rigid:/ˌnɒnˈrɪdʒɪd/ /ˌnɑːnˈrɪdʒɪd/| adj.|非刚性的，非坚硬的|Not rigid; flexible or pliable.|The robot arm is non-rigid, allowing it to adapt to different shapes.|flexible, pliable, elastic, soft|rigid, stiff, inflexible|adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + rigid.  "Rigid" comes from the Latin "rigidus" meaning stiff or hard.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not."
