PHRASE->
(Not applicable. "Grayness's" is not commonly used in phrases.)

注意事项:
The use of "grayness's" is rare and can sound awkward. "The grayness of" is generally preferred.  Using "grayness's" implies possession, which is unusual in this context.  For example, "the grayness of the sky" is much more natural than "the sky's grayness" or "the grayness's of the sky."
