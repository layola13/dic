注意事项:

*  Avoid using "concupiscently" in casual conversation. It sounds overly formal and even pretentious.
*  Be mindful of the potentially offensive nature of the word, especially in sensitive contexts.
*  Consider using a less charged synonym like "lustfully" or "desirefully" in most situations.
