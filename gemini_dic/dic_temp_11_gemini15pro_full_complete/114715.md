词源：
The word "mallemock" is of uncertain origin.  It is likely related to the Middle English word "malemock," which meant "a foolish or clumsy person."  This word may be a blend of "male" (meaning bad or evil) and "mock" (meaning to ridicule or make fun of).  Therefore, the original meaning might have been someone who is badly mocked or ridiculed, eventually evolving to mean someone foolish enough to be mocked.
