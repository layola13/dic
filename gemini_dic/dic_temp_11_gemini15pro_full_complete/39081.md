Etymology:
From "confoundedness," which is derived from "confound" (verb).  "Confound" comes from the Old French "confondre," which in turn derives from the Latin "confundere" meaning "to pour together, mix, confuse."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "confounded" into the noun "confoundedness." The additional "'s" indicates the possessive form of the noun.
