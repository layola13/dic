cytop:/ˈsaɪtɒp/ (UK) /ˈsaɪtɑːp/ (US)| n. |细胞质|The cytoplasm of a cell is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell and surrounds the nucleus.|The cytop of the cell was clearly visible under the microscope. 细胞质在显微镜下清晰可见。|近义词: cytoplasm|反义词: 无|词性: 名词

词源:  "cytop" is a shortened, informal term derived from "cytoplasm."  "Cyto-" comes from the Greek "kytos" meaning "a hollow, receptacle, basket," later used to refer to a "cell." "-plasm" also comes from Greek "plasma" meaning "something molded or formed."
