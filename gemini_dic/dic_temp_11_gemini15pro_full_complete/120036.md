PHRASE->
(Due to the informal and hyperbolic nature of "milliony," it doesn't readily form set phrases.  The following are examples of how it might be used colloquially.)
Thanks a milliony! =  非常感谢！(A playful exaggeration of "thanks a million")
I've told you milliony times! = 我告诉过你无数次了！
There are milliony and one things to do. = 有很多很多事情要做。
I have milliony questions. = 我有很多问题。
He has milliony ideas. = 他有很多想法。


注意事项: "Milliony" is highly informal and hyperbolic.  While effective in conveying a sense of vastness in casual conversation, it's best avoided in formal writing or academic contexts. Using "millions of" or other more standard synonyms is generally preferred.
