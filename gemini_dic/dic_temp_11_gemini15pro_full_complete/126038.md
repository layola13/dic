PHRASE->

must-ache for something = 渴望某物


词源:  "Must" conveys a sense of necessity or obligation, while "ache" refers to a persistent dull pain or longing.  The combined term "must-ache" emphasizes a strong, urgent desire.  It is a relatively recent coinage and not as common as other synonyms for craving or yearning.  "Must" 本身带有必要性或义务的含义，而 "ache" 指的是持续的隐痛或渴望。组合词 "must-ache" 强调了一种强烈、迫切的愿望。这是一个相对较新的词汇，不像其他渴望或 yearning 的同义词那样常见。
