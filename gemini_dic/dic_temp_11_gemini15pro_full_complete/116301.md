The word "massoola" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It might be a slang term, a misspelling, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, the language it might be from), I can try to provide more information.  Since I cannot analyze "massoola," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "axiom."

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理; 定理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应与恐怖分子谈判，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。

Example:  One of the key axioms of the theory of evolution is that all life evolved from a common ancestor.  进化论的一个关键公理是所有生命都从一个共同的祖先进化而来。 | Synonym:  principle, theorem, postulate, maxim | Antonym:  paradox, absurdity | noun
