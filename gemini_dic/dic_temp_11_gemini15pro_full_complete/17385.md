ETYMOLOGY->
From bead +‎ -y +‎ eyed.  "Bead" originally referred to a prayer, and later to the small balls used for counting prayers, which then became a general term for small, round objects. "Eyed" simply means "having eyes (of a certain kind)."  Thus, "beady-eyed" literally describes having eyes like beads.
