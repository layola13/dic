词源:

"Overloftiness" is derived from "lofty," which comes from the Old Norse word *lopt, meaning "air, sky."  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning to imply excess.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "lofty" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being lofty.  The plural form, "overloftinesses,"  is less commonly used and generally refers to multiple instances or manifestations of this quality.  For instance, one might refer to the "overloftinesses of the aristocracy" to describe the various ways in which they displayed arrogance.
