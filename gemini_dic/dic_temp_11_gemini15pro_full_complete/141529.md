PHRASE->

Since "oppletion" isn't a recognized word, it doesn't have established phrases.  If it were a valid word meaning "completion,"  potential phrases *could* theoretically be:

*  time to oppletion (完成时间)
*  degree of oppletion (完成程度)
*  oppletion rate (完成率)
*  oppletion stage (完成阶段)
*  near oppletion (接近完成)


注意事项:

As previously stated, "oppletion" isn't a standard English word.  This analysis is based on conjecture and potential roots. You should avoid using this word in formal or professional writing.  If you encountered this word somewhere, it's likely a misspelling or a neologism specific to a very limited context.
