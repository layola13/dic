misclosure:/ˌmɪsˈkloʊʒər/ | n. | 闭合差，闭合误差 | The difference between the measured value of a closed traverse and its theoretical value.  It represents the accumulated errors in the measurements. | The misclosure in the survey was larger than acceptable.  测量中的闭合差大于可接受的范围。 | The misclosure was so small that it could be ignored. 闭合差很小，可以忽略不计。 | 近义词：discrepancy, error, deviation | 反义词：closure, agreement | 词性: noun
