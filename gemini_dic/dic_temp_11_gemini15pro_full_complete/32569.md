chirality:/kaɪˈrælɪti/ | n. |手性 |The property of a molecule that makes it impossible to superimpose it on its mirror image.  A chiral molecule exists in two forms (enantiomers) that are mirror images of one another but cannot be superimposed.| The chirality of a drug molecule can significantly affect its pharmacological activity.  药物分子的手性会显著影响其药理活性。| 近义词: handedness, dissymmetry | 反义词: achirality | 词性: noun

chirality:/kaɪˈrælɪti/ | n. |手性 |The "handedness" of a molecule.  Just like your left and right hands are mirror images but cannot be superimposed, chiral molecules exist in two forms that are mirror images but non-superimposable.|  The chirality of amino acids is crucial for protein structure and function. 氨基酸的手性对于蛋白质的结构和功能至关重要。| 近义词: handedness, dissymmetry | 反义词: achirality | 词性: noun
