词源:

"Fugging" is a euphemism derived from the taboo word "fucking."  It likely originated through a process called "minced oath," where part of a taboo word is altered to make it less offensive. This can involve changing vowels, consonants, or adding extra syllables.  The "g" sound is a common substitute for the "k" sound in such euphemisms.
