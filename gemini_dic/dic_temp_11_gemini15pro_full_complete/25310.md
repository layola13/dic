Etymology:

"bugginess" comes from "buggy" + "-ness". "Buggy" originally referred to horse-drawn carriages, but in the context of computing, it means "full of bugs" (errors). "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  "bug" in the computing sense originated in the mid-20th century, possibly referring to actual insects causing malfunctions in early computers. The possessive " 's " is a standard English possessive marker.
