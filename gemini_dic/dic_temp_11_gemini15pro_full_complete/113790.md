macrozoospore: /ˈmækroʊˈzoʊˌspɔːr/
n.
大型游动孢子
A large, motile zoospore; specifically, a relatively large asexual spore characteristic of certain algae and fungi, often multinucleate and formed in a macrozoosporangium.
Macrozoospores are released from the zoosporangium and swim to a suitable substrate where they germinate and develop into a new individual.
例句：
The macrozoospores of *Phytophthora infestans* are responsible for the spread of late blight in potatoes.
大型游动孢子导致了马铃薯晚疫病的蔓延。

The alga releases macrozoospores into the water column.
这种藻类将大型游动孢子释放到水体中。

近义词: zoospore, megaspore
反义词: microspore
