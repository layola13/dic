controllability's:/kənˌtrəʊləˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可控性 | The quality or state of being controllable; the degree to which something can be controlled. | The controllability's of the new aircraft impressed the pilots. 新飞机的可控性给飞行员留下了深刻印象。| Synonyms: manageability, governability | Antonyms: uncontrollability, unmanageability | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From controllable + -ity + -'s (possessive).  Controllable traces back through French *controlable to the verb control, ultimately from Medieval Latin contrarotulus, meaning "a counter-roll" (used for checking accounts). The suffix -ity denotes a state or quality. The final -'s indicates possession.
