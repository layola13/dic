ETYMOLOGY->
From "mantel" (meaning a cloak or covering, later applied to the structure surrounding a fireplace) + "tree" (likely referring to the shape of some early mantelpieces resembling a lintel supported by two uprights, or perhaps to the decorative boughs often placed on them).  The term "manteltree" became popularized in the 19th century.
