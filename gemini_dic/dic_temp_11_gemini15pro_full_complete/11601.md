arkose:/ˈɑːrkoʊs/ | n. |长石砂岩 |A sedimentary rock composed primarily of feldspar grains, usually derived from the disintegration of granite or other igneous rocks, and often containing quartz and mica. | The geologist identified the sample as arkose due to its high feldspar content. 地质学家根据其高长石含量将样品鉴定为长石砂岩。| synonyms: feldspathic sandstone | antonyms:  N/A (Arkose is a specific rock type; there isn't a direct opposite.) | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *arkose*, from German *Arkose*, a blend of *Ar* (feldspar) + *kose* (a suffix indicating a coarse-grained sedimentary rock).  *Ar* ultimately derives from Swedish *ård*, meaning "plowed field," referring to the easily weathered nature of feldspar-rich soil.
