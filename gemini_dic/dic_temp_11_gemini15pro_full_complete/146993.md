词源：Overkill originated in the context of nuclear warfare, referring to the use of excessive nuclear firepower beyond what was necessary to destroy a target.  The term later broadened to its current general meaning of using excessive force or resources in any context.  "Overkill" first appeared in the early 1960s.
