词源:
The origin of "cockamamie" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's related to the now-obsolete "decalcomania," referring to the process of transferring designs to pottery. Another connects it to "cock-and-bull story," meaning a fabricated tale. A third possibility links it to the French "décalcomanie," which might have been altered in American slang.  Ultimately, the etymology remains somewhat mysterious.
