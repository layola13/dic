cotransducing:/ˌkoʊtrænsˈdʊːsɪŋ/ | adj. | 共转导的 | Transferring genes simultaneously.  Relates to the simultaneous transfer of two or more genes by transduction.  Often used in bacterial genetics. | The cotransducing frequency can help determine the relative proximity of two genes on a bacterial chromosome. 共转导频率有助于确定细菌染色体上两个基因的相对接近度。

The experiment demonstrated cotransducing of antibiotic resistance genes.  该实验证明了抗生素抗性基因的共转导。 | 近义词: co-transferring, linked | 反义词: unlinked | 词性: adjective

词源: co- (together) + transducing (from transduction, meaning the transfer of genetic material from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage)
