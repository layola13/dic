PHRASE->
(Not applicable - 'indentedly' is an adverb of manner and doesn't typically form set phrases.  It describes *how* something is done, rather than forming a distinct meaning with another word.)


词源: From indent + -ed + -ly.  "Indent" comes from Old French "endent," meaning "a tooth," referring to the shape created by an indentation.
