holosteric:/ˌhɒləˈstɛrɪk/ | adj. | 全位效应的，整体效应的 | Relating to or denoting the binding of a regulatory molecule to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, with the effect of altering the enzyme's activity.  It implies that the entire enzyme molecule, or a substantial part of it, undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding, which affects its activity. | The holosteric enzyme's activity was modulated by the binding of a small molecule. 全位效应酶的活性受到小分子结合的调节。

The researchers studied the holosteric regulation of the enzyme in detail. 研究人员详细研究了该酶的全位效应调节。 | 近义词: allosteric | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but one might consider "orthosteric," referring to binding at the active site) | 词性: adjective
