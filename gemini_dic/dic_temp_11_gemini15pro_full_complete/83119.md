用法说明：
"Gustiness's" is not a standard English word.  While grammatically possible (showing possession of the quality of gustiness), it's highly unusual and awkward.  It's much more natural and common to use "the gustiness of" followed by the noun possessing the gustiness.  For example, "the gustiness of the wind," "the gustiness of the storm," etc.  Using the possessive " 's " with an abstract noun like "gustiness" is generally avoided.
