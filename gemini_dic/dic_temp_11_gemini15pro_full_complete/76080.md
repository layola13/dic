词源:  The word "furphy" originated in Australia during World War I. It derives from the name of a company, J. Furphy & Sons, which manufactured water carts used by the Australian army.  Soldiers would gather around these carts to exchange news and gossip, and often the information shared was unreliable or exaggerated. Hence, the term "furphy" became associated with rumour and misinformation.
