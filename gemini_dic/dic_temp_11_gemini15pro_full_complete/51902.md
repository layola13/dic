注意事项:

"dhi" itself is not a standard English word. It seems to be a phonetic representation, possibly intended to represent the pronunciation of "the" with a specific accent or dialect.  This analysis is based on the closest standard English equivalent, "this."  If a different meaning was intended, please clarify.
