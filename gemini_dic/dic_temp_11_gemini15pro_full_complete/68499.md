PHRASE->
(Not applicable as "famousnesses" is rarely used and doesn't have common phrases associated with it.)

注意事项:
The word "famousnesses" is grammatically correct but very uncommon and generally avoided in standard English.  "Fame," "celebrity," or "renown" are preferred.  Using degrees of comparison with "fame" (e.g., "greater fame," "more famous") is more natural than using "famousnesses."
