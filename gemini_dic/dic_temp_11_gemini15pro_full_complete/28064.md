Etymology:  Likely a blend of "caper" (meaning a playful leap or skip) and "claw" (suggesting energetic movement, perhaps reminiscent of an animal playfully using its claws).  No definitive etymological source exists, and the word is considered dialectical or regional, primarily found in Scotland and Northern England.
