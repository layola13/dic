metagenetic:/ˌmɛtədʒəˈnɛtɪk/ | adj. | 世代交替的 | Relating to or characterized by metagenesis, a type of life cycle in which a sexual phase alternates with an asexual phase. |  Many cnidarians exhibit a metagenetic life cycle, alternating between polyp and medusa forms. 许多刺胞动物表现出世代交替的生命周期，在水螅体和水母体之间交替。 | The fern's metagenetic life cycle involves both a sporophyte and a gametophyte generation. 蕨类植物的世代交替生命周期包括孢子体世代和配子体世代。 | 近义词: heterogenetic | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but consider "homogenetic" for organisms with a single reproductive strategy) | 词性: 形容词
