注意事项:
"Indamage" is not a standard English word. The correct word is "damage."  While grammatically possible to create "indamage" by adding the prefix "in-", it is not commonly used and "damage" serves the purpose perfectly. All examples and conjugations provided are using the correct form "damage".
