词源:  "Illywhacker" is Australian slang of uncertain origin.  One theory suggests it's derived from "Willy Wagtail," a common Australian bird. Another suggests a connection to "whacker," meaning something large or impressive.  The term gained popularity after Peter Carey's novel "Illywhacker" (1985).
