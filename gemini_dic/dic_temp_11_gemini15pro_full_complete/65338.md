注意事项:
"euk" is an informal abbreviation and not a formally recognized word.  It's generally used in informal scientific discussions or shorthand notes.  In formal writing, "eukaryote" is the preferred term.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples for all tenses might feel a bit forced, as the term itself isn't typically used in a wide variety of grammatical contexts.
