From Latin *decumanus* (adjective), from *decem* ("ten").  Originally referring to the tenth cohort of a Roman legion and later to the main east-west street in a Roman camp or town, which was usually assigned to this cohort. The sense of "huge" or "enormous" likely developed from the perceived importance and size of the decumanus.
