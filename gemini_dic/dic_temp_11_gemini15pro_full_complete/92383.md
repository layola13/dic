ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *ipocrisie*, from Old French *ypocrisie*, from Late Latin *hypocrisis*, from Ancient Greek *ὑπόκρισις (hupókrisis, “acting of a theatrical part, pretense, dissimulation")*, from *ὑποκρίνομαι (hupokrínomai, “I answer, play a part, pretend")*, from *ὑπό (hupó, “under")* + *κρίνω (krínō, “I separate, decide, judge")*.  The sense evolution in Greek started from "answering", to "interpreting", to "acting, playing a role", and finally to "feigning, pretending".
