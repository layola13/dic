注意事项:
As noted above, "len" is not a common English word outside of programming contexts.  It's a shortened form of "length" used in some programming languages, most notably Python.  Therefore, many of the example sentences, particularly those not related to programming, feel somewhat artificial.  In regular English, one would simply use "length".
