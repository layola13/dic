词源: Old English *lēce (noun), *lēc- (verb), of Germanic origin; related to Dutch leik and German Laich ‘spawn,’ from an Indo-European root shared by Latin linquere ‘to leave.’ The original sense was probably ‘physician,’ later ‘bloodsucking worm.’ The adjective leechlike is formed by adding the suffix -like to the noun leech.
