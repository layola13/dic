From bewitching + -ly.  Bewitching comes from the verb bewitch, from be- + witch.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "thoroughly" or "completely," and "witch" refers to a person who practices witchcraft or magic.  Therefore, "bewitch" means to affect as if by magic, and "bewitchingly" describes the manner in which something is captivating or enchanting.
