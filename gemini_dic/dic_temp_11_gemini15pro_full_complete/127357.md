ncr:/ˈɛn siː ɑːr/ |abbr.| (mathematics) n choose r; the binomial coefficient; the number of combinations of n things taken r at a time |  nCr represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without regard to order. | The nCr formula is n! / (r! * (n-r)!). For example, 5C3 is calculated as 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10. There are 10 ways to choose 3 items from a set of 5. | synonym: combination, binomial coefficient | antonym: permutation (order matters in permutations) | abbreviation
