kaolinization:/ˌkeɪəlɪnaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |高岭石化，瓷土化 |The process by which feldspar and other silicate minerals are altered to kaolinite, a type of clay mineral, typically through hydrothermal alteration or weathering. |Example 1: Kaolinization of the granite resulted in the formation of a rich kaolin deposit. 花岗岩的高岭石化作用形成了一个丰富的高岭土矿床。

Example 2:  The degree of kaolinization varies depending on the intensity and duration of the hydrothermal activity. 高岭石化的程度取决于热液活动的强度和持续时间。 | Synonym: argillization | Antonym: N/A | noun
