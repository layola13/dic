disencrease is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a blend of "decrease" and perhaps "disincentivize."  Therefore, I will analyze "decrease" as it's likely the intended word.

decrease: /dɪˈkriːs/ (UK) /ˈdiːkriːs/ (US)
| n. vi. vt.| 减少，降低；减少量 | A decrease in sales. 销售额下降。 | 近义词: decline, lessen, diminish, reduce, fall, drop | 反义词: increase, rise, grow, expand | 词性: noun, verb


Etymology:
From Old French *decreiss-, from Latin decrescere "to grow less," from de- "down" + crescere "to grow."
