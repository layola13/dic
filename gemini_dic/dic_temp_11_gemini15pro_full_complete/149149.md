##oxindol 详细解析| n. | 恶唑烷酮；靛红醇 |  Oxindole is a heterocyclic compound containing both a benzene ring and a pyrrolidinone ring. It's a lactam derivative of indole, meaning it's formed by the cyclic amide formation of indole-2-carboxylic acid.  Oxindole itself is colorless, but its derivatives can vary widely in colorand properties depending on the substituents attached. It has significant applications in synthetic chemistry as a building block for various molecules, particularly in medicinal chemistry. | Oxindole derivatives are often found in natural products like alkaloids and are components present in many pharmaceuticals. For example, certain oxindole derivatives serve as potent anti-inflammatory or anti-cancer agents under research. |  近义词:  (lacking direct synonyms due to its specific chemical structure) | 反义词: (lacking direct antonyms due to its specific chemical structure)aromatic organic compound, through a specific chemical modification. The process involves forming a lactam ring, which closes the structure by incorporating an oxygen atom.Block in Organic Synthesis:** Oxindole serves as a versatile starting material for the synthesis of more complex heterocycles and bioactive compounds.  Its reactive sites allow it to undergo various modifications using known organic reactions (alkylation, acylation, etc.), generating a variety of derivatives.A significant amount of research focuses on oxindole derivatives because of their pharmacological activities.  Many derivatives exhibit properties useful for creating drugs with various functionalities. For example, some show potential as antidepressants, anti-cancer agents, and anti-inflammatory drugs.
