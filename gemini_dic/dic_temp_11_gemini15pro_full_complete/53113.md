diphyozooid:/ˌdɪfaɪˈzoʊɔɪd/ | n. |  二体型水螅体 | A free-swimming, sexually reproducing medusa budded off from a hydroid colony, specifically in certain hydrozoans (such as Obelia). It is responsible for producing gametes. | Example 1: The diphyozooid is a crucial part of the Obelia life cycle.  二体型水螅体是薮枝螅生命周期中的关键部分。

Example 2:  Diphyozooids are released into the water column where they reproduce sexually. 二体型水螅体被释放到水体中进行有性繁殖。 | Synonym: medusa (in this context), gonophore | Antonym:  N/A (no direct opposite for a specific reproductive structure) | Noun
