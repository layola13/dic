注意事项:
While "emptiable" is grammatically correct, "empty" is much more commonly used as a verb.  "Emptiable" is primarily used to describe the capability of something to be emptied.  While technically correct in the examples above, using "emptying" or "to empty" would be more natural in most cases.
