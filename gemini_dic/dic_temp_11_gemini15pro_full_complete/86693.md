注意事项:
"Helloing" although grammatically possible, is not commonly used in standard English.  "Greeting" is a more natural and frequently used alternative.  While all the example sentences are grammatically correct, they would sound unusual to a native English speaker.  It's recommended to use "greet" instead.
