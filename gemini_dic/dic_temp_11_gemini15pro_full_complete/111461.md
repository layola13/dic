注意事项:

"Lo" is an archaic and literary word, rarely used in modern English. It's primarily found in older texts, poetry, or for dramatic effect.  It doesn't have a different pronunciation in British or American English. While grammatically an interjection, its function is similar to "look" or "behold."  It's not typically used in different tenses or grammatical constructions.
