词源:

"Over-" (Old English *ofer) meaning "above, beyond, across" + "liberal" (from Latin "liberalis" meaning "befitting a free man, noble, generous") + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning of "liberal," suggesting an excess or going beyond what is considered appropriate.
