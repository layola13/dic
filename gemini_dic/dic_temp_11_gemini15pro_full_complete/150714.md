##paraboloid:/ˈpærəbəlɔɪd/ | n. |抛物面 |a quadric surface that has exactly one axis of symmetry and no center of symmetry unless it is a degenerate paraboloid which is a parabola rather than a surface.  It's a three-dimensional curved surface created by rotating a parabola around its axis of symmetry.  There are two main types: elliptic paraboloids (which resemble a bowl or a satellite dish) and hyperbolic paraboloids (which resemble a saddle).  The shape is commonly seen in various applications, from antennas to reflectors to architectural designs.dish is shaped like a **paraboloid** to focus the incoming radio waves.

Essentially, it describes a surface with a parabolic form. The "-oid" suffix indicates resemblance or likeness to something else.used in mathematics, physics, and engineering contexts to describe the specific three-dimensional shape. It appears in discussions of conic sections, optics, antenna design, and architectural structures.  Its use is generally technical and precise.downwards and has elliptical cross-sections parallel to the $xy$-plane.  Its equation is typically expressed as  $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = z$.like shape. Its cross-sections parallel to the $xy$-plane are hyperbolas, while those parallel to the $xz$-plane and $yz$-plane are parabolas.  Its equation can be represented as $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = z$.
