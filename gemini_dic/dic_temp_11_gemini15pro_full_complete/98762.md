ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *entailler* "to cut, notch," from *en-* "in" + *tailler* "to cut," from Latin *talea* "cutting, slip, rod."  The legal sense developed from the practice of cutting notches on a stick as a record of a transaction.  This evolved into the idea of "fixing" something permanently, like an inheritance.
