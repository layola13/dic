近义词: accidentally, incidentally, by chance, fortuitously
反义词: deliberately, intentionally, purposely
词性: 副词


Etymology:  From "chance" (from Old French "cheance," ultimately from Latin "cadentia," meaning "a falling, that which falls out, an accident") + "-able" (suffix meaning "capable of being," "worthy of being," or "tending to").  Therefore, "chanceable" means "capable of happening by chance."  The adverbial form "chanceably" adds the suffix "-ly."
