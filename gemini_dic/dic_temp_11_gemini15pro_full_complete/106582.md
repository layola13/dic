The word "kuan" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible you're thinking of a word from another language, a slang term, a misspelling, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (e.g., the language it's from, where you encountered it), I can offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests information on the word "what," I will provide that below:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv.|什么，多么| Used to ask for information about something or someone.|  What is your name? 你叫什么名字？|  What time is it? 现在几点了？|Synonyms: which, how, whatever | Antonyms: (No direct antonym for "what") | pronoun, determiner, adverb
