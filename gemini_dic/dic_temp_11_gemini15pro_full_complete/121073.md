Etymology:  From mis- + construe.  "Mis-" is a prefix of Old English and Old French origin meaning "wrongly" or "badly."  "Construe" comes from the Latin "construere," meaning "to pile up, heap together, construct, arrange, build," figuratively "to combine, connect," and later "to interpret, explain."  Therefore, "misconstrue" literally means to wrongly interpret or build an understanding.
