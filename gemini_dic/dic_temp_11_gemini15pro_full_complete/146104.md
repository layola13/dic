ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + elegantly.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively," and "elegantly" is the adverb form of "elegant," which comes from the French "élégant," ultimately from the Latin "eligere" meaning "to choose" or "select."  The implication is of something chosen with care and refinement.
