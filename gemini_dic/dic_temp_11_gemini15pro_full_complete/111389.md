PHRASE->
(Not typically used in phrases, as it's a descriptive adjective.  Livid describes a state, not an action or relationship between things, so it doesn't lend itself to fixed phrases.)


词源: From Latin *līvidus, from līvere (“to be bluish”).  The Latin word refers to the bluish-black color of bruises.
