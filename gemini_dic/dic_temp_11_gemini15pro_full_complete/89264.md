The word "homman" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a dialectal word, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or its intended meaning, I may be able to offer more specific information.  For example, if it's a name, I can't provide a definition, but I can tell you it's a proper noun.


However, since the request is for a demonstration of the format with a valid English word, I'll use the word "what" as an example:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
