PHRASE-> (This word doesn't typically form set phrases.  The concept of politeness is often expressed indirectly.)

词源:  From Middle English *litenes, from Old French *liteté, from Latin *lītitās (“smoothness, elegance"), from *lītis (“smooth, polished”).


注意事项:  "Litenesses" is a rather formal and somewhat archaic word.  While grammatically correct, it's not commonly used in modern English.  Simpler words like "courtesies" or "politeness" are generally preferred.
