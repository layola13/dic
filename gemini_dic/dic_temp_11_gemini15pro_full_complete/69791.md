fermiums:/ˈfɜːrmiəmz/ | n. | 镄 | A synthetic radioactive element of the actinide series, atomic number 100.  It is created by bombarding plutonium with neutrons. |  Fermiums, like other transuranium elements, are not found in nature. | 近义词: transuranium element (because it shares similar properties, although not a true synonym), actinide | 反义词: N/A (Elements don't have direct opposites) | noun
