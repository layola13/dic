Etymology:

"Over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi, meaning "above, over, beyond") + "caustic" (from Late Latin causticus, from Greek kaustikos, meaning "burning," from kaiein, "to burn") + "-ity" (suffix forming nouns of quality or state, from French -ité, from Latin -itas).  Therefore, "overcausticities" refers to the quality or state of being excessively caustic.
