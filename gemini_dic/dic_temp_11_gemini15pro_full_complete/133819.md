nonglobularly:/nɒnˈɡlɒbjʊləli/ (US) /nɑːnˈɡlɑːbjələli/| adv.|非球状地，不呈球形地|Not in a globular or spherical form.  Describes something that is not round or sphere-shaped.|The protein folded nonglobularly, forming a sheet-like structure.|近义词：asymmetrically, irregularly|反义词:globularly, spherically|词性:副词


ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + globular + -ly.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," "globular" refers to a spherical or globe-like shape, and "-ly" is an adverbial suffix.
