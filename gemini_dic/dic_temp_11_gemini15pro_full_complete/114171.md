The word "mahomentry" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Did you perhaps intend another word like "mahometry"?  If you can clarify the intended word, I can provide a proper analysis.

Assuming you meant "manometry" (which deals with pressure measurement), here's an analysis:

manometry: /məˈnɒmɪtri/ | n. | 测压法; 压力测量 | The measurement of pressure, especially of gases or liquids. | Doctors used manometry to diagnose the patient's esophageal problems. 医生使用测压法诊断病人的食道问题。|  Manometry revealed abnormal pressure readings in the pipes. 测压法显示管道压力读数异常。| synonyms: pressure measurement, pressure testing | antonyms: N/A | noun
