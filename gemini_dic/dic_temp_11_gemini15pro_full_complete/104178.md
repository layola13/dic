Etymology:
From junket (n.) "a sweet custard-like dish," later "a feast, picnic," from Old French jonquette "cream cheese, rush basket," diminutive of jonc "rush," from Latin juncus. The meaning shifted to "pleasure trip, excursion" (1845) because such outings often involved festive meals. The verb sense of "to go on a junket" is from 1884.
