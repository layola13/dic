PHRASE->
1. inwheel motor (轮毂电机)
2. inwheel drive system (轮毂驱动系统)
3. inwheel electric bike (轮毂电机电动自行车)
4. inwheel technology (轮毂技术)
5. inwheel design (轮毂设计)


Etymology: "in" + "wheel". "In" denotes location or position within, while "wheel" refers to the circular object used for rotation and movement. Therefore, "inwheel" literally means "within the wheel".
