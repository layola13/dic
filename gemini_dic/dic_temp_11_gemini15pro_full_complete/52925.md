ETYMOLOGY->
Likely derived from or influenced by Russian димя (dimya), a dialectical variant of имя (imya) meaning "name."  The diminutive suffix -ya reinforces the sense of smallness or insignificance. This etymology is not definitively established, and the word may also be a neologism or slang term.
