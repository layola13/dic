cross-correlation:/ˌkrɒs kɒrəˈleɪʃən/ /ˌkrɔːs kɔːrəˈleɪʃən/ | n. |互相关，交叉相关| A measure of similarity between two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them. It is commonly used to find occurrences of a known waveform within a longer signal. | Example: Cross-correlation is used in signal processing to detect a known signal buried in noise.  互相关用于信号处理中检测被噪声掩盖的已知信号。

Example:  The cross-correlation of the two images revealed the areas of greatest similarity.  两幅图像的互相关揭示了最相似的区域。 | 近义词: correlation | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but conceptually opposite is *decorrelation* or *independence*) | 词性: noun
