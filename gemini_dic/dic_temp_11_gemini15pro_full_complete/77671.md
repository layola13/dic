Etymology->
From *gel*, a back-formation from *gelatin* (itself from French *gélatine*), from Late Latin *gelatina* "jelly, frozen," from *gelatus*, past participle of *gelare* "to freeze," from PIE root *gel- "cold; to freeze."  The sense of "to solidify" arose in the late 19th century, and the figurative sense of "to become cohesive" arose in the mid-20th century.
