disperple:/dɪˈspɜːrpl/ | adj. | 沮丧的，忧郁的 |  Feeling gloomy or disheartened. While not a standard English word, it seems to be a blend of "disperse" and "purple," possibly evoking a sense of scattered or dissipated sadness, like a fading purple hue. |  She felt disperple after hearing the bad news. 她听到坏消息后感到沮丧。  | 近义词: sad, depressed, gloomy, downcast, dejected | 反义词: happy, cheerful, elated, joyful | 词性: 形容词

词源:  A blend (portmanteau) of "disperse" and "purple."  "Disperse" comes from Latin "dispersus," past participle of "dispergere," meaning "to scatter." "Purple" comes from Old English "purpul," ultimately from Latin "purpura."
