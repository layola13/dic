词源:  From Old French *exploreur (Modern French explorateur), from Latin explorator “scout, spy,” agent noun from explorare “search out, investigate, examine,” from ex- “out” + plorare “to cry out, weep, bewail.”  The original sense was "one who searches out or examines," later shifting to "one who travels in search of geographical or scientific information."
