ETYMOLOGY->
"fair-to-middling" originates from the grading of cotton in the 19th century. "Fair" and "middling" were two grades of cotton quality, with "fair" being slightly better. "Fair-to-middling" thus indicated a quality between these two grades, implying average or moderate.  Over time, the term expanded beyond cotton grading to describe anything of average quality.
