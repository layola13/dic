Etymology:  brainlessness is derived from "brainless" + "-ness".  "Brainless" comes from "brain" (Old English *brægen) + "-less" (Old English -lēas).  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "brainlessness" signifies the state or quality of being without brains, either literally or figuratively.
