Etymology:
non- + correlating.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "correlating" is the present participle of the verb "correlate," which means "to have a mutual relationship or connection."  "Correlate" itself comes from the Latin "correlātus," the past participle of "correlāre," meaning "to bring into mutual relation," from "com-" (together) + "relātus" (related).
