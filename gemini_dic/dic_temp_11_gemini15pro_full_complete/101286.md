Etymology:
From "involved" + "-ly."  "Involved" comes from the Old French "envolver" meaning "to wrap up, enfold," ultimately from the Latin "involvere" meaning "to roll in, wrap up." The suffix "-ly" is used to form adverbs from adjectives.

PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases.  "Involvedly" is typically used on its own to modify a verb.)


注意事项:
As "involvedly" is already an adverb, it doesn't form common phrases in the same way that nouns, verbs, or adjectives do.  It's primarily used to describe *how* an action is performed.
