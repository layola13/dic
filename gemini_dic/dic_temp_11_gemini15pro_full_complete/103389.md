jingxing (This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a transliteration of a Chinese word.  Based on pronunciation, it could be several words, but 精心 (jīngxīn) meaning "meticulous" or "elaborate" seems most probable.)

/dʒɪŋˈʃɪŋ/ | adj. | 精心的，细致的，精巧的 | Meticulous, elaborate, painstaking, careful, detailed |  例句：She planned a jingxing birthday party for her son. 她为儿子精心策划了一个生日派对。| 近义词: meticulous, elaborate, painstaking, careful, detailed | 反义词: careless, sloppy, perfunctory | 词性: adjective

/dʒɪŋˈʃɪŋ/ | adv. | 精心地，细致地 | Meticulously, elaborately, painstakingly | 例句：The artist jingxing painted the portrait.  这位艺术家精心绘制了这幅肖像。| 近义词: meticulously, elaborately, painstakingly, carefully | 反义词: carelessly, sloppily | 词性: adverb


词源:  From Mandarin 精心 (jīngxīn), combining 精 (jīng - refined, exquisite) and 心 (xīn - heart, mind).  Therefore, it implies putting one's heart and mind into something, resulting in meticulous and elaborate work.
