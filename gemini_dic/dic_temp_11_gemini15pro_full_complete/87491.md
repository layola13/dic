heterocarpism:/ˌhɛtərəˈkɑːrpɪzəm/| n.|异果性；杂果性|The production of two or more distinctly different types of fruit by a single plant species.|Example 1: Heterocarpism is an interesting adaptation that allows plants to disperse their seeds in various ways. 异果性是一种有趣的适应性，它使植物能够以各种方式传播种子。

Example 2:  The dandelion exhibits heterocarpism, producing both plumed fruits for wind dispersal and heavier fruits that fall near the parent plant. 蒲公英表现出异果性，既产生带羽状物的果实用于风力传播，也产生较重的果实落在母株附近。|近义词:polycarpy (多心皮)|反义词:homocarpism (同果性)|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
