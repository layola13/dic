isotrimorphism:/ˌaɪsoʊˈtrɪmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同质异晶|The ability of two or more substances to crystallize in the same form, even though they are not chemically identical.  It refers to substances that have different chemical compositions but crystallize in the same crystal system and have similar unit cell dimensions, allowing them to form mixed crystals.|Example 1: Calcite and aragonite are a classic example of isotrimorphism, both being forms of calcium carbonate but crystallizing in different systems. 方解石和文石是同质异晶的典型例子，它们都是碳酸钙的形式，但在不同的晶系中结晶。

Example 2: The isotrimorphism of certain minerals allows them to substitute for each other in crystal structures. 某些矿物的同质异晶性允许它们在晶体结构中相互替代。|近义词:polymorphism (in a broader sense)|反义词:N/A|词性:noun
