airfoils:/ˈɛərfɔɪlz/| n. |机翼，翼型|A surface designed to obtain reacting force from the air through which it moves.|The airplane's airfoils were carefully designed to maximize lift. 这架飞机的机翼经过精心设计，以最大限度地提高升力。|近义词：wings, blades, vanes|反义词: (No direct antonym)|名词

词源: air + foil. "Air" refers to the medium through which the airfoil moves, and "foil" originally meant a thin leaf of metal. The combined term signifies a shape designed to interact with air.
