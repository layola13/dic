PHRASE->
(This word is not typically used in set phrases.  It is an adverb describing *how* an action is performed.  It therefore modifies verbs, not forms phrases with other words.)


词源:  From "bad-tempered" + "-ly."  "Bad-tempered" is from "bad" + "tempered."  "Temper" in this sense relates to a person's state of mind or mood, particularly regarding anger.  The suffix "-ly" turns the adjective "bad-tempered" into an adverb.
