注意事项:
The term "Caucasian" has a complex and often contested history, and its use can be problematic due to its association with outdated racial classifications.  It's crucial to be mindful of the potential for misinterpretation or offense when using this term.  More specific and accurate descriptors, such as geographic origin or ethnicity, are often preferred.  "White" is commonly used as a synonym, but it also encompasses a broader range of people and can still be imprecise.
