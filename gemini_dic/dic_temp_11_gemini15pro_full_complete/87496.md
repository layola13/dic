heterocercy:/ˌhɛtərəˈsɜːrsi/ | n. |异尾性 |The condition of having an asymmetrical tail, typically with the vertebral column extending into the upper lobe, as in sharks and some other fishes. |  Sharks exhibit heterocercy, with their upper tail fin lobe being larger than the lower lobe. 鲨鱼表现出异尾性，它们的上尾鳍叶大于下尾鳍叶。

Heterocercy is an adaptation for improved swimming efficiency in these species.  异尾性是这些物种提高游泳效率的一种适应性。 | synonym:  heterocercal tail | antonym: homocercal tail | noun
