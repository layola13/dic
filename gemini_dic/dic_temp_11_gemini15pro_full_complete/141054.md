Over time, it evolved to emphasize the intensity of the following adjective or adverb, especially those expressing negative emotions or undesirable situations. While it can be used with positive words like "happy" or "glad", it often carries a connotation of relief or a sense that the positive feeling is accompanied by some negative aspect or consequence.
