##oxyacetylenes的详细解析单词属性|中文翻译|英文解析|例句|近义词|反义词|词性炔类化合物 | Oxyacetylenes are a class of chemical compounds containing both oxygen and acetylene groups.  These compounds are typically highly reactive due to thepresence of the triple bond in the acetylene group and the electronegativity of oxygen. They are often used in various industrial processes and chemical synthesis.  The specific properties and applications of oxyacetylenes vary greatly depending on the specific structureand substituents present. |  The study focused on the synthesis and reactivity of various substituted oxyacetylenes.  研究集中在各种取代氧乙炔的合成和反应性上。 |  acetylenic oxides (部分近义词，并非完全相同)|  (无明确反义词，取决于语境)| 名词acid." In chemistry, it often indicates the presence of oxygen.$).often discussed in research papers, textbooks, and industrial manuals concerning chemical synthesis, combustion processes, and material science.  Since the specific properties heavily depend on the molecular structure,  general statements about their applications require caution. Certain oxyacetylenes might find uses as:They can serve as building blocks for the creation of complex organic molecules.cutting metals.  The oxyacetylenes themselves might form transiently in this highly energetic process.补充说明：与氧乙炔气体的关系gas ($C_2H_2$), not a specific class of oxyacetylene compounds.
