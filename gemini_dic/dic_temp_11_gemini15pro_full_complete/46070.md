cyclone-separator:/ˈsaɪkloʊn ˌsɛpəˌreɪtər/ | n. | 旋风分离器 | A device that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a gas stream.  It works by spinning the gas stream, causing heavier particles to be thrown outwards against the wall and collected, while the cleaner gas exits through a central outlet. | The cyclone separator efficiently removed dust from the airflow. 旋风分离器有效地清除了气流中的灰尘。 | The factory installed a new cyclone separator to reduce air pollution. 工厂安装了一个新的旋风分离器以减少空气污染。 | synonyms: centrifugal separator, dust collector | antonyms: N/A | noun
