controlments: /kənˈtroʊlmənts/ | n. | 控制，管理（罕用） |  This word is not standard English and rarely used. It seems to be a non-standard plural form of "controlment," which itself is an obsolete or archaic word meaning "the act or power of controlling."  It suggests multiple instances of the act of controlling or things that control.  It's better to use more common words like "controls," "regulations," or "restrictions." |  (Due to its rarity, constructing natural-sounding examples is difficult.  A contrived example could be:) The government implemented several new controlments on imports. 政府对进口实施了几项新的管控措施。 | 近义词: controls, regulations, restrictions, measures | 反义词: freedoms, liberties | 词性: 名词
