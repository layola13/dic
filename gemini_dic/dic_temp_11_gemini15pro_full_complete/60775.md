electrom:/ɪˈlɛktrɒm/ | n. | 电子 | An electron; especially : a free electron.  This term is now largely obsolete, replaced by "electron". |  The electroms flowed through the circuit. (电子流过电路。) (This sentence is technically correct using the obsolete term but would sound unusual today.  It's better to use "electrons".) | 近义词: electron | 反义词: N/A (Electrons don't have a direct opposite.) | noun
