词源:
godfather + -ly

godfather (n.)  late Old English godfæder "male sponsor at baptism," from god + fæder "father."

-ly (suffix)  Old English -lic, from Proto-Germanic *-liko- (source also of Old Saxon -lik, Old Frisian -lik, Old Norse -ligr, Dutch -lijk, Old High German -lih, German -lich, Gothic -leiks), from PIE *-likos, adjectival suffix, from root *-lei- "to stick, adhere" (see -ly (2)).  The suffix produced abstract nouns in Old English (such as freondlic "friendship"). The adverbial use began c. 1200 and gradually reduced the adjectival use to a few words.
