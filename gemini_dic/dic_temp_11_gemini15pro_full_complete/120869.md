ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + bestow (to confer or present).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-" meaning "wrongly, badly, astray," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-" (wrong, different), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*mei-" (to change, go, move).  "Bestow" comes from Middle English "bistowen," from Old English "bestandan" (to place around, supply, give), from "be-" (around, about) + "standan" (to stand).
