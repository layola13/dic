PHRASE->
(Flittiness isn't typically used in set phrases.  It's a descriptive noun used to characterize behavior, rather than forming part of a fixed expression.  Therefore, providing phrases using "flittiness" would sound unnatural. Instead, I'll provide examples of how it can be used within a sentence to describe actions related to common phrase themes.)

1.  Instead of "What's up?", one might say: "Her usual flittiness is on display; she's flitting from one topic to another." (她像往常一样轻浮，从一个话题跳到另一个话题。)

2. Expressing exasperation like "What the hell!": "This flittiness is driving me crazy; can't she be serious for once?" (这种轻浮快把我逼疯了，她就不能认真一次吗？)

3.  Similar to "what if": "What if her flittiness is just a mask for her insecurity?" (如果她的轻浮只是她不安全感的面具呢？)

4.  Instead of "what for":  "I can't understand the reason for this constant flittiness." (我无法理解这种持续轻浮的原因。)

5.  Similar to "no matter what":  "Her flittiness persists, no matter how serious the situation." (无论情况多么严重，她依然轻浮。)
