iess:  (Not a recognized English word)

Since "iess" isn't a standard English word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis. It's possible this is:

1. **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant "less," "lies," or another similar word.  If you can clarify the intended word, I can provide a full analysis.

2. **A technical term or abbreviation:**  It might be specific to a certain field. If you can provide context, I may be able to help.

3. **A neologism or slang:**  New words are created all the time. If it's a recently coined word, it might not be in dictionaries yet.

4. **A proper noun:**  While unlikely, it's possible "iess" is a name or acronym.

**If you meant "less":**

less: /les/ | adj. adv. | 更少的，较少的；更小的，较小的 |  A smaller amount of; not as much. |  I have less money than you. 我比你的钱少。|  He is less intelligent than his sister. 他不如他妹妹聪明。 | 近义词: fewer, smaller, reduced | 反义词: more, greater, larger | 词性: adjective, adverb
