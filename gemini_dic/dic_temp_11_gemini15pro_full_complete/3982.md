Etymology:
From Middle English *agues*, plural of *ague*, from Old French *ague*, from Latin *acuta* (febris) "(sharp fever)," feminine of *acutus* "sharp, pointed," past participle of *acuere* "to sharpen," from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ḱu-rós,* from the root  *h₂ḱeuh₂- "to see, be sharp." The plural form *agues* became standard in English, even when referring to a single instance of the illness.
