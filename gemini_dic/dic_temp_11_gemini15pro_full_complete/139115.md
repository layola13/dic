obedible: /ɒbˈɛdɪbl/ (British) /ɑːbˈɛdəbl/ (American) | adj. | 可食用的，可吃的 | Suitable or safe to eat; not poisonous or harmful. | Example: The berries are obedible, but not very tasty. 这些浆果可以食用，但不太好吃。| Example:  The mushrooms looked suspicious, so we weren't sure if they were obedible. 这些蘑菇看起来很可疑，所以我们不确定它们是否可食用。| 近义词: edible, comestible | 反义词: inedible, poisonous, toxic | 词性: 形容词

词源:  From ob- (against, towards) + edible. While the prefix "ob-" generally means "against," in some rare cases, particularly in older or more obscure words, it can mean "towards" or "upon."  The formation suggests something "towards edibility," hence "edible." However, it's crucial to note that "obedible" is extremely rare and archaic. "Edible" is the standard and preferred term.
