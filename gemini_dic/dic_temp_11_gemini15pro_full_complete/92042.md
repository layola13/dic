hyperphalangism:/ˌhaɪpərˈfæləndʒɪzəm/| n. |多指（趾）症|A congenital anomaly characterized by an increased number of phalanges in the fingers or toes.|Polydactyly is a related condition involving extra fingers or toes, while hyperphalangism refers specifically to extra bones within the digits. For instance, a person might have hyperphalangism in their thumb, resulting in an unusually long and flexible thumb, but not have polydactyly.  This can sometimes be seen in certain whale species.|Synonym: polyphalangism|Antonym: brachydactyly|Noun
