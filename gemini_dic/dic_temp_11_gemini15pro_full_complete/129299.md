"noer" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It is possible that this is:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant another word like "nor," "no," or "ne'er" (poetic contraction of "never").
2. **A technical term or slang:** It could be specific to a certain field or community.
3. **A proper noun:**  It might be a name or place.
4. **A newly coined word:**  New words enter the language all the time.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer more assistance.


However, since the prompt requested a formatted response even for a non-existent word, I will provide an example analysis for the word "nor" which is potentially close to the intended word:

nor:/nɔːr/ | conj. |也不；也不是| Used to introduce a second negative idea, after "neither" or another negative clause. |Neither John nor Mary went to the party.  约翰和玛丽都没去参加聚会。| He doesn't smoke, nor does he drink. 他不抽烟，也不喝酒。|  Synonym: and not | Antonym: or, and | conjunction
