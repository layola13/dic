The clotting process has been ongoing, and fibrin has been accumulating at the wound site. = 凝血过程一直在进行，纤维蛋白一直在伤口部位积聚。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The fibrin quickly formed a clot and stopped the bleeding. = 纤维蛋白迅速形成血块并止住了出血。
The doctor explained that fibrin was essential for blood clotting. = 医生解释说纤维蛋白对血液凝固至关重要。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):

While the surgeon was operating, fibrin was working to control the bleeding. = 当外科医生正在手术时，纤维蛋白正在起作用来控制出血。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
By the time the paramedics arrived, the fibrin had already formed a clot. = 到医护人员到达时，纤维蛋白已经形成了血块。
The patient had lost a lot of blood before the fibrin had sealed the wound. = 在纤维蛋白封闭伤口之前，病人已经失血过多。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The body had been producing fibrin for several minutes before the bleeding finally stopped. = 在出血最终停止之前，身体已经产生纤维蛋白几分钟了。
The clotting mechanism had been working hard, constantly generating fibrin. = 凝血机制一直在努力工作，不断地产生纤维蛋白。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The fibrin will form a clot and prevent further blood loss. = 纤维蛋白将形成血块并防止进一步失血。
The application of pressure will help the fibrin to seal the wound. = 加压将有助于纤维蛋白封闭伤口。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The body will be producing fibrin to heal the wound over the next few days. = 在接下来的几天里，身体将产生纤维蛋白来愈合伤口。
The medication will be preventing the formation of excess fibrin. = 药物将防止过量纤维蛋白的形成。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the fibrin will have formed a stable clot. = 到明天，纤维蛋白将形成一个稳定的血块。
