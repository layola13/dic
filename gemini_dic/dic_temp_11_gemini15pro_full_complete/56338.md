词源:
The term "dogsbody" originated in the 18th century, referring to a ship's cook's assistant who was responsible for less desirable tasks like preparing the ship's biscuits (hardtack), often infested with weevils ("dog biscuits"). Over time, the term evolved to describe anyone who performs menial tasks. "Dogsbodying" is the gerund form of this noun, emphasizing the act of performing such tasks.
