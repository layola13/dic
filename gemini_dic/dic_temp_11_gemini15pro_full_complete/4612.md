alday:  This word doesn't seem to exist in standard English dictionaries.  It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, or a newly coined word.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered it, what you think it might mean), I might be able to offer more help.  For now, I'll analyze a similar-sounding word: "all day."


all day: /ɔːl deɪ/ | adv. | 一整天 | throughout the entire day; from morning to night |  I worked all day. 我工作了一整天。 |  all the day, the whole day |  N/A (Not applicable as "all day" describes duration, not a specific opposite concept) | adverb
