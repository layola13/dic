geogetto:/ˈdʒiːoʊˈɡɛtoʊ/| n.| 地理学家; 地理学爱好者 |A person who studies or is interested in geography.| He's a real geogetto, always pouring over maps. 他是个真正的地图迷，总是对着地图研究。|近义词：geographer, geography enthusiast |反义词: None |词性:noun


Etymology:  A portmanteau of "geo" (from Greek "gē" meaning "earth") and "ghetto" (meaning a section of a city, especially a thickly populated slum area, inhabited by a minority group or groups).  While "ghetto" often carries negative connotations, its use here is likely meant to convey a sense of passionate, almost obsessive, interest in geography, similar to how other hobbies might be described as someone's "ghetto."  Think of it as their "world" or area of expertise.
