PHRASE->

(Since "obscure's" is a possessive and rarely used, common phrases are difficult to construct naturally.  Here are some examples using "obscure" instead, illustrating how the possessive might be employed, albeit awkwardly):

The nature of the obscure's meaning is what's up? 这晦涩含义的本质是什么？ (Awkward - better: What's the nature of the obscure meaning?)

The obscure's complexity is what the hell! 这晦涩的复杂性真是见鬼！（Awkward - better: What the hell is this obscure thing?!)

What if we never understand the obscure's origins? 如果我们永远不理解这晦涩之物的起源怎么办？

We researched the obscure's history, what for? 我们研究了这晦涩之物的历史，是为了什么？

No matter what, the obscure's significance remains elusive. 无论如何，这晦涩之物的意义仍然难以捉摸。


注意事项:

The possessive form "obscure's" is grammatically correct, but rarely used in practice. It's often more natural to rephrase the sentence using "of the obscure" or similar constructions.
