emphyteusis:/ˌɛmfɪˈtjuːsɪs/
n.
永佃权; 长期租赁权
A long-term lease of land or property, typically for agricultural purposes, where the tenant (emphyteuta) has extensive rights and obligations similar to ownership, but does not actually own the land.  The tenant pays a fixed annual rent (canon) and can improve the property, but cannot alienate it without the owner's consent.
Emphyteusis allows long-term stability for the tenant and ensures that the land is maintained and improved. The owner receives a steady income stream and retains ultimate ownership.
例句：The farmer held the land under emphyteusis, allowing him to cultivate it for generations.  农民以永佃权持有土地，这使他能够耕种几代人。

例句：Emphyteusis provided a secure form of land tenure in many historical legal systems. 在许多历史法律体系中，永佃权提供了一种安全的土地保有形式。

近义词：leasehold, tenancy, long-term lease
反义词：freehold, ownership
