ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *alcyon*, from Greek *alkyōn*, literally "kingfisher".  In Greek mythology, Alcyone was the daughter of Aeolus, the god of the winds.  When her husband Ceyx drowned, she threw herself into the sea.  The gods transformed them both into kingfishers.  It was believed that these birds nested on the sea during the winter solstice, calming the waves for seven days before and after.  This period became known as the "halcyon days," a time of peace and tranquility.
