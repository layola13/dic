conversive:/kənˈvɜːrsɪv/ | adj. |  可逆的，可交换的，可倒置的 | Relating to or denoting a logical relation such that if the relation holds between A and B, it also holds between B and A. | If A implies B, and B also implies A, then the relationship between A and B is conversive. 如果A蕴含B，并且B也蕴含A，那么A和B之间的关系是可逆的。| The statement "if it is a square, it has four sides" is conversive with "if it has four sides, it is a square". 陈述“如果它是一个正方形，它就有四条边”与“如果它有四条边，它就是一个正方形”是可逆的。 | reciprocal, interchangeable | non-conversive | adjective
