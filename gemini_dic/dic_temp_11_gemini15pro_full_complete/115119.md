词源: From "mangle" (v.) + "-ly" (adv. suffix). "Mangle" comes from Old French "mangonel" (a war machine for throwing stones), which itself derives from Latin "manganum" (a kind of catapult), ultimately from Greek "manganon" (an engine of war). The meaning shifted from "to tear or crush with a machine" to "to mutilate or damage severely," and then to the more general sense of "to spoil or ruin."
