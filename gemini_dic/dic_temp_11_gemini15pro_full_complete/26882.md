英文解析: "Cakewalk" originally referred to a pre-Civil War dance performed by enslaved African Americans, often judged by slave owners, with the prize of a cake awarded to the best dancers. The term evolved to mean something easily achieved, perhaps mocking the perceived simplicity of the dance by those who did not perform it.  Over time, the negative connotations have lessened, but the implication of unearned success or effortless achievement often remains, especially when used as "cakewalker."
