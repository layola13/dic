Etymology:
* non- :  Latin prefix meaning "not".
* temperate : From Latin temperatus, past participle of temperare "to moderate, regulate, qualify," from tempus "time, season."  The sense evolution is from "mixing properly," to "observing proper measure," to "moderate."
* -ness : Old English -nes(s), forming abstract nouns from adjectives and participles, from Proto-Germanic *-nassu-, *-nissi- (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian -nissi, Dutch -nis, Old High German -nissi, German -nis, Gothic -inassus).
