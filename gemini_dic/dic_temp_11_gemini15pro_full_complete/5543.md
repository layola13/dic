alphol:/ˈælfɒl/ | n. | α-醇; α-羟基醛 | An aldehyde bearing a hydroxyl group on the alpha carbon atom.  It is an unstable species that readily tautomerizes to its keto form. | Alphols are important intermediates in organic synthesis, though they are rarely isolated due to their instability.  α-醇是有机合成中的重要中间体，尽管由于其不稳定性很少被分离出来。| Synonym: alpha-hydroxyaldehyde | Antonym: N/A | noun
