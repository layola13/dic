ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "jambe" meaning "leg," ultimately from a Vulgar Latin word *gamba, related to Greek "kampē" meaning "bend, curve." The architectural sense developed from the notion of supporting posts resembling legs. The sense of "difficulty" or "tight spot" arose from the image of being stuck or wedged as if between legs or posts.
