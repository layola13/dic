chiral: /ˈkaɪrəl/ | adj. | 手性的，不对称的 | Relating to or characterized by chirality; asymmetric in such a way that the structure and its mirror image are not superimposable. |  Many biological molecules are chiral. 许多生物分子是手性的。

The chiral drug was more effective than its racemic mixture.  这种手性药物比它的外消旋混合物更有效。| 近义词: asymmetric, dissymmetric | 反义词: achiral, symmetric | 词性: 形容词
