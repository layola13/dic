词源:  "Docon" is likely a shortened, informal form of "document," influenced by slang and colloquial speech. There's no official etymological record for this specific shortened form, as it's considered informal usage.  It shares its root with "document," which ultimately comes from the Latin "documentum," meaning "proof" or "lesson."
