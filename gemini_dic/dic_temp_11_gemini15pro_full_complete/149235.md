##oxysalt 的详细解析/ | n. | 氧盐 |  A salt containing oxygen as partof an acid radical.  | Example: Sodium sulfate ($Na_2SO_4$) is an oxysalt. 硫酸钠($Na_2SO_4$)是一种氧盐。| 近义词：oxygenated salt (较少使用) | 反义词：无 (无直接反义词，可考虑与非氧盐进行对比)of oxygen in acids) and "-salt" (referring to a chemical compound formed by the reaction of an acid and a base).  The "oxy-" prefix points to the crucial role of oxygen in the formation of these salts.The term reflects the historical understanding of acids and salts, where oxygen's presence was linked to acidity. While this view is somewhat outdated in modern chemistry, the term remains in use to describe salts deriving from oxyacids.an oxyacid (an acid containing oxygen) and a base.  The general reaction can be represented as:acid, $H_2SO_4$, nitric acid, $HNO_3$)sulfate, $Na_2SO_4$, potassium nitrate, $KNO_3$)These salts are widespread in both natural and synthetic materials.  Many common minerals are oxysalts, and they play important roles in various industrial applications and biological processes.  For example, many fertilizers contain oxysalts like phosphates and nitrates, and numerous industrial chemicals are also oxysalts.. Many common minerals, such as sulfates and carbonates, are examples of oxysalts.  许多常见的矿物，例如硫酸盐和碳酸盐，都是氧盐的例子。盐的形成涉及到含氧酸和碱之间的中和反应。a wide range of ionic compounds, emphasizing the crucial role of oxygen in their structure and formation. Understanding oxysalts helps in comprehending acid-base reactions and the properties of various inorganic compounds.
