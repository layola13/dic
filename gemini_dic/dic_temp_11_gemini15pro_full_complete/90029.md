注意事项:
Since "hoshima" is a proper noun (specifically a Japanese surname or place name) and not a common English word, it does not have varied grammatical forms or tenses in English. Its usage is primarily limited to noun form.  Its meaning is derived from the Japanese words "hoshi" (star) and "shima" (island).
