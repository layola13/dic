词性: verb

词源: From Late Latin *exauguratus, past participle of *exaugurare "to consecrate with solemn rites," from Latin ex- "out, from" + augurari "to predict, foretell," from augur "soothsayer."  The meaning shifted to "increase, enlarge" in post-classical Latin, probably influenced by the meaning of augere "to increase, enlarge."
