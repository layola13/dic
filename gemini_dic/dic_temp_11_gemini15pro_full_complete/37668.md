compactification:/kəmˌpæktɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 紧致化，压实 | The process of making something compact or denser; the result of such a process.  In mathematics, it refers to the construction of a compact topological space from a non-compact one. | The compactification of the soil improved its drainage. 土壤的压实改善了其排水性。 | synonyms: compression, condensation, consolidation | antonyms: expansion, decompression, rarefaction | noun


compactification:/kəmˌpæktɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 致密化 |  In physics, especially string theory, it refers to the idea that some spatial dimensions are "curled up" and small, thus not directly observable. | String theory uses compactification to explain the unseen dimensions.  弦理论用致密化来解释看不见的维度。 | synonyms: reduction, shrinking, miniaturization | antonyms: expansion, enlargement | noun
