bigly:/ˈbɪɡli/ | adv. |  很大地，非常地 |  Although considered nonstandard by many, "bigly" is used as an adverb to emphasize size or extent. It gained notoriety through its use by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. |  "I'm going to win bigly." 我会大获全胜。(非标准用法) | 近义词: greatly, hugely, enormously | 反义词: slightly, minimally | 词性: 副词

词源:  "Bigly" is formed by adding the adverbial suffix "-ly" to the adjective "big." While it has archaic roots (appearing in some 19th-century texts), its modern usage is largely attributed to Donald Trump, though he may have intended to say "big league."
