词源:  The word "overcontrolled" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and the past participle of the verb "control" (meaning "to exercise restraint or direction over").  The prefix "over-" is of Germanic origin, while "control" comes from Old French "controle" (a duplicate register used to verify accounts).
