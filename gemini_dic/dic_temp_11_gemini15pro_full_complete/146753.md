词源:
From over- + humbleness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much". "Humbleness" is derived from the adjective "humble," ultimately from Latin "humilis" meaning "low, lowly, humble," from "humus" meaning "ground, earth."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.
