词源：Both "brooch" and "broche" ultimately derive from the Old French word "broche," meaning "spit" or "pointed instrument." The word is related to the verb "brocher," meaning "to prick" or "to stitch."  Over time, the word developed two distinct meanings and spellings in English. "Brooch" refers to the ornamental jewelry item, while "broche" refers to the cooking utensil.
