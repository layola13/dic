词源:
"in-reason" is formed from "in" (meaning "within") and "reason" (meaning "the power of the mind to think, understand, and form judgments logically").  It's a somewhat archaic term, not frequently used in modern English, but understandable in context.  Its structure is similar to other words like "in-kind" (paid in goods or services rather than money).
