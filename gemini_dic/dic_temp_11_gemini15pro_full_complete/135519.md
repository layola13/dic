Etymology->
From non- + plausibly.  Non- is a prefix meaning "not," and plausibly comes from plausible, meaning "seeming reasonable or probable." Plausible itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "plaudere," meaning "to applaud" or "to clap," suggesting something that is agreeable or acceptable.
