注意事项:  "Non-Moslem" is an older and less common term than "non-Muslim".  While both technically mean the same thing, "non-Muslim" is the preferred and more respectful term in modern usage. Using "non-Moslem" can be perceived as outdated or even slightly offensive by some.  It is generally recommended to use "non-Muslim" instead.
