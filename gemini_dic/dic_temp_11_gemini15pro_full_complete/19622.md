词源:

From bigwig + -ed + -ness + -es (plural).  "Bigwig" itself originates from the large wigs formerly worn by people of importance, particularly judges and barristers.  The suffix "-ed" creates an adjective, "-ness" transforms it into a noun denoting a state or quality, and "-es" marks the plural.
