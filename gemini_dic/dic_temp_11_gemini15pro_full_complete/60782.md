electromatic:/ɪˌlɛktroʊˈmætɪk/| adj.|电磁的；电动化的|Relating to or operated by electromagnetism or electricity, often implying automation or advanced technology.|例句：He played an electromatic guitar. 他弹奏了一把电吉他。

例句：The electromatic doors opened automatically. 电动门自动打开了。|近义词：electric, electronic, automated|反义词：manual, mechanical|词性：形容词

词源:

"Electro-" comes from the Greek "ēlektron," meaning "amber." Amber was one of the first substances observed to exhibit electrical properties when rubbed.

"-magnetic" refers to magnetism, the force exerted by magnets.

The combined form "electromatic" thus refers to the relationship or interaction between electricity and magnetism.
