ETYMOLOGY->
From French *cantilever* (now *poutre en porte-à-faux*), from *cant* "corner, angle" + *lever* "to raise."  The *cant* element is related to the Italian *canto* "side, corner," and ultimately from Latin *cantus* "edge, border."  The *lever* element is from Latin *levare* "to raise," related to *levis* "light."
