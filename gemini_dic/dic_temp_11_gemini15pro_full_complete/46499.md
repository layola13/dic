ETYMOLOGY->
From "dairy" + "-ing."  "Dairy" comes from Middle English *deirie*, from Old English *daege*, meaning "kneader of dough, dairymaid." This ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic *daigwaz*, meaning "dough." The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun "dairy" into a gerund or present participle, indicating the act or process of engaging in dairy-related activities.
