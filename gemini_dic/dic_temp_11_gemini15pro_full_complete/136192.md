nonrelativities:/ˌnɒnˌrɛləˈtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 非相对性；非相对论效应 |  The study of nonrelativities is important in classical mechanics. |  Scientists are exploring the nonrelativities of slow-moving objects. | 近义词: classical mechanics concepts | 反义词: relativistic effects | 词性: 名词

词源:  "Nonrelativities" is derived from "nonrelativity," which is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "relativity." "Relativity" itself comes from the Late Latin word "relativus," meaning "having relation or reference."  The suffix "-ities" makes it plural.
