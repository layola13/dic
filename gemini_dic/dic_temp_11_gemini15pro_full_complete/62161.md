词源:  "Encoach" is a back-formation from the noun "coach."  While "coach" itself has a rich etymology originating from the Hungarian town of Kocs, known for its horse-drawn carriages, "encoach" is a more recent creation, formed by adding the prefix "en-" to the noun "coach" to create a verb.  This process is analogous to the formation of verbs like "encircle" or "encase."
