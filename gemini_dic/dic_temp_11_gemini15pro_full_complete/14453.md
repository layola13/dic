词源: From Anglo-French *availer, from a- (from Latin ad 'to, towards') + vail-, variant stem of valer 'to be strong, be of use' (from Latin valēre).

注意事项: "Avail yourselves of" is a rather formal and somewhat archaic expression.  While grammatically correct, it's less common in modern English and often replaced by simpler phrasing like "use" or "take advantage of."  It is typically used in more formal contexts or when addressing a group of people.
