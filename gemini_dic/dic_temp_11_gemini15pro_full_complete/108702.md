ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "lean in" which literally means to incline the body forward.  Figuratively, it gained popularity through Sheryl Sandberg's book "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead" where it represents actively pursuing one's ambitions, particularly in a career context.  源于动词短语“lean in”，字面意思是身体前倾。比喻义上，它因谢丽尔·桑德伯格的著作《向前一步：女性，工作及领导意志》而流行起来，代表积极追求个人抱负，尤其是在职业背景下。
