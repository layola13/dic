apatheias:/ˌæpəˈθiːəz/| n. | 冷漠，无兴趣，无动于衷|This word appears to be a non-standard pluralization of "apathy." While "apathies" is occasionally used, "apatheias" is not commonly accepted. The standard singular form is "apathy," meaning a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern.  | Due to the non-standard nature of "apatheias," providing a natural-sounding example sentence is difficult.  A more acceptable phrasing would use "apathy" or "apathies."  For example: "The apathies of the citizens allowed corruption to flourish." |Near synonyms: indifference, listlessness, lethargy|Antonyms:  interest, enthusiasm, passion, zeal|noun
