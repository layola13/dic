Etymology->

From a- + swoon.  The prefix "a-" in this context means "in a state of" or "on the way to".  "Swoon" itself comes from Old English *geswōgen, past participle of *swōgan "to suffocate, stifle". The original sense was thus "in a state of being suffocated".  Over time, the meaning shifted to its current sense of ecstatic faintness.
