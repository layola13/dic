aragonite:/ˈærəɡəˌnaɪt/| n. |文石，霰石|A mineral form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3, crystallizing in the orthorhombic system. It is less stable than calcite, into which it changes over time.| Aragonite is a polymorph of calcite, meaning they have the same chemical formula but different crystal structures. 文石是方解石的多形体，意味着它们具有相同的化学式但不同的晶体结构。

The aragonite sand on the beaches of the Bahamas is renowned for its brilliant white color. 巴哈马群岛海滩上的文石沙以其亮丽的白色而闻名。|近义词：calcite 方解石|反义词:  (No direct antonym as it's a specific mineral) |词性:noun
