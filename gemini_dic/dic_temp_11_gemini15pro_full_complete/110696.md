linearensate:/ˌlɪniərˈɛnseɪt/ | adj. | 线状聚伞花序的 | Having flowers arranged in a linear cyme. A cyme is a type of inflorescence (flower cluster) where the main stem ends in a flower, and further flowers develop on lateral branches. In a linear cyme, these lateral branches and flowers are arranged along a more or less straight line. | The plant's linearensate inflorescence made it easy to identify.  这种植物的线状聚伞花序使其易于识别。|  The botanist noted the linearensate structure of the flower cluster.  植物学家注意到花簇的线状结构。 |  近义词:secund (单侧的), racemose (总状的) | 反义词: corymbose (伞房花序的), paniculate (圆锥花序的) | 词性: 形容词


词源:

linearensate 由 linear (线的，线形的) + ensate (剑形的，像剑的) 组合而成。 "linear" 源自拉丁语 "linearis,"  意为"属于一条线"。 "ensate" 源自拉丁语 "ensis," 意为"剑"。  虽然 "ensate"  通常指叶子的形状，但在 "linearensate" 中，它与 "linear" 结合，描述了花序的线形排列。
