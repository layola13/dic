ETYMOLOGY->
From Scots *hindber, variant of *hinber, from Old English *hindberie (attested in place names like Hindberie, now Hindlip, Worcestershire), from hind + berie (“berry”). Cognate with Middle Low German hīnber(e) (“raspberry”).  The word "hind" refers to a female red deer, possibly because the berries grow in areas where deer roam.
