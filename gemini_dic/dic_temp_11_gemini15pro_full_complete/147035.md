ETYMOLOGY->

From *over* + *lave*, from Old English *lāfian* "to wash, bathe," related to *lyft* "air, sky"  (the idea being to purify with water or air). The sense of "to extend over and cover a part of" developed from the idea of waves washing over each other.  Note: The word "overlave" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  "Overlap" is the preferred term.
