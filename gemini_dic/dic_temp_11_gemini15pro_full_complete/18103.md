PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases)


词源: From be- + head + -ed.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "to make" or "to cause to be."  "Head" refers to the top part of the body.  "-ed" is a suffix used to form the past participle of verbs. Therefore, "beheaded" literally means "caused to be without a head."
