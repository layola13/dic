ETYMOLOGY->
From French *libertin*, from Latin *lībērtīnus* (“freedman”, literally “belonging to a freedman”), from *līber* (“free”).  Originally referred to freed slaves in ancient Rome, later came to mean a freethinker (often with implications of unorthodoxy or heresy), and eventually evolved to its current meaning of someone unrestrained by morality, especially sexually.
