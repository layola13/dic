注意事项:

* "Koo" is slang and informal, primarily used in online contexts and certain subcultures.  It's a deliberate misspelling of "cool."
* While it can function as an adjective, it's most commonly used as an interjection or exclamation to express approval or admiration for something considered fashionable or trendy.  Consider the context before using it, as it might not be appropriate in formal settings.
