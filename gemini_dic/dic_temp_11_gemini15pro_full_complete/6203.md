PHRASE->
anmonia solution 氨溶液
anmonia water 氨水
liquid ammonia 液氨

词源：
From French *ammoniaque, from Medieval Latin *sal ammoniacus (“salt of Ammon”), referring to ammonium chloride, first obtained near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon in ancient Libya.


注意事项:  “ammonias” 虽然在语法上是复数形式，但氨作为一种化学物质，通常使用单数形式 “ammonia”。  使用复数形式的情况非常少见，可能指的是不同类型的氨化合物或溶液，但即使在这种情况下，使用更具体的术语（例如 "different ammonia solutions"）通常更清晰。
