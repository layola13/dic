ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *furs*, plural of *fur*, from Old French *fur*, *forre*, from Frankish *fōdr*, *fōter*, from Proto-Germanic *fōdrą* (compare West Frisian *fûdder*, Dutch *voeder*, German *Futter* (“lining, case”)), from Proto-Indo-European *pṓds* (“foot”).  The original meaning was "sheath, scabbard." The sense transfer to animal hide likely occurred through the use of furs as linings.
