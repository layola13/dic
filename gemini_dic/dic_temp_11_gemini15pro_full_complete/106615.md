注意事项:

词源: Hungarian.  "kulacs" is a Hungarian word and has no direct English equivalent, although "water bottle," "flask," or "thermos" are often used to translate it.

Since the word is borrowed directly from Hungarian, it retains its original pronunciation and is considered a noun in English usage as well.
