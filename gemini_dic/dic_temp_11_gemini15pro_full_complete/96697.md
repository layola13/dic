ineffabilities:/ˌɪnɛfəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 不可言喻的事物；难以表达的事物 | The ineffabilities of mystical experience are difficult to convey in words. |  Mystical experiences are full of ineffabilities, things that cannot be expressed in ordinary language. | 近义词: inexpressibilities, unutterables | 反义词: expressible things, describable things | 词性: noun (plural)

词源: From ineffable (incapable of being expressed in words) + -ity (forming abstract nouns) + -ies (plural suffix).  The root "effable" comes from Latin "effabilis" (speakable), from "ex-" (out) + "fari" (to speak).  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning.
