ETYMOLOGY->
From "checklist" + "-ing"
"Checklist" is a compound of "check" (from Old French "eschec," meaning "check" in chess, ultimately from Persian "shah," meaning "king") + "list" (from Old English "list," meaning "border, strip").  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun "checklist" into a gerund or present participle, indicating the action or process.
