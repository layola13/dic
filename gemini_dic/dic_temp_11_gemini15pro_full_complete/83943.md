词源:  The term originates from the mechanism of firearms, specifically flintlock weapons.  When the hammer is pulled back only halfway, the gun is primed to fire but not fully cocked, making it prone to accidental discharge.  This literal meaning then extended figuratively to describe any state of incomplete preparation.
