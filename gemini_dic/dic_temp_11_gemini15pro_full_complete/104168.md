Etymology:
From juniper + -in.  Juniper comes from Old French *juniperus (compare modern French genièvre), from Latin juniperus, perhaps a compound of *junior (younger) + *parus (producing), referring to the way the young berries appear alongside the older ones.  The suffix -in denotes a substance derived from something.
