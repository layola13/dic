##pangeometry 的详细解析mətri/ | n. | 全几何学 |  泛几何学；所有几何学的总称  | Pangeometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of all geometries, including Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometries.  | 近义词：universal geometry (通用几何学) | 反义词：无less frequently encountered than its constituent components, refers to the overarching study encompassing all geometries. Unlike Euclidean geometry, which operates under specific axioms (e.g., parallel postulate), pangeometry seeks to identify common properties and relationships among diverse geometric systems. This might include exploring how different geometries, like spherical geometry or hyperbolic geometry, relate to each other and what overarching principles govern them.  It delves into the meta-level aspects of geometric systems, looking for unifying frameworks or theorems applicableacross various models. The field is inherently complex and draws from topology, differential geometry, and other advanced mathematical areas. The exploration of pangeometry pushes the boundaries of geometrical understanding beyond traditional Euclidean confines and seeks common threads in what may seem like disparate systems.is a combination of "pan-" (meaning "all" or "entire") and "geometry."  Therefore, its etymological roots directly reflect its definition – the study of all geometries.the foundations and principles of geometry. It wouldn't typically appear in everyday conversation or general scientific writing.  Its application is mainly within academic papers, treatises, and specialized texts on geometry, topology, and related fields.  Research into pangeometry is often theoretical, striving to find overarching principles and frameworks.例句:**行输运的概念对于理解泛几何学至关重要。)等同。  而由于没有明确的与其相对立的概念，因此没有合适的反义词。
