proof: from Old French preuve "proof, evidence," from Latin proba "proof," from probare "to test, inspect, examine, approve of," from probus "good, honest," from PIE root *pro- "forward," hence "in front of," also "before," thus "older," hence "of great age, noble"

-ed: past participle ending, forming adjectives meaning "having been subjected to the action of the verb."
