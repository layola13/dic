noun
截线, 切除术, (数学)无理数
A quantity or magnitude that, when subtracted from a rational quantity, leaves as a remainder a quantity that is irrational with respect to the whole; an irrational remainder left after subtraction.  In geometry, it's a line segment formed by cutting off from a given line a smaller segment.  In older medical texts, it can also refer to a cutting off or excision.
