Etymology:
"nonegregiousness" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "egregiousness". "Egregious" comes from the Latin word "egregius," meaning "outstanding" or "distinguished," originally in a positive sense. Over time, it took on a negative connotation, meaning "conspicuously bad."  Therefore, "nonegregiousness" signifies the lack of egregiousness, meaning not conspicuously bad, ordinary, or unremarkable.
