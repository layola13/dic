Etymology:
non- (prefix) + variably (adverb)
  * non-:  a prefix meaning "not," freely used as an English formative, usually with adjectives or their derivative adverbs and nouns (non-Christian; nonprofessional).  From Latin non "not," from Old Latin noenum, related to ne "not" and oinom/unum "one."  The form non- appears before vowels or h; before other consonants, usually no-.
  * variably:  in a variable manner; not consistently.  From variable + -ly.
    * variable:  apt or liable to vary or change; changeable. From Late Latin variabilis "changeable," from Latin variare "to change, alter, make different," related to varius "various."
    * -ly: adverb-forming suffix
