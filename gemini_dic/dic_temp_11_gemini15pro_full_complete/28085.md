capillary: /ˈkæpɪˌleri/ (US), /kəˈpɪləri/ (UK) | n. adj. | 毛细血管；毛细管；微血管 | A tiny blood vessel that connects the smallest arteries to the smallest veins, allowing the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and tissues.  Also refers to a tube with a very small internal diameter. |  The capillaries are so small that red blood cells must pass through them single file. 毛细血管非常细小，以至于红细胞必须一个接一个地通过。| The ink flowed up the capillary tube by capillary action. 墨水通过毛细管作用流到毛细管中。 | synonyms:  arteriole, venule,  microvessel | antonyms: artery, vein | noun, adjective


capillary: /ˈkæpɪˌleri/ (US), /kəˈpɪləri/ (UK) | adj. | 毛细作用的；毛细管的 | Relating to or involving capillaries or capillary action. | The capillary action of the sponge soaked up the spilled water. 海绵的毛细作用吸收了溢出的水。| Capillary tubes are used in various scientific experiments. 毛细管用于各种科学实验。| synonyms:  fine, hair-like, minute | antonyms: wide, large | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *capillāris, from Latin capillus (“hair”), from Proto-Italic *kapillos, from Proto-Indo-European *kap- (“head, top”).  The term is used because of the resemblance of capillaries to fine hairs.
