词源： "Matavas" is likely derived from Lithuanian "matuoti" (to measure) and "vysti" (to wither), suggesting someone who measures (targets) and causes to wither (kills).  However, this is speculative and requires further etymological research to confirm.  It is often associated with historical Lithuanian assassins.  Some sources suggest a connection to the Hebrew word "metevel," meaning "destroyer."  The etymology is complex and not definitively settled.
