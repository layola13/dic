Etymology: From Middle French *melant, present participle of melancolier (“to make melancholic”), from melancolie (“melancholy”), from Late Latin melancholia, from Ancient Greek μελαγχολία (melankholía, “black bile, melancholy”), from μέλας (mélas, “black, dark”) + χολή (kholḗ, “bile”). The sense shifted from the physiological (an excess of black bile was believed to cause melancholy) to the psychological.
