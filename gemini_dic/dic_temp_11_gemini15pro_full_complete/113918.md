maegbote is not a recognized English word.  It may be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Since it isn't a standard English word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you can provide more context (like where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer more insights.


If you meant "maybe" (perhaps this was a typo), here's the analysis:

maybe: /ˈmeɪbi/ | adv. | 也许，可能 | perhaps; possibly | Maybe I'll go to the party. 也许我会去参加派对。| Maybe we should try a different approach. 也许我们应该尝试不同的方法。|Synonyms: perhaps, possibly, perchance | Antonyms: certainly, definitely | adverb
