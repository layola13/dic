ETYMOLOGY->
From cloy (v.), from Anglo-Norman encloyer "to clog, obstruct," from Old French encloer (Modern French enclouer), from en- "in" + clou "nail" (from Latin clavus).  The sense development from "clog" to "satiate, surfeit" to "disgust" likely occurred through the notion of being overly full or obstructed.
