PHRASE->
(The word "gil" doesn't have common set phrases like "what's up" or "what if".  It's primarily a noun meaning either "gill" of a fish or, informally, "girl". So phrases wouldn't be directly related to the word itself but rather how the noun is used in a sentence.  Therefore, providing general phrases related to "what" isn't applicable here.)
