mesothelium:/ˌmɛzəˈθiːliəm/ | n. | 间皮 |  A membrane composed of a single layer of flattened cells that forms the lining of several body cavities: the pleura (lining of the lungs and chest wall), peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity), pericardium (lining of the heart), and internal reproductive organs. | The mesothelium secretes a lubricating fluid that allows organs to move smoothly against each other.  间皮分泌一种润滑液，使器官能够相互顺畅地移动。|  The mesothelial cells play a role in transport, inflammation, and tissue repair. 间皮细胞在运输、炎症和组织修复中发挥作用。 | synonym: serosa (though not strictly synonymous, as serosa refers to the membrane itself while mesothelium refers to the cellular layer of that membrane) | antonym:  N/A (there's no direct opposite of a specific tissue type) | noun
