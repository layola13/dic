"non-" is a prefix meaning "not."
"disastrous" comes from the Old French word "desastre," meaning "ill-starred," ultimately from the Italian word "disastro," from "dis-" (meaning "bad") + "astro" (meaning "star").
"-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
