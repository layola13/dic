词源:
The term "greenhorn" originated in the 15th century, referring to young animals with newly grown horns, particularly oxen or cattle.  The horns were green because they were young and hadn't been exposed to the elements long enough to harden and darken. The term was later applied to inexperienced soldiers, sailors, and settlers in the American West, eventually becoming a general term for anyone new or unskilled in a particular activity.
