词源:
From ginger (n.) + -ly (adv. suffix).  The original sense was "sprightly, lively," from the notion of "having ginger," referring to the spice's invigorating qualities.  This sense evolved to "daintily, elegantly," perhaps because of the association with delicate movements, and then to "cautiously."
