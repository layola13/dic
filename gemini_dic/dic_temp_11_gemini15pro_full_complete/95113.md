PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Inanimately" is an adverb and doesn't typically form set phrases.  It modifies verbs, describing *how* an action is performed, rather than forming a distinct unit of meaning with other words.


词源：From Latin *inanimatus* "lifeless," from *in-* "not" + *animatus* "animate," past participle of *animare* "to give life to," from *anima* "breath, soul."
