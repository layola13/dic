erythrogranulose:/ɪˌrɪθroʊˈɡrænjuːloʊs/
n. |嗜酸性颗粒|A substance found in the cytoplasm of some cells, particularly neutrophils, consisting of granules that stain red with eosin.  These granules contain various enzymes and proteins involved in immune responses.|The presence of erythrogranulose in the neutrophils suggests an active infection.| 近义词: azurophil granule (partially)|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

Etymology:
erythro- (from Greek erythros, meaning "red") + granulo- (from Latin granulum, meaning "small grain") + -ose (suffix forming adjectives and nouns relating to carbohydrates and other substances)
