jesuitess:/ˈdʒɛzʊɪtɛs/ | n. | 女耶稣会士 | A female member of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).  This term is not officially used by the Catholic Church, as the Jesuits are a male-only order. |  There are no legitimate examples, as "Jesuitess" is not a recognized term.  A sentence using the word would be grammatically correct but factually incorrect, e.g., "The Jesuitess worked at the mission." | Near synonyms: (none, due to the inaccurate nature of the word)  One might use "female religious" or "nun" as a very broad comparison but it's not accurate. | Antonyms: (none, due to the inaccurate nature of the word) | Noun
