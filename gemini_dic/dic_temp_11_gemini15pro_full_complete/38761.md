ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "condone," which comes from the Latin "condonare," meaning "to give wholly, pardon, remit."  "Con-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "completely," and "donare" means "to give."  So, the original meaning was to completely give something away, in this case, a debt or an offense.
