词源:  "otalgic" likely comes from "otalgy," a now-rare synonym for nostalgia. "Nostalgia" itself comes from the Greek "nostos" (return home) and "algos" (pain, grief).  "Otalgy" seems to have formed similarly, perhaps using "otus" (ear) in place of "nostos", possibly evoking the idea of sounds or music triggering memories and nostalgic feelings.  However, this is speculative as "otalgy" is poorly attested and its etymology is uncertain.  It's plausible "otalgic" arose as a back-formation from "otalgia" (earache), influenced by "nostalgia".
