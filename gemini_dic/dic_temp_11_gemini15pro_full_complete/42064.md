词源:  "Coten" isn't a standard English word. It seems to be a  misspelling or variant of "cotton" (referring to the plant or its fibers) or possibly a dialectal or archaic word related to "coating" or "cover."  If aiming for "cotton," the origin is from the Old French "coton," ultimately from Arabic "qutn." If related to "coating," it likely shares a root with "coat," from Old French "cote," of Germanic origin.
