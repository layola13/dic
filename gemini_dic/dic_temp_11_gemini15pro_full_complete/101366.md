ionized:/ˈaɪəˌnaɪzd/ | adj. | 电离的，离子化的 | Converted into ions; having lost or gained electrons, thus acquiring an electrical charge. | The ionized gas glowed brightly. 电离的气体发出明亮的光芒。 | The ionized air crackled with energy. 电离的空气发出噼啪的能量声。 | 近义词: charged, electrolytic | 反义词: neutral, non-ionized | 词性:形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From ion + -ize + -ed.  "Ion" comes from the Greek word "iōn," meaning "going," referring to the movement of charged particles. "-ize" is a suffix forming verbs meaning "to cause to be or become," and "-ed" is the past participle suffix.
