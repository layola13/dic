ETYMOLOGY->

From "muck rake," a rake for scraping up manure, used figuratively by President Theodore Roosevelt in a 1906 speech to criticize journalists who focused on the negative aspects of American life.  The term comes from John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress* (1678), where a character is so preoccupied with raking muck that he fails to see a celestial crown offered to him.  Roosevelt's use of the term popularized it in its modern meaning.
