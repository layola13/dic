jvm:/ˈdʒeɪ viː ɛm/| n.|Java虚拟机|Java Virtual Machine, a program that allows Java applications to run on any operating system.|Example: The JVM interprets Java bytecode and translates it into instructions that the underlying operating system can understand.  Java虚拟机解释Java字节码并将其转换为底层操作系统可以理解的指令。

Example: Different operating systems have different JVMs, allowing Java programs to be platform-independent. 不同的操作系统有不同的JVM，允许Java程序独立于平台。|近义词:Java runtime environment (JRE)|反义词:N/A|noun
