词源: From mistress + -ly.  "Mistress" originally meant a woman who is head of a household or has authority or control, but it later gained the connotation of a woman in a position of power over others, and eventually, a woman in an extramarital relationship with a man.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun into an adjective.
