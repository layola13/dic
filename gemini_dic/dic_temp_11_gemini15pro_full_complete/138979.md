ETYMOLOGY->
The word "nylon" is a genericized trademark coined by DuPont. Its origin is obscure, with various theories proposed. One theory suggests it's an arbitrary combination of letters.  Another suggests a blend of "New York" and "London."  A more whimsical theory claims it stands for "Now You Lose, Old Nippon," referencing competition with the Japanese silk industry, though this is generally dismissed as a backronym.
