ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *areer (Modern French arréer), from Vulgar Latin *ad-retare, from Latin ad- "to" + retare "to reckon, account".  Originally meant "to set in order, arrange". The meaning shifted to "dress, clothe" in the 14th century, and the sense of "display, marshal" emerged in the 16th century.
