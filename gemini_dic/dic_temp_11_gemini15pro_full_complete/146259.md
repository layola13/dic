ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + exuberant.  "Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much". "Exuberant" comes from Latin "exuberant-" (present participle of "exuberare"), meaning "to be abundant, overflow", from "ex-" ("out") + "uber-" ("fertile, abundant").  Therefore, "overexuberant" literally means "overly overflowing" with enthusiasm or emotion.
