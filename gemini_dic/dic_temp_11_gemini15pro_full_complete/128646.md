词源:  Originating from British slang, likely from the 19th century.  The precise etymology is uncertain, but some theories suggest a connection to the German word *nicken*, meaning "to nod" or "to make a quick movement," possibly referencing the swift action of a thief. Another theory connects it to the practice of cutting a notch or "nick" in something as a mark of ownership or theft.
