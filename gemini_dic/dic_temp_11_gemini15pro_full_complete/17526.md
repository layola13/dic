词源：This idiom originates from the world of hip-hop music, where "rap" refers to a rhythmic style of speaking or chanting.  "Beat" in this context means to defeat or overcome.  Therefore, "beat the rap" initially meant to overcome an accusation or criticism, and later evolved to mean avoiding legal punishment.
