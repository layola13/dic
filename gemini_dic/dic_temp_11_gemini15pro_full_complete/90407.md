PHRASE->

(Due to the archaic nature of "howsoever," it doesn't have common modern phrases.  It's generally replaced by "however" in modern usage.  Therefore, providing phrases with "however" is more practical.)

However difficult it is... = 无论多么困难...
However long it takes... = 无论需要多长时间...
However much it costs... = 无论花费多少...
However you look at it... = 无论你怎么看...
However that may be... = 无论如何...
