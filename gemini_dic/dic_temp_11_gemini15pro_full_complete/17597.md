beautifulest:/ˈbjuːtɪfʊlɪst/ | adj. | 最美丽的 | This form is considered non-standard English. While grammatically understandable, it is not commonly used and is generally considered incorrect.  The superlative form of "beautiful" is "most beautiful". | *She claimed to have the beautifulest garden in the neighborhood (non-standard). 她声称拥有附近最美的花园（不规范用法）。*

*He tried to paint the beautifulest sunset he had ever seen (non-standard). 他试图画出他所见过的最美的日落（不规范用法）。| 近义词: most beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, exquisite | 反义词: ugliest, hideous, unattractive | 词性: 形容词 (Adjective)

词源: From Middle English *beautevous*, from Anglo-Norman *beauteus*, ultimately from Late Latin *bellitās*, from Latin *bellus* ("beautiful, handsome, fine").  The "-est" ending is a standard superlative suffix, but its addition to "beautiful" creates a non-standard form.
