nonrecessive:/ˌnɒnriˈsesɪv/ /ˌnɑːnriˈsesɪv/ | adj. |非隐性的| Not recessive; dominant or codominant.  A nonrecessive gene will express itself even if paired with a recessive gene.| Example: The gene for brown eyes is nonrecessive.  棕色眼睛的基因是非隐性的。| Example:  Because the trait is nonrecessive, it is more likely to appear in the offspring. 因为这个性状是非隐性的，它更有可能出现在后代身上。| 近义词: dominant, expressive | 反义词: recessive | 词性: adjective
