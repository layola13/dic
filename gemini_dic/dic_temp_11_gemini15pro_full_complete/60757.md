electroglow:/ɪˌlɛktroʊɡloʊ/
n.
电辉光
A faint, optical emission from the upper atmospheres of planets, produced by the interaction of atmospheric gases with electrons from the magnetosphere.
Electromagnetic glows were observed on the dark side of Jupiter. 在木星的背面观察到了电磁辉光。
近义词: airglow,  aurora
反义词: (无明确的反义词)
词性: 名词

词源:
