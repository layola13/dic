ETYMOLOGY->
From art + -ful + -ly.  "Art" in this context originally meant "skill" or "craft," deriving from the Old French art and ultimately from the Latin artem, meaning "skill, art, craft."  The suffix "-ful" indicates "full of" or "characterized by," and "-ly" transforms the adjective "artful" into the adverb "artfully."
