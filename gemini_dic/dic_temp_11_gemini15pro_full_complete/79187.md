ETYMOLOGY->
From "glamour," a variant of "grammar" influenced by "gramarye" (magic, enchantment). Originally, "glamour" referred to a magic spell, often visual, that made something appear different from what it actually was.  This sense evolved into the modern meaning of an attractive or exciting quality.  "Glamourizing" is the verb form, meaning the act of making something glamorous.
