PHRASE->

(Since "awreak" is an adjective, it doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way nouns or verbs do.  It's more common to see it used in descriptive clauses.)


注意事项: "Awreak" is an archaic word and not commonly used in modern English.  Using a more modern synonym like "avenged" or "revenged" would be more natural in most contexts.
