ETYMOLOGY->
From the French term *se camper*, meaning "to pose in an exaggerated fashion."  The English word "camp" initially appeared in the early 20th century with a meaning related to homosexual behavior or style, often characterized by flamboyance and theatricality. The meaning broadened over time to encompass any deliberately exaggerated or theatrical behavior or style.
