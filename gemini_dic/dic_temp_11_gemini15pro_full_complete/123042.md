monera:/məˈnɪərə/| n. |原核生物界；无核生物界|A kingdom that contains unicellular organisms without a nucleus, such as bacteria.  It is no longer considered a valid taxonomic group. |例句：Monera was once considered a kingdom that included all prokaryotes. 原核生物界曾被认为是一个包含所有原核生物的界。

例句：The classification of Monera is now obsolete, having been replaced by Bacteria and Archaea.  原核生物界的分类现在已经过时，被细菌域和古菌域所取代。|近义词：prokaryote (though not a perfect synonym as this refers to the organisms themselves, not the kingdom), bacteria, archaea|反义词：eukarya (真核生物域)|词性:noun
