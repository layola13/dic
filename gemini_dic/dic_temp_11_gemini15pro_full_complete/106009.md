ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *cnafa* "boy, youth, servant," later "male servant, rogue," from Proto-Germanic *knabon* "boy," related to Old High German *knabo* "boy," German *Knabe* "boy," Gothic *knaba* "boy."  The original meaning was simply "boy, youth," but it gradually deteriorated in meaning to "servant," and then to "rogue, villain." The card-playing meaning of "jack" arose in the 17th century, perhaps from the knave's association with low characters or trickery.
