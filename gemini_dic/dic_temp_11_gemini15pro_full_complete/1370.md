词源：From Latin *accuratia, from accuratus (“prepared with care”), past participle of accurare (“to take care of”), from ad- + cura (“care”).

注意事项:
accuracy 本身就是名词，'s 是所有格形式，表示“准确性的……”。通常情况下，我们不会直接使用 accuracy's，而是使用 "the accuracy of something" 的形式。例如，我们会说 "the accuracy of the measurements" (测量的准确性)，而不是 "the measurements' accuracy's"。虽然语法上后者并非完全错误，但前者更自然流畅。
