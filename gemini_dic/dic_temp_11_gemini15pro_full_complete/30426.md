Etymology:
From central + -istic.  "Central" comes from the Late Latin "centralis," meaning "pertaining to a center,"  from "centrum" (center), which ultimately derives from the Greek "kéntron" (sharp point, center of a circle).  The suffix "-istic" forms adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characteristic of."
