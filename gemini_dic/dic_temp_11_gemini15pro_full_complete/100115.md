Etymology:
From Late Middle English *interpreten*, from Old French *interpreter*, from Latin *interpretārī* (“to explain, expound, interpret, translate”), from *interpres* (“broker, negotiator, translator, interpreter”), possibly from *inter* ("between") and *prēs* ("surety, guarantor").  The noun form "interpretation" also derives from the Latin verb *interpretārī*.
