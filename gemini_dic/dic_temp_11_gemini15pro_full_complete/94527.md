ETYMOLOGY->
From the late Middle English verb *imposen*, meaning "to lay on, inflict,"  from Old French *imposer*, from Latin *imponere* "to put upon, lay upon," from *in-* "on" + *ponere* "to put, place."  The adjectival form developed later, emphasizing the effect of something being "imposed" upon the viewer or experiencer.
