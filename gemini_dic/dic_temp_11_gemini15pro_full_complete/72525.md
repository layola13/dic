PHRASE->
(Since "flushest" is a superlative adjective, it doesn't typically form standard phrases.  It describes a state, not an action or relationship.)


词源:  From flush + -est (superlative suffix). Flush itself comes from Old French *fluxir (to flow), from Latin fluxus (flowing).  The sense of redness in the face comes from the idea of blood flowing to the surface.
