词源: From *dough + *nut, originally referring to small nuts of dough fried in fat.  The "dough" part is clear, related to "dough" meaning a thick mixture used for baking. The "nut" part likely refers to their small, round shape, resembling a nut.  The "hole" in the center came later, possibly to ensure even cooking.
