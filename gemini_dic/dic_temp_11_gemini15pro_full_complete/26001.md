ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *burthen*, from Old English *byrþen* (“burden, load, duty, charge”), from Proto-Germanic *burþinō (“that which is borne”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰer- (“to carry, bear”). Cognate with Old Frisian *byrthin* (“burden”), Old Saxon *burthina* (“burden”), Old High German *burdi* (“burden”), Old Norse *byrði* (“burden, birth”), Gothic *𐌱𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌳𐌴𐌹𐌽𐍃* (*baurdeins*, “burden”). Related to birth.  The spelling with <u> was prevalent until the 18th century, when the influence of the related word burden (from Old French *burden*, *bourdon*) led to the adoption of the <u> spelling.
