注意事项:

"Assumpsit" is an archaic legal term and is rarely used in modern English.  More common synonyms like "promise," "undertake," or "agree" are preferred in most contexts.  Its usage is primarily confined to legal history or very formal settings.  It's also important to note that the verb forms of "assumpsit" are less common than the noun form.
