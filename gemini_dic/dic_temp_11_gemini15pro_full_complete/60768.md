ETYMOLOGY->

From electro- (combining form meaning "electric") + -lytic (suffix forming adjectives).  The "electro-" part comes from Greek *ēlektron* meaning "amber," which was known for its static electrical properties. "-lytic" ultimately derives from Greek *lutikos* meaning "able to dissolve or loosen," relating to the chemical changes brought about by electrolysis.
