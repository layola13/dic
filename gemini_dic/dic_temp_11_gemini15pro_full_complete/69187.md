词源:  From Italian fazzoletto, diminutive of fazzo, from Latin facia (“bandage, strip of cloth”).

注意事项:  The word "fazzolet" is less common than "fazzoletto" (its Italian form), and "handkerchief" is the most common English equivalent.  While "fazzolet" does appear in some dictionaries, it's considered archaic or literary.  "Fazzoletto" is more commonly used, particularly in contexts related to Italian culture or fashion.
