PHRASE->
(Since "giling" is not a common English word, it's difficult to provide natural-sounding English phrases.  These examples use "grind" which is the closest equivalent.)
grind down:  The constant pressure began to grind him down.  持续的压力开始让他感到沮丧。
grind out: The factory grinds out thousands of units each day.  这家工厂每天生产数千台设备。

注意事项:

The word "giling" is not standard English. It appears to be borrowed from Indonesian or Malay, where it means "to grind, mill, or roll."  This analysis is based on that presumed meaning.  Native English speakers would use "grind," "mill," or "crush."
