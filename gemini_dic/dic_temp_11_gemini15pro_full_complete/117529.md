Etymology:
From Middle English *mēten*, from Old English *mētan* (to meet, find, fall in with, encounter, obtain), from Proto-Germanic *mōtijaną* (to meet), from Proto-Indo-European *h₁med-/*h₁mod- (to measure, assemble, fit together). Cognate with Old Frisian *mēta* (to meet, find, measure), Old Saxon *mōtian* (to meet), Old High German *mezan* (to measure), Old Norse *mæta* (to meet, measure), Gothic *motan* (to be allowed to, have to).  The archaic "meeten" form reflects an older conjugation pattern.
