cavillation:/ˌkævɪˈteɪʃən/| n.|空化，空蚀，气蚀|The formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid.  It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and create a shock wave.|The pump suffered damage due to cavitation.  (由于气蚀作用，泵受到了损坏。)|Synonyms:  erosion, pitting, corrosion|Antonyms:  solidification, compression|noun
