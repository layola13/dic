Etymology:
From Middle English *bouk*, from Old Norse *búkr* (“belly, trunk of the body”), from Proto-Germanic *būkiz* (“belly, trunk”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰewg- (“to swell, bend”). Cognate with Scots *bouk* (“body, trunk, carcass”), West Frisian *boek* (“belly, trunk”), Dutch *buik* (“belly, abdomen”), German *Bauch* (“belly, abdomen”), Swedish *buk* (“belly, abdomen”), Icelandic *búkur* (“belly, trunk of the body, book”).  The sense of "vomit" is probably related to the visceral feeling of nausea in the stomach.
