ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *frēoġan "to free, make free, love," from Proto-Germanic *frijaz (source also of Old Frisian fria "to free," Old Saxon frihan, Old High German vrien, German freien "to woo," Old Norse frjá "to love," Gothic frijon "to love"), from PIE root *pri- "to love, to like, to be fond of." The original sense of "beloved, friend" broadened to "free," perhaps via the notion of "one's own" (as opposed to a slave).
