ETYMOLOGY->
From "cocoon" (n.) + "-ing" (suffix forming present participles and gerunds). "Cocoon" comes from the French word "cocon," which in turn comes from the Provençal word "coucoun," meaning "shell" or "cocoon." Ultimately, the word is believed to be of imitative origin, echoing the sound of rustling leaves or silk.
