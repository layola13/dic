注意事项:  'idea's' is not standard English. While sometimes seen informally, the correct possessive form of "idea" is "idea's".  The plural of "idea" is "ideas," and the possessive of that plural is "ideas'."  For clarity, rephrasing is often the best solution (e.g., "the origin of the idea" instead of "the idea's origin").
