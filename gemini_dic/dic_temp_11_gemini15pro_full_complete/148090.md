Etymology:
From over- + scrupulous.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively," and "scrupulous" comes from the Latin "scrupulus," meaning "a small sharp stone," hence "anxiety, uneasiness, doubt."  The idea is that a scrupulous person is bothered by even small ethical concerns, like a small stone in their shoe.
