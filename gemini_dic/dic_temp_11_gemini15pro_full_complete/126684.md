ETYMOLOGY->
From the name "Ambrose Philips," a writer whose poems were ridiculed by Henry Carey in a satirical ballad called "Namby Pamby," published in 1726. The name, mimicking the rhythm of Philips's verse, became synonymous with weak, sentimental writing and later extended to describe a person with such characteristics.
