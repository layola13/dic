ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *ateint*, past participle of *ateindre* "to reach, attain, affect, convict," from Latin *attingere* "to touch upon, reach, attain," from *ad* "to" + *tangere* "to touch."  The legal sense of "to convict of treason or felony" arose from the consequences of such a conviction, which included forfeiture of property and corruption of blood.
