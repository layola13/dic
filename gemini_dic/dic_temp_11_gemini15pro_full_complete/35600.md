词源: From Middle English *cors*, from Old French *cors*, from Latin *cursus* ("course, running"), past participle of *currere* ("to run"). The original sense referred to something roughly or hastily made.  The meaning shifted over time to encompass roughness in texture and, later, in manners or speech.
