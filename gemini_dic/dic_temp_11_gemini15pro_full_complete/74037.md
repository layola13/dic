foryelde:  This word does not exist in standard English. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  However, if you meant "foreyield,"  I can offer a hypothetical analysis based on its potential component parts:

fore-/fɔːr/ | prefix | 前，预先 |  Indicates something happening before or in front. | Example: forewarn (预先警告) | Synonym: pre- | Antonym: post- | prefix

yield /jiːld/ | n. v. | 产量；屈服；产生；让步 |  As a noun: the amount produced. As a verb: to produce or provide; to surrender or submit. | Example: The apple tree yielded a bountiful harvest. (这棵苹果树收获丰盛。)  The driver yielded to the oncoming traffic. (司机避让迎面而来的车辆。) | Synonym: produce, surrender, submit | Antonym: resist, withhold, defy | noun, verb

foreyield (hypothetical) /fɔːrjiːld/ | v. | 预先让步，提前放弃 |  To surrender or give way in advance. | Example: He foreyielded his position in the negotiation. (他在谈判中预先放弃了自己的立场。) | Synonym: preemptively concede, surrender beforehand | Antonym: hold firm, stand ground | verb
