Etymology:
From anti- + style.  "Anti-" is a Greek prefix meaning "against," "opposite of," or "opposed to." "Style" comes from Old French "stile" and ultimately from Latin "stilus," originally meaning a pointed instrument for writing, and later developing the meaning of a manner of expression in writing or other arts.
