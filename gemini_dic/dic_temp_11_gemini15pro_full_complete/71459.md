ETYMOLOGY->
The precise origin of the word "flamenco" is uncertain.  Several theories exist, including:

* Association with Flanders:  In the 16th century,  many Flemish immigrants arrived in Spain, and some believe the flamboyant style of flamenco may have been associated with them.

* Connection with flamingos: The vibrant colors and passionate movements of flamenco are reminiscent of the bird, leading to this possible connection.

* Gypsy influence:  Flamenco has strong roots in Romani (Gypsy) culture, and the word might have originated from a Romani word.

* "Flamenco" as slang for "showy" or "ostentatious":  This meaning of the word existed before its association with the music and dance form.
