PHRASE->
Not commonly used in phrases. This word is more often used in formal or literary contexts.  Therefore, providing common phrases is difficult.  It's more helpful to understand its usage in sentences.

词源:  From en- + race.  "En-" is a prefix meaning "to put into or onto," related to the word "in."  Therefore, "enrace" literally means to "put into a race."  While this literal meaning is rarely used, the meaning of "incorporating into a group" or "imbuing with racial characteristics" is derived from this root.
