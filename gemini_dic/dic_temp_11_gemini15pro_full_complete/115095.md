manganeses: /ˈmæŋɡəˌniːzɪz/ | n. | 锰（的复数，不常用） | A hard, brittle, grayish-white metallic element, found in many minerals and used in alloys, especially with steel. Manganese is essential for plant and animal growth.  The plural form "manganeses" is rarely used; "manganese" is typically used for both singular and plural. |  The chemist analyzed the different manganeses in the ore sample (less common usage). 锰的复数形式“manganeses”很少使用；“manganese”通常用于单数和复数。|  近义词: (As an element, it has no true synonyms, but in its role in steel alloys it might be partially replaced by other elements like nickel or chromium.) | 反义词: None | 词性: noun
