compressure: /kəmˈprɛʃər/ | n. | 压缩,压强,压力 | The act of compressing or the state of being compressed; pressure. | The compressure of the gas within the cylinder increased as the piston moved. 气缸内气体的压缩压力随着活塞的运动而增加。 | 近义词: compression, pressure, squeezing | 反义词: decompression, expansion | 词性: 名词

Etymology:  From com- (together, with) + pressure.  Ultimately from Latin *compressura, from compressus, past participle of comprimere (to compress).
