"Way" comes from Old English weg "way, road, path; journey, expedition; direction, course," from Proto-Germanic *wegwaz (source also of Old Saxon weg, Old Frisian wei, Old Norse vegr, Middle Dutch wech, Dutch weg, Old High German weg, German Weg, Gothic wigs "way"), from PIE root *wegh- "to move, transport in a vehicle."
