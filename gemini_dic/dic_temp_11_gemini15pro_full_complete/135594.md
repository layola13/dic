ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + portentous + -ly.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Portentous" comes from the Latin "portentosus," meaning "full of portents," where a "portent" is a sign or warning of something, often something momentous or calamitous, about to happen.  "-ly" is a suffix used to form adverbs.
