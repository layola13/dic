karyokinesis:/ˌkæri.oʊ.kɪˈniːsɪs/ /ˌkæri.əʊ.kɪˈniːsɪs/
noun
核分裂
The process of nuclear division, involving the division of the chromosomes and their distribution to daughter nuclei, usually followed by cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm).
Karyokinesis is the first step in cell division. 核分裂是细胞分裂的第一步。
During karyokinesis, the chromosomes are duplicated and separated. 在核分裂过程中，染色体被复制和分离。
Synonym: mitosis, nuclear division
Antonym: cytokinesis (although often paired, they are distinct processes)
