近义词: computational, algorithmic
反义词: non-computational


ETYMOLOGY->
From "depute" (meaning to appoint as a substitute or agent) + "-ational" (forming adjectives relating to actions or processes).  The word "depute" comes from the Latin "deputare" (to assign, to allot).  However, the formation "deputational" seems to be a relatively recent coinage, likely analogical to "computational" and possibly influenced by the increasing importance of computation in various fields. It's not a standard or widely recognized term. It might be a mishearing or misspelling of "computational," or it could be a neologism used in a specific context.
