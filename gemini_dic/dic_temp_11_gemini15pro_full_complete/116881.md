The word "mayard" doesn't appear in standard English dictionaries. It's possible it's a misspelling, a proper noun (like a surname), a regional dialect word, or a neologism.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, its intended meaning), I can offer a more helpful response.


Since I can't analyze "mayard," I'll demonstrate the requested format using the word "axiom":

axiom:/ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；自公理 |A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.|  Mathematics is based on certain axioms. 数学是建立在某些公理之上的。| synonym:  postulate, principle, theorem | antonym: absurdity, paradox | noun
