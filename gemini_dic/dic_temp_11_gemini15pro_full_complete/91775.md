Etymology:
From hyper- + enthusiasm.  "Hyper-" is a prefix meaning "over, above, excessive," from Greek *huper*. "Enthusiasm" comes from Greek *enthousiasmos*, meaning "inspiration, divine possession," from *enthousiazein* "to be inspired," from *en* "in" + *theos* "god."  Therefore, the word literally implies an excessive, almost godlike, level of excitement.
