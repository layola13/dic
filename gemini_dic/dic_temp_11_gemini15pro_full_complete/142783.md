oughne is not a valid English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a non-existent word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a legitimate analysis.  Perhaps you meant "ought"?

If you meant "ought", here is the analysis:

ought:/ɔːt/ |modal verb| 应该，应当| Used to indicate duty or correctness, or to express probability or expectation.| You ought to apologize. 你应该道歉。|synonyms: should, must, have to| antonyms: shouldn't, mustn't| verb
