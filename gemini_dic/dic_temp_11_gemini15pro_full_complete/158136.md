##platelet /ˈpleɪtlət/n.)platelet is a small, irregular-shaped colorless body of the blood that assists in blood coagulation. Platelets are fragments of large cells called megakaryocytes,found in the bone marrow.  They lack a nucleus and are crucial for hemostasis, a process that stops bleeding by forming blood clots.  When ablood vessel is damaged, platelets adhere to the exposed collagen fibers, becoming activated and releasing substances that promote further platelet aggregation and the formation of a fibrin clot.  Platelet disorders can lead to excessive bleeding or abnormal clotting.  The normal plateletcount in the blood is between 150,000 and 450,000 per microliter.  Low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) can result from various conditions, including certain medications,autoimmune diseases, and bone marrow disorders.  Conversely, high platelet counts (thrombocytosis) can also indicate underlying health problems.过多，开了个验血单以检查血小板计数。platelet)the early microscopic observations of these blood components.
