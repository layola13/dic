imaginary number:/ɪˈmædʒɪˌnɛri ˈnʌmbər/ | n. |虚数|A number that when squared gives a negative result.  It is expressed in the form *bi*, where *b* is a real number and *i* is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1. |Example: 3i is an imaginary number because (3i)² = -9.  3i是一个虚数，因为(3i)² = -9。|Synonym: complex number (when combined with a real number)|Antonym: real number|noun
