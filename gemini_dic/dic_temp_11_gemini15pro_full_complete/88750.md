词源: From the verb "to hock," meaning to pawn or pledge something as security for a loan.  This likely originated from the Dutch word "hok," meaning "hutch" or "cage," referring to a place where pawned goods were kept.  Over time, the term "hocker" came to refer to someone who deals in pawned goods, and later expanded to include other types of vendors, especially those selling cheaply.  The sense of "someone who takes bets" likely arose from the association with handling money and transactions.
