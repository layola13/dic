fumaru:/fuːmɑːruː/ | v. | 冒烟；熏制 | to emit smoke; to smoke (something) | The chimney is fumaruing heavily. 烟囱正在冒着浓烟。 |  The chef is fumaruing the salmon. 厨师正在熏制鲑鱼。| synonyms: smoke, smolder | antonyms: extinguish, clear | verb


ETYMOLOGY->
Likely a Japanese word ( fumaru - 踏まる), but it's not standard Japanese and doesn't mean "to smoke" or "to fume".  It may be a dialectical variation or a neologism.  If intending to use a Japanese word for "to smoke,"  "kemuru (煙る)" would be a closer approximation for smoldering or emitting smoke and "suu (吸う)" for inhaling smoke (like smoking a cigarette).
