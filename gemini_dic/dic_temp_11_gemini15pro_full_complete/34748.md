clientest:/ˈklaɪəntɪst/ | adj. | 最像客户的; 最以客户为中心的 |  A superlative form of "client-focused" or "client-oriented," suggesting the highest degree of prioritizing client needs.  However, it's not a standard English word and is rarely used.  A more common and accepted way to express this would be "most client-focused" or "most client-centric." | This company boasts the *clientest* service in the industry (though this usage is non-standard).  这家公司自诩拥有业内最以客户为中心的的服务（尽管这种用法不规范）。 | 近义词: most client-focused, most client-centric | 反义词: inconsiderate, negligent | 词性: 形容词


clientest:/ˈklaɪəntɪst/ | n. | (非标准用法) 对客户最关注的人; 最以客户为中心的人 | A hypothetical noun form of "clientest" referring to a person who is extremely client-focused. Again, this is not a standard English word and should be avoided in formal writing. Use "the most client-focused person" or similar phrases instead. | He is the *clientest* person I know (non-standard usage). 他是我认识的最关注客户的人（非标准用法）。| 近义词: the most client-focused person, the most client-centric individual | 反义词: uncaring individual, negligent person | 词性: 名词 (非标准用法)


词源:

Derived from "client" + "-est" (superlative suffix). While "-est" is a common superlative suffix (e.g., biggest, fastest), it's not typically used with words like "client" which are already conceptually focused.

用法说明:

"Clientest" is not a standard English word and its use is generally discouraged.  While grammatically understandable, it sounds awkward and unnatural.  Instead, use "most client-focused," "most client-centric," or "the most client-focused person" for clearer and more accepted communication.
