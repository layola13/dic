Etymology:
cloth (n.) + like (suffix)

cloth (n.): Old English *clað, from Proto-Germanic *klaþaz (source also of Old Norse klaði "cloth, garment," Old Frisian kleth, Middle Dutch cleet, Dutch kleed "cloth, garment," Old High German kleit "garment," German Kleid "dress, garment"), from PIE root *(s)klei- "to stick, adhere."

like (suffix): Old English -lic, from Proto-Germanic *-likan (source also of Old Frisian -lik, Old Saxon -lik, Old Norse -ligr, Dutch -lijk, Old High German -lih, German -lich), from PIE root *leig- "to bind," also "to lie, lay."  The suffix originally meant "having the form or nature of," thus "suitable for, resembling."
