commutability:/kəˌmjuːtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可交换性；可替代性 |The property of elements in a set that allows their order to be changed without affecting the outcome of an operation.  This is often seen in mathematics, especially with operations like addition and multiplication. | The commutability of addition means that 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. | synonyms: interchangeability, exchangeability | antonyms: non-commutability, incommunicability | noun

commute:/kəˈmjuːt/ | v. | 交换；通勤；减刑 | To travel regularly between work and home.  Also, in mathematics, to interchange two operations. | I commute to work by train every day.  | synonyms: travel, journey, transit | antonyms: stay, reside | verb

commutative:/kəˈmjuːtətɪv/ | adj. | 可交换的 | Relating to the property of commutability. |  Addition is a commutative operation. | synonyms: interchangeable, exchangeable | antonyms: non-commutative | adjective
