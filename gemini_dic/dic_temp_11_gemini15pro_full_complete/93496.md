ETYMOLOGY->
Australian slang, first recorded in the 1920s.  Its origin is uncertain, but it is possibly a blend of "illy" (meaning "illegal" or "illicit") and "whacker" (meaning "something large or impressive").  Another theory suggests it derives from "williewagtail," a type of Australian bird known for its playful and mischievous behavior.
