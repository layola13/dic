ETYMOLOGY->
"investment" comes from Late Middle English: from Old French, or from invest- ‘clothe’ (from Latin investire) + -ment. Originally meant ‘besieging’, later extended to the notion of putting money to use.
"banker" comes from Middle French banquier, from Italian banca ‘bench, moneychanger’s table’.  The word originally referred to money-changers who worked at tables or benches, evolving to mean those who manage money.
