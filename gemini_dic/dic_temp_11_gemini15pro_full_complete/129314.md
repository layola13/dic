PHRASE->
(Since "nohs" is a childish/humorous term, set phrases are less common.  Here are some playful examples using the word):

Booger nohs =  (A nose with a booger in it)
Runny nohs = (A nose that is running with mucus)
Big nohs = (A large nose)
Stuffy nohs = (A congested nose)
Cute little nohs = (A small, cute nose)


注意事项:

词源： "nohs" is a non-standard spelling of "nose," likely originating from childish mispronunciation or playful alteration of the word. It does not have a formal etymology like the standard word "nose," which derives from Old English "nosu."
