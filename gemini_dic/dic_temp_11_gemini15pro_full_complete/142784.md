注意事项:

Ought is a modal verb and always takes a bare infinitive (without "to").  Although "ought to" is common, "ought" can be used alone, especially in questions and negatives.  For example, "Ought I go?" or "He oughtn't complain."  While "had ought to" is sometimes heard in informal speech, it is considered grammatically incorrect and should be avoided.
