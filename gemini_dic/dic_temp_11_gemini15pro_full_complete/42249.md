ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *contenance "bearing, behavior, appearance," from contenir "to contain," from Latin continere "to hold together, enclose," from com- "together" + tenere "to hold." The sense shifted from "bearing" to "facial expression" in the 16th century.  The verb sense "to support" developed from the idea of giving one's approval or "bearing" to something.
