注意事项:  "Dobs" is informal and primarily used in certain dialects, particularly Australian and British English.  It is not commonly used in American English.  While it can be used as a noun (a lie), it can also function as a verb (to inform on someone).  Context is crucial for understanding the intended meaning.
