词源:  "Non-" (Latin prefix meaning "not") + "absent" (from Latin "absens", meaning "away, absent") + "-ation" (suffix forming nouns of action or process).  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being absent".


注意事项:  This word is not commonly used.  "Attendance," "presence," or simply "not being absent" are more common and natural ways to express this concept.
