ok's:/oʊˈkeɪz/ | n. | 许可，同意 | Approval, acceptance; something that is satisfactory or acceptable. | The boss gave his ok's for the project to proceed. 老板同意该项目继续进行。 | 近义词: approvals, consents, permissions | 反义词: disapprovals, rejections, denials | 词性: 名词 (plural noun)

词源:  Shortened form of "OK" (all correct), which likely originated from a humorous misspelling of "all correct" as "oll korrect" in the 1830s.  The plural form "ok's" is formed by adding an apostrophe and an "s."
