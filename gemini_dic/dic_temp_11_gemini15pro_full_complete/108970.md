词源:  "Leet's" is a contraction of "let us," with "let" originating from Old English *lǣtan and "us" from Old English ūs.


注意事项:

"Leet's" is informal and primarily used in spoken language or casual written communication, especially online. It's less common in formal writing.

While grammatically it represents "let us," it often functions pragmatically as a first-person plural imperative (e.g., "Let's go!" meaning "We should go!").


It's difficult to construct grammatically correct examples of "let's" in perfect, continuous, or past tenses because it typically implies a future action or immediate suggestion.  The examples provided under continuous tenses are technically imperatives.  "Let's" is almost always followed by the base form of a verb.
