词源：
From Spanish *corral* "yard, pen for livestock," from Old Spanish *currale,* perhaps originally meaning "a circle of carriages or wagons" used as a makeshift enclosure, from *curro* "meeting, market," from Latin *concursus* "a running together, confluence," from *concurrere* "to run together," from *com-* "together" (see *com-*) + *currere* "to run" (from PIE root *kers-* "to run").
