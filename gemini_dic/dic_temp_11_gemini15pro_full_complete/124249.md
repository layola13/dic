PHRASE->
Not typically used in phrases.  "Most-longhaired" is a descriptive adjective and less likely to be part of set phrases compared to single-word adjectives.


Etymology:  "most" (superlative adverb) + "long" (adjective) + "haired" (adjective suffix).  "Long" traces back to Old English "lang," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*langaz." "Hair" comes from Old English "hær," also with Germanic roots.
