词源:  The origin of "doddle" is uncertain, but it's thought to have emerged in the late 19th century.  One theory suggests it might be related to "dawdle," meaning to waste time or move slowly.  Another proposes a connection to the verb "to dodder," meaning to tremble or totter, perhaps implying something done effortlessly and without much thought.
