cotransductions:/ˌkoʊtrænsˈdʌkʃənz/ | n. | 共转导 | The simultaneous transfer of multiple genetic markers from a donor bacterium to a recipient bacterium by transduction. This often occurs when multiple genes are located close together on the bacterial chromosome or plasmid.  | Cotransductions of antibiotic resistance genes are a growing concern in clinical settings.  临床环境中，抗生素抗性基因的共转导是一个日益严重的问题。| Near synonyms: joint transduction, linked transduction | Antonyms:  N/A (Antonyms are not applicable to this scientific term.) | noun
