词源: From Middle English *fomilen, frequentative of *fōn (“to seize, grasp, take”), from Old English *fōn, *fōhange (“to seize”), from Proto-Germanic *fōną (“to seize, catch”).  Cognate with Scots famel (“to grope”), West Frisian fammelje (“to fumble”), Dutch fommelen (“to fumble”), German fummeln (“to fumble”).  Related also to Old English fōn (“to catch, take hold of”).  The meaning shifted from "grope, grab awkwardly" to "drop something" in the late 16th century.
