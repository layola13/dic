ETYMOLOGY->
From the obsolete *boggard* meaning a hobgoblin or scarecrow, likely related to "bugbear".  The golf term derives from the "bogey man" – the imaginary opponent whose score a golfer tries to beat.  The railway term's origin is uncertain, possibly influenced by the verb "bogie" meaning to move erratically.
