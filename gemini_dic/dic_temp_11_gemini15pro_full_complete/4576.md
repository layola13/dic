ETYMOLOGY->
From alcohol + -ically.  "Alcohol" comes from Medieval Latin "alcohol," from Arabic "al-kuḥl," meaning "kohl" (a fine powder used as eye makeup). The sense of "alcohol" as a refined substance was extended to "spirits of wine" in the 16th century, and later generalized to other substances.  "-ically" is a suffix forming adverbs from adjectives ending in "-ic."
