词源: From Old French *desconfit*, past participle of *desconfire* "to defeat, rout," from *des-* "expressing reversal" + *confire* "to make, prepare, preserve," from Latin *conficere* "to accomplish, complete."  The original meaning of defeat in battle evolved to a more general sense of frustrating or thwarting someone's plans, and later to the current meaning of causing emotional discomfort.
