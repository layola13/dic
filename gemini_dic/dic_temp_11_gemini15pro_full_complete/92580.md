注意事项:

's is a contraction and can't be used in all tenses correctly.  The examples above demonstrating incorrect usage highlight this. You cannot use 's (as a contraction for is, has, or us) in the past perfect continuous, future tenses, or in certain instances in the past tenses without creating grammatically incorrect sentences.  It must be replaced with the full form of the verb.
