ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *moralliche*, from Old French *moralment*, from Latin *mōrāliter*, from *mōrālis* (“moral”) + *-iter*, adverbial suffix.  The English word thus represents a borrowing of a French formation based on a Latin word ultimately derived from *mōs* (“custom, manner, conduct, behavior”).
