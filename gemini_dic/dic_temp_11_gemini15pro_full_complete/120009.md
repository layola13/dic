PHRASE-> (Millimicron is a technical term and doesn't have common phrase usage.  It's more likely to be found within specific scientific contexts.)  However, here are some phrases demonstrating usage within a sentence:

A wavelength of 400 millimicrons corresponds to violet light.
The particle size was measured to be several millimicrons.
The diameter of the fiber was less than a millimicron.
The thickness of the coating was expressed in millimicrons.
The instrument could measure distances down to a few millimicrons.
