词源：

The etymology of "chud" as a derogatory term for urban conservatives is uncertain.  It may be linked to the 1984 horror film "C.H.U.D." (Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers), although the connection is unclear.  The term gained popularity in the 2010s, particularly online, and is now widely recognized as a pejorative.  It's important to note that the use of this term can be considered offensive and inflammatory.
