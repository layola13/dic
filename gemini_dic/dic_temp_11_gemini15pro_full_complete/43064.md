注意事项:

"Cowori" itself is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a slang or informal term, possibly borrowed or adapted from another language (perhaps Korean or Indonesian, where similar-sounding words relate to cowardice).  Therefore, providing a traditional etymology is difficult.  The provided information is based on the likely intended meaning and usage.
