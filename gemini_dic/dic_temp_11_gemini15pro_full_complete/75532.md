fuan:/ˈfʊæn/ | adj. | 不安的，焦虑的 |  "Fuan" isn't a standard English word. It likely represents a misspelling or mishearing of "fuanxious," which is not a dictionary-defined word but might be used informally to combine "fu" (possibly meant as a prefix implying negativity, perhaps borrowed from Mandarin Chinese where it can mean "not" or "negative") and "anxious." It conveys a feeling of unease or worry. | There's no standard English example sentence for "fuan."  A constructed example could be: "He felt fuan about the upcoming exam." 他对即将到来的考试感到不安。| 近义词: anxious, uneasy, apprehensive, worried | 反义词: calm, relaxed, tranquil | 词性: Adjective (non-standard)
