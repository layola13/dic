ETYMOLOGY->
From Old North French chatel, from Late Latin capitale, "principal sum of money, capital," from Latin caput, "head." Originally referred to property, especially livestock, which was the principal form of wealth. The meaning later expanded to include all movable property and eventually, tragically, to slaves.
