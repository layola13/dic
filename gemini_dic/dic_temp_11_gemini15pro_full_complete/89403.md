homostyled:/ˌhəʊməˈstaɪld/ | adj. | 同型花柱的 | Having styles of the same length as the stamens, promoting self-pollination.  A flower is homostyled when the style is about the same length as the stamens. |  Example: Many primrose species exhibit homostyled flowers. 许多报春花种类都展现出同型花柱的花朵。

Example: Homostyled flowers often have a higher rate of self-fertilization. 同型花柱的花朵通常具有更高的自花授粉率。| 近义词: self-pollinating (self-fertilizing is a consequence, not a synonym for the flower structure) | 反义词: heterostyled | 词性: adjective
