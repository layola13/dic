注意事项:

"Loo's" with an apostrophe-s is grammatically incorrect, although sometimes used informally.  The correct form is simply "loo". This entire explanation assumes the intended word was "loo."  If "loo's" specifically with the possessive is meant, it would imply something belonging to the loo, which is unusual, e.g., "The loo's light is broken." (The light in the bathroom is broken.)
