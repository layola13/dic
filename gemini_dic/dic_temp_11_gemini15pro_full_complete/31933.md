From Old French *eschec*, *eschac* ("check" in chess, a check, defeat), from Medieval Latin *scaccus*, from Arabic *shah*  ("king" in chess), from Persian *šāh* ("king, ruler").  The financial sense developed from the use of checkered cloth on counting-boards, and the verb sense of "stopping or restraining" comes from the chess meaning.
