Etymology:
From Middle English *coupen, from Old French couper (“to hit, strike, cut”), from Vulgar Latin *colpāre, from Latin colaphus (“a blow with the fist”), from Ancient Greek κόλαφος (kólaphos, “a blow, cuff”).  The semantic shift happened from "to exchange blows" to "to contend with" and finally "to deal with successfully".
