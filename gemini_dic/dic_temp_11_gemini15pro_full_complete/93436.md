lumnet:  This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It likely is a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It might be a combination of "lumen" and "net,"  but without more context, its meaning is unclear.  If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer some further speculation.
