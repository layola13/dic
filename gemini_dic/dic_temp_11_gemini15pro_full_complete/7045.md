anelectrotonus:/ˌænɪlɛkˈtrɒtənəs/ | n. |阳极电紧张|A change in the electrical potential of a nerve or muscle in the region near the anode (positive electrode) during the passage of an electric current.  It results in a decreased excitability of the nerve or muscle. | Example: Anelectrotonus can be observed in nerve fibers when a depolarizing current is applied.  阳极电紧张可以在神经纤维施加去极化电流时观察到。

Example: The experiment demonstrated the effects of anelectrotonus on muscle contraction.  实验演示了阳极电紧张对肌肉收缩的影响。|Near synonyms:  catelectrotonus | Antonyms: catelectrotonus | noun
