deterministic:/dɪˌtɜːrmɪˈnɪstɪk/| adj.|确定性的，决定性的|Relating to determinism; determined or caused by previous events or natural laws.|例句：The universe is not deterministic; there is an element of chance. 宇宙并非确定性的；存在偶然因素。|例句：A deterministic system is one in which the future state is completely determined by the present state. 确定性系统是指未来状态完全由现在状态决定的系统。|近义词：predictable, foreseeable, preordained|反义词：random, stochastic, indeterministic|词性:adjective

Etymology->
From determine + -istic.  Determine traces back through Old French to Latin *determinare "to limit, fix," from de- "completely" + terminare "to bound, limit," from terminus "boundary, limit." The suffix -istic is used to form adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."
