interresistance:/ˌɪntərɪˈzɪstəns/ | n. |相互电阻，互阻 |The interresistance between the two wires needs to be measured. 两根导线之间的互阻需要测量。| Example: The interresistance between components can affect the circuit's performance. 元件之间的互阻会影响电路的性能。  The engineer calculated the interresistance of the connected devices. 工程师计算了连接设备的互阻。 | Synonym: mutual resistance | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "conductivity" in a broad sense) | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From "inter-" (between) + "resistance" (the act of resisting). "Resistance" ultimately derives from Latin "resistere" (to resist).
