inaquation:/ɪnɪˈkweɪʃən/
noun
不等式
An inequation is a statement that shows the relationship between two expressions that are not equal.
例句：The inequation x + 2 > 5 represents all values of x greater than 3.  不等式 x + 2 > 5 表示 x 的所有大于 3 的值。

例句：Solving the inequation 2y < 10 gives us y < 5.  解不等式 2y < 10，得到 y < 5。
近义词：inequality
反义词：equation
词性:n.
