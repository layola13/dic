hashing:/ˈhæʃɪŋ/| n.|哈希，散列|The process of converting an input of any length into a fixed-size string of characters using a mathematical algorithm.  This output is called a hash value or hash code.  It's commonly used in computer science for data storage, retrieval, and cryptography.|Data hashing is used to protect passwords.|近义词：hashing algorithm, hash function|反义词: N/A|名词
