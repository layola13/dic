indimensional:/ɪndɪˈmɛnʃənl/ | adj. | 无维度的，不可测量的 |  Having or relating to no dimensions; immeasurable.  It describes something that cannot be measured or quantified, often in a metaphorical or abstract sense.  It can also suggest something vast, limitless, or beyond comprehension. | Her grief was indimensional, a vast ocean of sorrow. 她悲痛无边无际，如同一片广阔的悲伤之海。| The universe's potential is indimensional, beyond our current understanding. 宇宙的潜能是无限的，超越了我们目前的理解。| 近义词：immeasurable, boundless, infinite | 反义词：finite, limited, measurable | 词性：形容词

词源:  "in-" (not) + "dimensional" (relating to dimensions).  The prefix "in-" negates the concept of dimensions, resulting in the meaning of "without dimensions."
