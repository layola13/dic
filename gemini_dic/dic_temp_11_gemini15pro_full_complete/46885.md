PHRASE->
While the use of "daringness's" with possessive is grammatically correct, it's extremely uncommon and often sounds awkward.  It's better to rephrase using "the daringness of" instead. Therefore, phrases are difficult to provide and would not be natural.  Focus on using "the daringness of" constructions for clearer and more natural English.
