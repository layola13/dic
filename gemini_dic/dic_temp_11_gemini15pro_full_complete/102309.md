"ivier" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It is possible that it's a misspelling, a proper noun (name), a regional dialect word, or a neologism.  

If you could provide more context, like a sentence where you encountered the word, or if you perhaps meant a different word, I might be able to help.

For demonstration purposes, I will analyze the word "ivy" instead, as it is somewhat similar and a common English word:

ivy: /ˈaɪvi/ | n. | 常春藤 | A climbing evergreen plant with glossy, dark green leaves. | The ivy climbed up the old stone wall. 常春藤爬上了古老的石墙. |  The house was covered in ivy.  房子被常春藤覆盖着。 | 近义词: vine, creeper | 反义词:  (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun
