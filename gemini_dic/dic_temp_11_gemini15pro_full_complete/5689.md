aluminas:/əˈluːmɪnəz/
|n.|氧化铝|A white crystalline oxide of aluminum, occurring naturally as corundum and existing in several forms, including a-alumina, y-alumina, and activated alumina, used in the manufacture of abrasives, refractories, ceramics, and catalysts.|Activated aluminas are used as adsorbents.|近义词: aluminum oxide|反义词: None|词性: Noun

Etymology:
From alumina, from French alumine, from alum (see alum). The plural form aluminas arose from the various crystalline forms of alumina (α-alumina, γ-alumina, etc.).
