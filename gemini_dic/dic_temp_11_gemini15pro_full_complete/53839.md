ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *disconsolat*, from Late Latin *disconsolatus*, from Latin *dis-* (expressing negation) + *consolatus* (past participle of *consolari* ‘to comfort’), from *con-* (with, together) + *solari* (to comfort, soothe).  The suffix *-ness* transforms the adjective *disconsolate* into the noun *disconsolateness*, indicating a state or quality of being disconsolate.
