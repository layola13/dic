mesomyodous:/ˌmiːzoʊˈmaɪədəs/| adj.|中肌型的，连接中肌的|Having the mesomyarian type of muscle arrangement, where the muscle blocks along the body wall are attached to the central skeletal axis.  It's a specific term used in zoology, particularly in describing the musculature of nematodes (roundworms).|Example:  The nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* exhibits a mesomyodous body wall musculature.|近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it's a very specific term.  Perhaps "myarian" in a broader context.)|反义词:  (No direct antonym, potentially "platymyarian" or "coelomyarian" depending on the contrasting muscle arrangement being discussed.)|词性: Adjective
