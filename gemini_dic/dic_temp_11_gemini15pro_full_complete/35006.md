clonality:/kloʊˈnælɪti/
n.
克隆性，无性繁殖性
The state of being clonal; the property of being derived asexually from a single ancestor.
Bacterial infections often exhibit high clonality, meaning they originate from a single bacterium.  细菌感染通常表现出高克隆性，意味着它们起源于单个细菌。
The clonality of the tumor cells was confirmed by genetic analysis. 通过基因分析证实了肿瘤细胞的克隆性。
近义词: uniformity, homogeneity
反义词: diversity, heterogeneity
词性: noun

Etymology:
From clone + -ality.  Clone from Greek klon "twig, slip, cutting used for propagation".
