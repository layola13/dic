词源:  From *be- + scum + -er.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "thoroughly" or "all over." "Scum" refers to a layer of dirt or filth.  "-er" is a suffix used to form agent nouns, in this case, indicating something that performs the action of "scumming."  Therefore, "bescummer" literally means "to cover completely with scum."
