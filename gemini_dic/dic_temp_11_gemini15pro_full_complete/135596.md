注意事项:
This word is quite rare and often replaced by simpler synonyms like "ordinariness" or "unremarkableness."  It is formed by adding the prefixes "non-" and "-ous" and the suffix "-ness" to the root word "portent" (meaning a sign or omen). Due to its length and complexity, it is best used sparingly in formal writing or when a specific nuance is desired.
