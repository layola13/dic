electrostatical: /ɪˌlɛktroʊˈstætɪkəl/ | adj. | 静电的 | Relating to static electricity; produced or caused by static electricity. |  Electrostatical forces hold the toner to the paper in a laser printer. 激光打印机中静电力使墨粉附着在纸上。 | Electrostatic, static | N/A | adjective

electrostatic: /ɪˌlɛktroʊˈstætɪk/ | adj. | 静电的 | Relating to static electricity; produced or caused by static electricity. |  Electrostatic charges can build up on synthetic fabrics. 静电荷会在合成纤维上积聚。 | Electrostatical, static | N/A | adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From electro- + static. "Electro-" ultimately derives from the Greek word "elektron" meaning "amber," as the ancient Greeks observed static electricity by rubbing amber.  "Static" comes from the Greek word "statikos," meaning "causing to stand," referring to the stationary nature of static electricity.
