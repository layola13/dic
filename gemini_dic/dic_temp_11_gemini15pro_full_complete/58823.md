ETYMOLOGY->
From dupe (v.) + -able.  Dupe comes from the Old French word "de", meaning "of" or "from," and "huppe," a hoopoe bird, known for its distinctive crest.  The bird's crest was sometimes compared to a fool's cap, leading to the association of the hoopoe with foolishness and being easily tricked.
