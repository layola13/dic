"menses's" is grammatically incorrect. The word "menses" is already a plural noun and does not take a possessive 's. The correct form to indicate possession related to menses would be "of the menses" or, more naturally, a rephrasing of the sentence to avoid this construction altogether.  Since "menses's" is not a valid word, I cannot provide a full analysis.  Instead, I will provide an analysis of "menses":

menses: /ˈmɛnsiːz/ | n. | 月经；经期 | The monthly discharge of blood from the uterus of non-pregnant women from puberty to menopause. |  The onset of menses usually occurs during adolescence.  青春期通常会出现月经初潮。 | synonyms: period, menstruation | antonyms: N/A | noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Her menses usually last about five days. = 她的月经通常持续五天左右。
The menses are a normal part of the female reproductive cycle. = 月经是女性生殖周期的正常组成部分。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
She is experiencing her menses right now. = 她现在正在来月经。
(This usage is uncommon; "having her period" is more natural)  她现在正在来月经。(这种用法不常见；“having her period”更自然)

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Her menses have already started. = 她的月经已经开始了。
She has experienced irregular menses for several months. = 她的月经已经几个月不规律了。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):

(It would be unusual to say something like "She has been experiencing her menses for five days." - instead, "Her menses have lasted for five days" is preferred.) (说“She has been experiencing her menses for five days”是不寻常的 - 相反，更倾向于说“Her menses have lasted for five days”。)

PHRASE-> (Phrases with "menses" are not common. It's more natural to use "period" in everyday conversation.)
onset of menses = 月经初潮
cessation of menses = 月经停止
duration of menses = 月经持续时间
menstrual cycle (related, but not a phrase *with* menses) = 月经周期
menstrual flow (related, but not a phrase *with* menses) = 月经量


注意事项:  As mentioned above, "menses" is a formal term. In common conversation, "period" is much more frequently used.
