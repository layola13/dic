PHRASE->
(While the word "attle" is largely obsolete, and therefore doesn't have common phrases in modern usage, here are some phrases using its synonyms, focused on the "waste" meaning):
Get rid of the attle (rubbish).  清除垃圾。
Clear up the attle (mess).  清理垃圾（脏乱）。
Dispose of the attle (waste).  处理废物。
Sort through the attle (junk).  整理垃圾（废旧物品）。
The attle (trash) is piling up.  垃圾堆积如山。

注意事项:
The word "attle" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  Its synonyms like "rubbish," "trash," "garbage," and "waste" are much more common.  The "quarrel" meaning is even more obsolete.
