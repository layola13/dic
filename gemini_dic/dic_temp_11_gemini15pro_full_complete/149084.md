##oxamide: 详细解析| n. | 草酰胺 |an organic compound with the formula C₂H₄N₂O₂. It's a white crystalline solid that is soluble in water.  It'sthe diamide of oxalic acid, meaning it's formed by replacing the hydroxyl groups of oxalic acid with amide groups (-CONH₂). Oxamidefinds uses as a fertilizer, a flame retardant, and a precursor to other organic compounds.  Its relatively high nitrogen content makes it particularly attractive as a slow-release nitrogen fertilizer. However, its low solubility can limit its effectiveness.Research into improving its solubility and application methods continues.  The compound is also of interest in various industrial applications due to its thermal properties and potential in polymer synthesis.agriculture and industry.  草酰胺是一种有用的化合物，在农业和工业中都有应用。the same chemical structure, but compounds with similar functionalities in fertilizer applications could be considered.
