PHRASE->

(This word is not commonly used in phrases.  It's more of a descriptive adjective.  Therefore, constructing natural phrases is difficult and forced.  It's better to focus on its usage as a standalone adjective.)


注意事项:

"Nonfeebler" is not a standard English word.  It is formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "feebler," but this construction is not common or natural.  While grammatically correct in its formation, it sounds awkward and is unlikely to be encountered in typical conversation or writing. Using synonyms like "strong," "robust," or "powerful" is recommended.
