词源:  "Made out" originates from the phrasal verb "to make out," which has multiple meanings.  The most relevant to the adjective/noun form is the sense of "to manage or fare," which evolved into "to succeed" or "to achieve a desired outcome."  The informal senses related to kissing and fabrication likely developed from this general sense of "achieving something."
