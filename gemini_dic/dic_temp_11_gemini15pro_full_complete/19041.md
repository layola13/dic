PHRASE-> (Beth as a word is rarely used in modern English outside of its original meaning as a letter, so phrases are limited to its historical usage as a wager.)

Historically, one might have said:

"I'll make a beth with you." = 我要和你打个赌。(古语，现已少用)


注意事项:
Beth is primarily used in its literal sense as the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Its usage as a word meaning "bet" or "wager" is archaic.
