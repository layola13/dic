nonblocking:/ˌnɒnˈblɒkɪŋ/ /ˌnɑːnˈblɑːkɪŋ/| adj.|非阻塞的|Not interrupting or delaying the execution of other processes or operations.  A nonblocking operation returns immediately, even if it hasn't completed yet.  It allows other operations to continue while the nonblocking operation progresses in the background.|The server uses nonblocking sockets to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.  服务器使用非阻塞套接字来同时处理多个客户端连接。|The `recv()` function was set to nonblocking mode, so it wouldn't halt the program. `recv()` 函数被设置为非阻塞模式，因此它不会暂停程序。|近义词：asynchronous, concurrent|反义词：blocking, synchronous|词性:adjective
