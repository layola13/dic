##pangaea: 详细解析ə/ | n. | 泛大陆 |Pangaea (/pænˈdʒiːə/), also spelled Pangea, was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoiceras.  It assembled from earlier continental units approximately 335 million years ago, and it began to break apart about 175 million years ago.  The name Pangaea comes from the Greek words "pan" (meaning "all" or "entire") and "Gaia" (meaning "Earth").  The existence of Pangaea is a cornerstone of the theory of platetectonics, explaining the distribution of fossils, geological formations, and similar rock types across different continents.  Evidence supporting the existence of Pangaea includes the matching of continental shapes, the distribution of fossils of the same species across widely separated continents, and similar rock formations and geological structures found across various landmasses. The breakup of Pangaea led to the formation of the continents and oceans we know today.  Scientists continue to study this supercontinent to better understand the Earth's dynamic geological processes.the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart.continent (超大陆)century combining Greek roots:entire Earth," reflecting its nature as a single, massive landmass encompassing most of the Earth's continents. The term was popularized by Alfred Wegener, a key figure in the development of the theory of continental drift, which eventually evolved into the modern theory of plate tectonics.word "Pangaea" is primarily used in geological and paleontological contexts.  It is always used as a proper noun, referring to the specific supercontinent that existed in the Earth's distant past.  You wouldn't use it in everyday conversation, but you might encounter it in scientific articles, textbooks,or documentaries about Earth's history and geology.  It's crucial to understand its connection to plate tectonics and the profound impact it had on the shaping of the modern world's geography and biodiversity.
