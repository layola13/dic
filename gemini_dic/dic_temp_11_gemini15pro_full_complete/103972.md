注意事项:

"Jugated" is not a very common word outside of specific scientific contexts. Its usage is primarily limited to chemistry and biology.  While "joined" or "connected" might be suitable synonyms in general conversation, they may not convey the specific scientific meaning intended by "jugated". Therefore, choosing the correct synonym depends heavily on the context.
