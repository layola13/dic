The word "atam" isn't a standard English word. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term in a specific field, or a word from another language.  Could you please double-check the spelling or provide more context?  If it's from another language, please specify the language.

Since I can't analyze "atam," I'll use "atom" as an example, following your requested format:

atom: /ˈætəm/ | n. |原子| The smallest unit of an element, having a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around it.|  Example: An atom is the basic building block of matter. 原子是物质的基本组成部分。| Example:  The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom. 氢原子是最简单的原子。 | Synonym: particle, element (in some contexts) | Antonym: molecule (in some contexts) | noun
