mesameboid:/ˌmɛsəˈmiːbɔɪd/
adjective
中胚层样的；间叶细胞样的
Resembling or characteristic of a mesameboid.  Relating to or denoting a type of cell in sponges that can differentiate into other cell types.
This organism exhibits mesameboid characteristics, able to differentiate into various cell types.  这个生物体表现出间叶细胞样的特性，能够分化成各种细胞类型。
The researchers observed the mesameboid behavior of the cells under the microscope. 研究人员在显微镜下观察了这些细胞的间叶细胞样行为。
近义词: mesenchymal, amoeboid
反义词: N/A
词性: adjective
词源:  "mes-" (from Greek mesos, "middle") + "amoeb-" (from Amoeba, a genus of single-celled organisms) + "-oid" (suffix meaning "resembling" or "like").  The term refers to cells resembling amoebas found in the mesohyl (middle layer) of sponges.
