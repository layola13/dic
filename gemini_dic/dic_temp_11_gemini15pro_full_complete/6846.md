ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin anathema, from Ecclesiastical Greek anáthema "a thing accursed, offering devoted to evil," literally "a thing set up, laid by," from anatithenai "set up, dedicate," from ana- "up" + tithenai "to put, place."  Originally referring to an offering set aside for destruction, it later came to mean a solemn curse or denunciation.
