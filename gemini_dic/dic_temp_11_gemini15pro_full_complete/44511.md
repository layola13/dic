Etymology: From 'cross' (adjective) + '-ness' (suffix forming nouns of state or quality).  The adjective 'cross' itself comes from Old Norse 'kross' meaning "cross, affliction," likely influenced by Old French 'cros' and Latin 'crux' "cross."  The sense of "angry, ill-tempered" developed from the association of suffering and affliction with a bad temper.
