PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using “laying-up” itself.  The phrases relate to the *reasons* for laying up, such as "laid up with the flu" or "laid up after surgery".  Since “laying-up” is a specific action, it’s not usually part of a set phrase.  It's more commonly used in full descriptive sentences.
