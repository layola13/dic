metallicities: /ˌmɛtəˈlɪsɪtiz/
| n. |金屬豐度；金屬含量|The abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in a star, galaxy, or other astronomical object.  It is usually expressed as the ratio of the abundance of iron to hydrogen compared to that of the Sun.|The metallicities of stars in globular clusters provide clues about their age and formation.|Synonym: metal abundances|Antonym: (No direct antonym, perhaps low metallicity)|Noun
