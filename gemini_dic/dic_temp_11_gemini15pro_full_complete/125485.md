multiprogram:/ˌmʌltiˈproʊɡræm/ | n. | 多道程序设计 |  The ability of a computer to execute more than one program at the same time by dividing the CPU's time among them. This differs from multiprocessing, which involves multiple processors. | The operating system uses multiprogram to increase efficiency by keeping the CPU busy while one program is waiting for input/output operations. | 近义词: multitasking, concurrent programming | 反义词: single-tasking, uniprogramming | 词性: 名词

Etymology:  multi- (prefix meaning "many") + program (noun). The prefix "multi-" comes from Latin "multus" meaning "much, many."  The word "program" ultimately derives from Greek "programma" meaning "a written public notice."
