intervisibilities:/ˌɪntərˌvɪzɪˈbɪlɪtiz/| n. |相互可见度，通视性|The intervisibilities between the observation points are crucial for accurate surveying.  观测点之间的相互可见度对于精确测量至关重要。|The analysis of intervisibilities is essential in planning wireless communication networks.  在规划无线通信网络时，通视性分析至关重要。|近义词：sightlines, lines of sight|反义词：invisibility, obscurity|词性:名词

Etymology:
From "intervisible" + "-ities".
"Intervisible" comes from "inter-" (between) + "visible" (able to be seen).  "Visible" derives from Latin "visibilis", from "vidēre" (to see).  "-ities" is a suffix used to form plural nouns denoting qualities or states.
