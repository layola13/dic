nonstyptical:/ˌnɒnˈstɪpɪkəl/ | adj. | 非典型的，不典型的 | Not representative of a type, group, or class.  Deviating from what is usual or expected. |  Her nonstyptical approach to problem-solving made her a valuable asset to the team. 她非典型的解决问题的方法使她成为团队的宝贵资产。

词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "styptical" (a likely misspelling or neologism based on "typical," from Late Latin "typicus," meaning "figurative, pertaining to a type," from Greek "typikos").  The word likely arose through a combination of misspelling and blending with other words like "nonspecific" or "atypical."  It's not a standard English word and should be avoided in formal writing.
