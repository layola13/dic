注意事项:  "Forthputting" is not as commonly used as some of its synonyms like "assertive," "outspoken," or "frank." While it's a valid word, using a more common synonym might be preferable in some contexts.  It also has a slightly more positive connotation than "outspoken," which can sometimes imply being rude or insensitive.  "Forthputting" suggests being direct and helpful.
