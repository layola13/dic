ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin contemplatus, past participle of contemplari ("to contemplate, observe, survey, gaze upon, view attentively, consider attentively"), from con- ("together") + templum ("temple, consecrated place"). Originally, contemplation meant observation of signs from the gods within a templum (hence also contemplation as religious meditation).
