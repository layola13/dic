decidabilities:/dɪˌsaɪdəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |可判定性（复数）|The quality or state of being decidable; the property of a problem or question for which an effective method exists to determine its solution or answer.  It often refers to the existence of an algorithm that can, in a finite number of steps, determine whether a given statement is true or false within a formal system.|The decidabilities of various mathematical problems are a central topic in computer science.|近义词：solvability, computability|反义词：undecidability|词性:名词
