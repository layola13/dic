词源:  's' is a contraction deriving from the Old English verb 'is',  itself from Proto-Germanic *isti.  The possessive 's' comes from Old English genitive singular ending -es.


注意事项:
While "what's" can contract "what does", it is less common than "what is" and "what has".  It's more usual to use "what does" in formal writing.  The possessive 's' can also be represented as 's after a plural noun ending in -s (e.g., the boys' toys).
