overcolorations: /ˌoʊvərˌkʌləˈreɪʃənz/
| n. | 过度着色，颜色过深 | The act of coloring something too much, resulting in excessively deep or unnatural colors. | The overcolorations in the photograph made it look artificial. 照片过度着色使它看起来很假。| 近义词：over-saturation, excessive coloring | 反义词：under-saturation, muted colors | 词性: noun


词源:  "over-" (prefix meaning "excessive") + "coloration" (noun from "color" + "-ation," a suffix forming nouns of action or process).  The word is formed by adding the prefix "over-" to "coloration," which itself derives from the Latin "color" (meaning "color") and the suffix "-ation."
