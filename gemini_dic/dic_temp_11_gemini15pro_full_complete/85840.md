hcfcs:/ˌeɪtʃ siː ɛf siːz/ | n. |氢氯氟烃|  Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are a group of man-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon. They are used as refrigerants, solvents, and blowing agents.  HCFCs are less damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs, but they are still potent greenhouse gases. | HCFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. 氢氯氟烃根据《蒙特利尔议定书》正在逐步淘汰。| synonyms: refrigerants, coolants | antonyms: ozone-friendly substances | noun
