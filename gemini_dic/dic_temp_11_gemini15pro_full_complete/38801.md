conductory:/kənˈdʌktəri/ | adj. | 传导的; 有传导性的 | Relating to conduction or acting as a conductor. |  Copper is a highly conductory material. 铜是一种高导电性材料。| The conductory properties of this metal are exceptional. 这种金属的导电性能非常出色。 | 近义词: conductive, transmitting | 反义词: insulating, nonconductive | 词性: 形容词

词源: From "conduct" + "-ory" (suffix forming adjectives meaning "relating to," "serving for," "of the nature of").  "Conduct" comes from the Latin "conductus," past participle of "conducere" ("to lead together," "to bring together"), from "com-" ("together") + "ducere" ("to lead").
