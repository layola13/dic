nanosecond's:/ˈnænəʊˌsɛkəndz/ | n. | 纳秒的 |  Possessive form of nanosecond, indicating ownership or belonging.  A nanosecond is one billionth of a second. | The nanosecond's delay was barely perceptible.  这纳秒的延迟几乎难以察觉。 | Near Synonyms: none (for the possessive form, synonyms would apply to the base word "nanosecond") | Antonyms: none (for the possessive form, antonyms would apply to the base word "nanosecond") |  noun (possessive)


Etymology:  "nano-" from Greek nanos (dwarf) + "second" (unit of time).
