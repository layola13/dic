noncausality:/ˌnɒnˌkɔːˈzælɪti/ | n. | 非因果性，非因果关系 | The lack of a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables or events.  It implies that one event does not influence or determine the occurrence of another. |  Example 1: Quantum entanglement exhibits noncausality, as the states of entangled particles are correlated regardless of the distance separating them. 量子纠缠展现了非因果性，因为纠缠粒子的状态是相关的，无论它们之间的距离有多远。

Example 2: Some philosophical arguments suggest noncausality in free will, where choices are not predetermined by prior events. 一些哲学论证表明自由意志中的非因果性，即选择不是由先前事件预先决定的。 | 近义词: acausality, non-determinism | 反义词: causality, determinism | 词性: noun
