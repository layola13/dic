Etymology:
"Bom" as a noun meaning "defective item" is of uncertain origin, possibly related to the word "boom," meaning a sudden increase, ironically referring to a sudden increase in defective products. "Bom" as a verb and as a noun meaning "bomb" comes from the same source as the word "bomb," ultimately from the Greek word "bombos," meaning "a deep, hollow sound."
