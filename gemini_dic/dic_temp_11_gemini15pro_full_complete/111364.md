Etymology:
From Middle English *liveree, from Anglo-Norman *livere, from Old French livree (“delivery, allowance of food or clothes, act of delivering”), from livrer (“to deliver”), from Latin līberāre (“to liberate, to free”).  The sense shifted from "allowance of food and clothes" to simply "clothes," and then specifically to the distinctive clothing given to servants or members of a guild or company.
