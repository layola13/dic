ETYMOLOGY->
From French *gallique* "Gaulish," from Latin *Gallicus* "of Gaul," from *Gallus* "a Gaul" (inhabitant of ancient Gaul).  The sense of "bold, defiant" likely arose from the stereotypical image of Gauls as fierce warriors resisting Roman rule.  The sense of "sarcastic, impertinent" may be a later development, perhaps influenced by the French reputation for wit and irony.
