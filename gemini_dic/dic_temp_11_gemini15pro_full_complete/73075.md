词源：The term "footsie" or "footsies" likely originates from the playful nature of the act, referencing the use of "feet" and the diminutive suffix "-sie" to create a lighthearted and somewhat childish term. The extended meaning of colluding likely comes from the secretive and under-the-table nature of the game.
