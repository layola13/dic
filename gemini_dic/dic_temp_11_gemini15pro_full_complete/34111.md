注意事项:

"cl" as a stand-alone element isn't a full word and doesn't have the same range of grammatical functions as words like "hello."  It functions as a prefix, and its meaning is derived from the words it shortens.  Therefore, providing traditional grammatical categories like noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc., and their related usages (tenses, aspects, voices, moods) isn't applicable in the same way.  The provided examples illustrate how "cl-" derived words function within different grammatical contexts.
