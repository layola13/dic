chalazogamy:/ˌkæləˈzɒɡəmi/ | n. |合点受精| Fertilization in which the pollen tube enters the ovule by a route other than through the micropyle (the usual opening for pollen tubes in most flowering plants), such as through the chalaza (the basal part of the ovule).| Casuarina is a classic example of a plant exhibiting chalazogamy.| 近义词: basigamy | 反义词: porogamy | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Greek *khalaza* ("hailstone," hence the ovule's chalaza) + *-gamos* ("marriage," referring to fertilization).
