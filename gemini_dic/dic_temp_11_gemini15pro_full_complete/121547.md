ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") + measure.  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly," "badly," "astray," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*missa-" "wrongly," related to Old Norse "mis-," Old High German "miss-."  "Measure" comes from Old French "mesure" and ultimately from Latin "mensura" "a measuring, measure."
