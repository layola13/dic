|v.|过度衰减；过度削弱|Reduces the strength or intensity of something, especially a signal or sound, to an excessive degree.|The audio engineer overattenuated the high frequencies, making the music sound dull.|overdamp, oversquelch|underemphasize, boost|verb


ETYMOLOGY->
"over-" (prefix meaning "excessively, too much") + "attenuate" (from Latin "attenuare," meaning "to make thin, weaken").
