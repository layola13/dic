词源:
From the verb "dissert" (to discuss formally and systematically), which comes from the Latin "dissertare" (to discuss, debate), frequentative of "disserere" (to scatter seeds, plant, discuss), from "dis-" (apart) + "serere" (to join, link, sow).  The "-ly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb.
