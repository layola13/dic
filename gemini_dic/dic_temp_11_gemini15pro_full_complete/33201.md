chromospheric:/ˌkroʊməˈsfɪrɪk/ | adj. | 色球的，色球层的 | Relating to the chromosphere, the reddish layer of the Sun's atmosphere just above the photosphere. |  The chromospheric network is a complex structure visible in certain wavelengths of light. 色球网络是一种在特定波长的光下可见的复杂结构。

The chromospheric temperature rises dramatically as you move further away from the Sun's surface.  当你远离太阳表面时，色球层的温度会急剧上升。 | 近义词: solar (in a broader sense) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From "chromo-" (color) + "sphere" (globe, ball) + "-ic" (adjectival suffix). "Chromo-" ultimately comes from Greek "chrōma" (color). "Sphere" comes from Greek "sphaira" (ball, globe).
