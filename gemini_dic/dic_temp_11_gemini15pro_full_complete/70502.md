词源:
From Middle English *filchen*, probably frequentative of *filen* (“to defile, pollute”), from Old English *fȳlan* (“to make foul, dirty, pollute, defile”), from Proto-Germanic *fūlijaną* (“to make foul”), from Proto-Indo-European *pū- (“to rot, stink”).  Cognate with Dutch *vuilen* (“to dirty, soil”), German *fühlen* (“to feel”). More at foul.  The semantic shift is from "to defile by theft" to "to steal."
