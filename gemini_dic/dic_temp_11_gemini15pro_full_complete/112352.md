|近义词：alluring, enticing, captivating, charming, attractive|反义词：repulsive, unappealing, unattractive|词性:形容词


词源:

Likely derived from the Middle English word "luren," meaning "to allure" or "to tempt," which in turn comes from the Old French "loerre" and ultimately from the Germanic root "*leur-," meaning "to deceive" or "to betray."  This suggests an original sense of attracting someone through charm or deception.  Over time, the negative connotations faded, leaving behind the more general sense of "appealing."
