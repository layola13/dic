詞源:  From Latin *mosumus, from mos (custom, manner, habit) + -umus (suffix).  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mē- (to measure).  The sense development likely went from "customary" to "occurring at a regular time," then to "seasonal." This word is rarely used in modern English and might be considered archaic or technical.  More common synonyms like "seasonal" are preferred.
