This term is often used in legal and philosophical contexts.|The contract contains a defeasible clause that allows either party to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances.  该合同包含一个可废止条款，允许任何一方在特定情况下终止协议。

The argument was defeasible because it relied on a faulty premise.  这个论点是可以辩驳的，因为它依赖于一个错误的前提。|近义词：revocable, annullable, voidable, overturnable, challengeable|反义词：indefeasible, absolute, incontestable, unchallengeable|词性: adjective

词源:  From Late Middle English *defeisible*, from Old French *defeisible*, from Latin *dēfēsibilis* "that can be annulled", from *dēfendere* "to ward off, defend, protect" (from *dē* "away" + *fendere* "to strike") + *-ibilis* forming adjectives.  The sense shift occurred because something that can be "warded off" can also be "annulled" or "overturned".
