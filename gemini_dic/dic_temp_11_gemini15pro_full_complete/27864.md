词源：
The origin of "canoodle" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the mid-19th century.  One theory suggests it might be related to the word "noodle," perhaps playfully referencing the intertwined nature of embracing couples. Another theory connects it to the German word "knudeln," meaning "to cuddle."  Regardless of its precise roots, the word quickly gained popularity as a playful and informal term for affectionate intimacy.
