endostyle:/ˈɛndoʊstaɪl/| n.|内柱|A ciliated groove in the pharynx of lower chordates (such as tunicates and lancelets) that secretes mucus to trap food particles.  It is considered homologous to the thyroid gland in vertebrates.|The endostyle of the lancelet filters food particles from the water.|近义词:hypobranchial groove|反义词: (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical feature)|noun
