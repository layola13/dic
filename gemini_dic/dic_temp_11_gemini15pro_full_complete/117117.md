ETYMOLOGY->
From "mealy" (soft, bland) + "mouthed" (having a specified kind of mouth).  "Mealy" comes from Old English "melo" (meal, flour).  The sense of being soft or bland developed from the texture of meal.  "Mouthed" is a simple combination of "mouth" and the suffix "-ed." The combined term "mealy-mouthed" figuratively describes someone whose speech is as bland and insubstantial as meal.
