ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *miserlinesse*, from Old French *miserablete* (“wretchedness, poverty”), from Latin *miserābilis* (“pitiable, wretched”), from *miser* (“wretched, unfortunate”).  The sense shifted from "wretchedness" to "stinginess" likely due to the association of poverty with hoarding resources.
