PHRASE-> (Due to the awkwardness and infrequent usage of "diseasednesses," common phrases are not applicable.  It's best to avoid using this word altogether.)


注意事项:  As mentioned repeatedly, "diseasednesses" is not a commonly used word.  While grammatically sound, it sounds artificial and cumbersome.  It is strongly recommended to use alternatives like "diseases," "illnesses," "sicknesses," or "morbidities" instead.
