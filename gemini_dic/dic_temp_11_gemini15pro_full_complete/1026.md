Etymology:
From "accelerate" + "-able". "Accelerate" comes from Late Latin "acceleratus", past participle of "accelerare"  "to hasten," from Latin "ad-" (to) + "celerare" (to quicken, hasten), from "celer" (swift). "-able" is a suffix meaning "capable of being," from Old French "-able" and directly from Latin "-abilis".
