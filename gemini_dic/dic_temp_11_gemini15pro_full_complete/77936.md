The word "genoes" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a technical term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (like the sentence it's used in, or the field of study it relates to), I can try to provide more information.

However, assuming you meant **"genes"**, here's the breakdown:

genes: /dʒiːnz/ | n. |基因|The basic physical and functional unit of heredity made up of DNA. |例句：Genes determine many of our characteristics. 基因决定了我们的许多特征。|例句：Scientists are studying the role of genes in disease. 科学家们正在研究基因在疾病中的作用。 |近义词：DNA, genome, genotype |反义词: N/A |noun
