The word "banau" does not exist in standard English.  It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a dialectal variation.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it's from or the sentence where you encountered it, I can offer a more accurate analysis.

However, assuming you might be thinking of a similar-sounding English word, I'll provide an analysis for "**ban**" and "**banal**," as these are somewhat close phonetically and might be what you're looking for.
