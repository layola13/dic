Etymology:
From Old English *hlot (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *hlautaz (“share, portion, what is allotted”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱleyd- (“to incline, lean, bend”). Cognate with Old Saxon hlōt (“lot, choice”), Old Frisian hlot, Dutch lot (“lot, prize, fate”), Old High German hlōz (German Los (“lot, fate, ticket”)), Old Norse hlutr (“share, portion, thing”), Gothic 𐌷𐌻𐌰𐌿𐍄𐍃 (hlauts, “lot, share”).  The meaning “piece of land” is from the practice of assigning portions of land by lot.
