词源:
From *chippy* (adjective) + *-ness* (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality).  *Chippy* itself likely originated from *chip* (noun), referring to a small piece of wood, and by extension, something insignificant.  The sense of "irritable" likely developed from the notion of being easily broken or splintered, like a chip of wood.
