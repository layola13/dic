词源: "intensive" comes from the Late Latin "intensivus", meaning "stretched, strained, increased."  "Care" comes from the Old English "caru,"  meaning "anxiety, sorrow, grief," which later evolved to mean "attention, heed, charge."

用法说明: "Intensive care" usually refers to a specialized ward in a hospital (ICU) or the type of treatment provided there. It's almost always used as a singular noun (intensive care) or as a compound adjective (intensive-care).  While "intensive-cares" is grammatically possible as a plural noun (e.g., referring to different types of intensive care), it's very rarely used.  The adjective form is hyphenated.
