as nutty as a fruitcake (containing nuts, like acorns) =  疯疯癫癫的 (Meaning: Crazy or eccentric)
  This idiom uses "nutty" which relates to nuts, although not directly to acorns.
a hard nut to crack =  难以对付的人或事 (Meaning: A difficult problem or person to deal with)  While this idiom doesn't use acorn, it uses the concept of a nut being hard, similar to an acorn.
