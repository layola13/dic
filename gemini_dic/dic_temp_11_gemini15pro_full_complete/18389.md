词源：  "be-" (prefix meaning "to make" or "to cause to be") + "lock" (verb meaning "to fasten with a lock").  The prefix "be-" adds intensity or completeness to the verb "lock."


注意事项:  "Belock" is not as common as the simple verb "lock."  It is often used in more formal or literary contexts to emphasize the act of securing something.
