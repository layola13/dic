denitrification:/ˌdiːˌnaɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |反硝化作用|The biological process by which nitrates (NO3-) are reduced to nitrogen gas (N2) by anaerobic bacteria, thus removing bioavailable nitrogen from the ecosystem.|例句：Denitrification is an important process in the nitrogen cycle that helps to regulate the amount of nitrogen in the environment. 反硝化作用是氮循环中的一个重要过程，有助于调节环境中的氮含量。

例句：Excessive denitrification can lead to the release of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. 过度的反硝化作用会导致一氧化二氮的释放，这是一种强效的温室气体。|近义词：nitrate reduction|反义词：nitrification|词性：名词
