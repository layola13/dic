Etymology:
From over- + mystification.  "Over-" acts as a prefix indicating excess or going beyond a certain limit. "Mystification" comes from the verb "mystify," which in turn derives from the word "mystery" (from Old French "misterie," ultimately from Latin "ministerium" - service, office, function).  The suffix "-fication" creates a noun meaning the act or process of doing something.
