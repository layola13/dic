alquifou:/ˈælkɪfuː/
n.
a type of lead sulfide; antimony sulfide; potter's ore.
A metallic gray mineral composed of lead sulfide (PbS), used as an ore of lead and sometimes silver. Also called galena. Alquifou can also refer to antimony sulfide or potter's ore.
The alchemist used alquifou in his experiments. 炼金术士在他的实验中使用了硫化铅。

近义词: galena, lead sulfide, stibnite (for antimony sulfide)
反义词: None (as it's a specific mineral, it doesn't have a direct opposite)
词性: Noun


Etymology:
From Medieval Latin alquifoux, alqifol, from Arabic al-kuḥl "kohl, powdered antimony sulfide," from al "the" + kuḥl.  Originally referred to powdered antimony sulfide used as eye makeup.  The meaning shifted to encompass lead sulfide (galena) due to its similar appearance.
