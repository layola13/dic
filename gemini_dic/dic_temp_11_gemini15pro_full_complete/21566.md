词源: "Bluesiest" comes from "blues," which originated in African American communities in the southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's believed to be derived from "blue devils," meaning melancholy or depression. The "-y" suffix turns it into an adjective ("bluesy"), and "-est" creates the superlative form ("bluesiest").
