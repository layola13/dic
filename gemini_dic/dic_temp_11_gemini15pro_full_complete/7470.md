词源:  Likely a variant or misspelling of "annite", a black mica mineral known for its shiny, layered structure.  The term "annite" comes from the Latin "annus" (year), referring to the layered structure resembling annual growth rings.  "Anite" might have arisen as a simplified or misheard version of "annite."
