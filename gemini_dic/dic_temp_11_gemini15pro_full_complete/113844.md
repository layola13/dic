PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  Since it's a relatively technical term, it's more likely to be used in scientific or technical contexts.)


注意事项:  The word "madefication" is not a common English word.  It seems to be a relatively recent coinage, possibly derived from "made," implying the act of making something wet.  While grammatically correct based on its construction, it might be better to use more common synonyms like "humidification," "moistening," or "wetting" in most contexts.
