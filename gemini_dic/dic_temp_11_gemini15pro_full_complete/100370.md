PHRASE->
process of interstratification 互层作用的过程
evidence of interstratification 互层作用的证据
study of interstratification 互层作用的研究

Etymology: From inter- + stratification.  "Inter-" signifies "between" or "among," while "stratification" refers to the formation of layers.  Therefore, "interstratification" literally means the layering between or among other layers.
