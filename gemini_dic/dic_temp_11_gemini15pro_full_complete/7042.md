词源： From Latin *analis, from anus “ring, circle.” The original meaning referred to the anal sphincter muscle, which is ring-shaped.  The meaning broadened over time to refer to the absence of pain or discomfort, especially in the anal region, and eventually to a general sense of ease and comfort.


注意事项： While "anele" is a valid word derived from Latin, it is not commonly used in modern English.  "Anal" is more frequently used, but primarily in a medical or anatomical context.  For general descriptions of comfort and ease, synonyms like "comfortable," "relaxed," "peaceful," etc. are preferred.
