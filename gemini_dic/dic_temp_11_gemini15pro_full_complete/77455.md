ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *gai "joyful, merry," from Frankish *gahi, from Proto-Germanic *gahiz "sudden, quick, active," from PIE root *gheu- "to pour, libate." The meaning shifted from "merry" to "bright, showy" (mid-14c.), then to "dissolute" (1630s), and finally to "homosexual" (1930s, originally underworld slang).
