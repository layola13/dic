词源：From Latin *desultorius* "leaping down," from *desilire* "to leap down," from *de-* "down" + *salire* "to leap."  The original sense referred to a rider in a Roman circus who leaped from one horse to another, giving an impression of disconnectedness.  This sense of disconnectedness evolved into the modern meaning of "lacking a plan or purpose."
