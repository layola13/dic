coss:/kɒs/| n.| 代数余弦 (algebraic cosine)| An archaic term for algebraic cosine, a function in mathematics that relates the angles of a right triangle to the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. | Example:  The coss of 30 degrees is √3/2.  30度的余弦是√3/2。|Synonym: cosine|Antonym: (No direct antonym for a mathematical function)|n.

PHRASE-> (This word is rarely used in phrases in modern English.  Here are some examples of how "cosine" might be used, since they are synonymous)

find the cosine = 求余弦值
cosine of an angle = 一个角的余弦
cosine function = 余弦函数
inverse cosine = 反余弦
cosine rule = 余弦定理

注意事项:  "Coss" is an archaic term.  In modern mathematics and everyday usage, the term "cosine" is universally preferred.
