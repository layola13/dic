ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *balken, from Old Norse *balka (“to pile up, heap”), from Proto-Germanic *balkoną (“beam, ridge”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰelǵʰ- (“to swell, bulge”). Related to bulge.  The original sense was of a ridge of plowed land or a strip of unplowed land between furrows, hence an obstacle or impediment. The sense of "hesitate, refuse to proceed" developed later.
