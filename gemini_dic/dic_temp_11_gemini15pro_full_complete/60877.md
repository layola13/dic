注意事项:

词源： "elely" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a  neologism or a rare archaic form, possibly derived from "elevate" and meant to function as an adverbial form of "elysian" (relating to paradise).  It is not found in standard dictionaries.

"elely" 不是标准英语词汇。它似乎是一个新造词或罕见的古体形式，可能源自 “elevate”，意在用作 “elysian”（与天堂有关）的副词形式。在标准词典中找不到它。
