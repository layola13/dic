ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *cancre, from Latin cancer (“crab, cancer”), from Proto-Italic *kanḱrós, from Proto-Indo-European *ḱónkʰros (“ulcer, swelling”), from *ḱenk- (“to swell, curve”).  The sense development from "crab" to "cancer" occurred because spreading tumors were thought to resemble a crab.  Further semantic development to "canker" arose from the resemblance of plant diseases to cancerous growths.
