ETYMOLOGY->
From concerned + -ness.  "Concerned" comes from the past participle of the verb "concern," which traces back to the Old French "concerner" and ultimately the Latin "concernere" meaning "to mix together, to pertain to." The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
