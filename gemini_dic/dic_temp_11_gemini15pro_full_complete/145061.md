Etymology:
From over- + ambitious + -ness + -es (plural suffix).  "Over-" indicates "too much" or "excessive". "Ambitious" comes from the French "ambitieux" and ultimately the Latin "ambitio," meaning "a going around, a canvassing for office." "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or degree. "-es" marks the plural form.
