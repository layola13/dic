Etymology:  From Late Middle English *enformen*, from Old French *enformer* (to instruct, train, teach), from Latin *informare* (to shape, form, train, instruct, educate). The prefix *in-* means "in" or "into," and *formare* means "to form" or "to shape."  Thus, informing originally meant "to give form to" or "to mold."
