keitloa is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  However, if you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I may be able to offer more assistance.

If you meant "what" instead of "keitloa", here's the analysis:

what /wɒt; hwɒt/ (wət; hwət)
| pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. |
What is your name? 你叫什么名字？

What did you eat for lunch? 你午饭吃了什么？


|interjection| 什么(表示惊讶) | Expressing surprise or disbelief. | What! You won the lottery? 什么！你中了彩票？

What!  He's leaving already? 什么! 他已经要走了?


|近义词: which | 反义词: N/A | pronoun |
