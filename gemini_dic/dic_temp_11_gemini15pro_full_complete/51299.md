ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *detaillier "cut into pieces, divide," from de- "down, away" + taillier "to cut" (from Latin talea "a cutting, rod, stick").  The original sense was of cutting something into smaller pieces, thus revealing its intricacies.  The modern sense of "small item or fact" developed from this.
