The term often describes minerals found together in a specific geological setting, suggesting a common origin or formation process.  It's important to distinguish paragenesis (the sequence of mineral formation) from paragenic, which describes the simultaneous or associated formation.ic association of quartz and pyrite in this vein suggests a hydrothermal origin.  这个矿脉中石英和黄铁矿的共生组合表明其为热液成因。relationships between different sulfide minerals in the ore body.  该研究重点关注矿体中不同硫化物矿物之间的成矿关系。:**to the origin beside or alongside something else," reflecting the co-occurrence of minerals during formation.The term often appears in scientific papers, geological reports, and textbooks related to these fields.  It’s less common in everyday conversation.solution.  Paragenic (adj.) describes the minerals that form together during this process, highlighting their simultaneous or closely associated formation.  Understanding paragenesis helps scientists determine the geochronological history and processes responsible for the formation of the rock or ore body in question. This temporal aspect is distinct from the purelyassociative meaning of paragenic.
