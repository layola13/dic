词源:  "Favest" is a recent slang creation derived from "favorite" by adding the "-est" superlative suffix, mimicking the formation of words like "biggest" or "smallest." While "-est" is typically added to monosyllabic or disyllabic adjectives, its use with "favorite" is considered informal and non-standard.
