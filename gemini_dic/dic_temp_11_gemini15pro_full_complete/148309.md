##oversolidification:  详细解析ɑːlɪdɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 过度固化；过度凝固 |desired or optimal level.  This can occur in various contexts, including:such as shrinkage porosity, hot tearing, and reduced mechanical properties. It typically happens when the cooling rate is too slow, allowing for excessive grain growth and the formation of large, coarse grains which are weaker.  The resulting structure is less denseand less resistant to stress.the production of ice cream, where slow freezing can lead to large ice crystals.  Similarly, in the making of jellies or jams, over-gelation due to excessive use of gelling agents may render the final product overly firm.as excessive strength gain leading to cracking, reduced workability during placement, and potential issues with durability due to internal stresses. This is highly dependent on the water-cement ratio and the addition of admixtures.. This  often involves an excessive degree of cross-linking or crystallization, making the material too brittle or difficult to process.明显的孔隙。)over-hardening, hyper-solidificationdify" (meaning "to become or make solid"), and the suffix "-ification" (meaning "the process of becoming").  Therefore, it literally means "the process of becoming excessively solid". The word’s origins trace back to the Latin word *solidus* (solid) and the verb *facere*(to make, to do).  The combining form "-ific" is derived from *facere* and signifies “making,causing to be".  "-ation" is a noun-forming suffix similar in function to "-tion".comprehensive understanding of the word "oversolidification."  Is there anything else I can assist you with?
