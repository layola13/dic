USAGE->词源
"Devour" comes from the Old French word "devorer," which in turn comes from the Latin "devorare," meaning "to swallow down," from "de-" (down) + "vorare" (to swallow).  The suffix "-ing" creates the present participle or gerund form, and "-ness" turns it into a noun indicating a state or quality. The plural form "devouringnesses" is relatively uncommon and might be considered awkward or overly formal in many contexts.  It emphasizes the repeated or habitual nature of the devouring action or quality.
