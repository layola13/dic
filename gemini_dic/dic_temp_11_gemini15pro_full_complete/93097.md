N/A  "-ied" itself is not a word that forms phrases. It is a grammatical inflection.


注意事项:

"-ied" is not a word in itself, but a suffix used to form the past tense and past participle of certain verbs.  Its pronunciation varies depending on the verb it is attached to.  It's important to note that not all verbs ending in "-ed" are pronounced /id/. For example, "looked" is pronounced /lʊkt/ and "played" is pronounced /pleɪd/.
