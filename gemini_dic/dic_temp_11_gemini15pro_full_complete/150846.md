The term "paragogy" itself refers to a process in linguistics where a sound or syllable is added to the end of aword. This is different from other morphological processes like prefixation (adding to the beginning) or infixation (adding within the word).   The addition might be a grammatical marker, phonetically driven, or due to other phonetic changes. Therefore a paragogical element isn't inherently meaningful itself; its meaning is derivedfrom what it modifies.For example, certain grammatical case endings in some ancient languages or dialectal features might be described as paragogical additions.  The term often implies some sort of redundancy or deviation from the standard form of the word., often between words. The resultant sounds usually don't correspond to any clear grammatical functions.**would be redundant and not useful in enhancing understanding of the word's meaning and usage.
