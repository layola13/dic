nempne:  (Not a recognized English word)

Since "nempne" isn't a real word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.  It's likely a typo or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it's intended to be a word, more context is needed to understand its meaning.

However, I can still demonstrate the requested format using a real word – "axiom":


axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；格言 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. |  Example:  "It is an axiom that supply equals demand."  供求相等是一条公理。| Synonyms:  principle, theorem,  | Antonyms: absurdity, paradox | noun
