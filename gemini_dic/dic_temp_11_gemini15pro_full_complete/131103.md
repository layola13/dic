PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically form common phrases. It's usually used on its own to modify a verb.)


词源：non- (prefix meaning "not") + bigoted + -ly (adverb suffix).  "Bigoted" comes from "bigot,"  ultimately from an unknown origin, possibly related to an oath sworn by Norman French occupying England.
