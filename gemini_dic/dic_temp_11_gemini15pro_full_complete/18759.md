berkelium: /bərˈkiːliəm/ | n. |锫|A radioactive metallic chemical element with atomic number 97, belonging to the actinoid series. It was the fifth transuranium element discovered, being first synthesized in 1949 at the University of California, Berkeley, from which it derives its name.|Berkelium is a synthetic element, meaning it is not found naturally on Earth. | 近义词: (As it's an element, it has no direct synonyms.  Perhaps 'actinide' or 'transuranium element' could be considered related terms.) | 反义词: None | 词性: noun
