词源:
Likely a popular dog name in the mid-20th century, possibly influenced by the name of Abraham Lincoln's dog, "Fido."  The name's popularity might also be attributed to its simple and friendly sound.  The exact origin remains somewhat uncertain.  It's speculated that it comes from the Latin word "fidus," meaning "faithful" or "trustworthy."
