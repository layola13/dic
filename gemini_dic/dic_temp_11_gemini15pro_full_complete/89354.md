homomallous:/ˌhɒməˈmæləs/ | adj. | 同形的，同型的 | Having the same form or structure.  Referring specifically to mosses where the gametophyte (the dominant, leafy part of the moss) and sporophyte (the stalk and capsule containing spores) grow on the same plant. | Example: The homomallous moss species had both leafy shoots and sporophytes clearly visible.  这种同形苔藓的叶状芽和孢子体都清晰可见。| Example:  In contrast to heteromallous mosses, homomallous mosses have sporophytes integrated into their leafy structure. 与异形苔藓相比，同形苔藓的孢子体与其叶状结构融为一体。 | Synonym: isomorphic (in a broader biological context), similar in form | Antonym: heteromallous |词性: 形容词
