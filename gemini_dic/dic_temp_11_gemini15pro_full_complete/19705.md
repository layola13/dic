bilinear:/ˌbaɪˈlɪniər/| adj.|双线性的|Relating to or involving two lines, typically used in mathematics to describe a function or expression that is linear in each of two variables when all other variables are held constant.  It essentially means "linear in each variable separately".|The bilinear interpolation method is commonly used in image processing.|近义词: linear (in a broader sense), twofold|反义词: nonlinear, multilinear|词性: adjective

bilinear:/ˌbaɪˈlɪniər/| n.|双线性形式|A function of two vectors that is linear in each vector when the other is held constant.|The dot product is a simple example of a bilinear form.|近义词: bilinear form|反义词: N/A|词性: noun (less common)
