PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Mulattress" is a noun referring to a person, so common phrases don't apply in the same way they do to more general words.  It's usage is generally straightforward and descriptive.

词源: From French *mulâtresse*, feminine of *mulâtre*, from Spanish *mulato*, from *mulo* (“mule”).  Ultimately from Latin *mulus*. The term is now considered outdated and offensive.  It's preferable to use terms like "mixed-race woman" or "biracial woman".
