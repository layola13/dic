词源：
"Outspurned" is derived from the prefix "out-" (meaning "outward" or "extending") and the past participle of the verb "spurn" (meaning "to reject with disdain" or "to kick or trample").  While the original meaning of "spurn" implies rejection, "outspurned" focuses on the outward extension or spreading motion, likely influenced by the visual imagery of something being pushed or kicked outward.
