词源:
The word "bikini" is named after Bikini Atoll, a group of islands in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, where the United States conducted nuclear weapon tests in the 1940s and 1950s. The French designer Louis Réard named his revealing two-piece swimsuit "bikini" in 1946, claiming it would be as explosive as the atomic bomb tests.
