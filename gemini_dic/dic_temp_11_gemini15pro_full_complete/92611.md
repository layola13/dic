ianthina:/aɪˈænθɪnə/ | n. | 紫螺，海蜗牛 | A genus of small, pelagic marine snails that float on the surface of the ocean by means of a raft of air bubbles held together by mucus. |  Example 1: The ianthina uses its mucus raft to trap air and stay afloat. 紫螺利用它的粘液筏来捕捉空气并保持漂浮。

Example 2: Ianthina are often found washed ashore after storms.  暴风雨过后，紫螺经常被冲到岸上。 | 近义词:  sea snail, pelagic snail | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps benthic snail - bottom-dwelling snail) | 词性: noun
