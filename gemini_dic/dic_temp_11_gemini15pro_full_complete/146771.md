Etymology:
From over- + hysterical.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively," and "hysterical" derives from the Greek "hystera" (womb), reflecting the ancient belief that emotional outbursts in women were caused by uterine disorders.  The meaning later broadened to encompass excessive emotionality in general.
