PHRASE->

No phrase exists using the word "co-omnipotent".  This word is typically used in formal theological or philosophical discussions and doesn't lend itself to common phrases.  It's more likely to be found within a sentence describing the nature of two or more deities or powerful entities.



词源:

"Co-" is a Latin prefix meaning "together" or "jointly".

"Omnipotent" comes from the Latin "omnipotens," meaning "all-powerful."  "Omni-" means "all," and "potens" means "powerful."


Therefore, "co-omnipotent" literally means "jointly all-powerful."
