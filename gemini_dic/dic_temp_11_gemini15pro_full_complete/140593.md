ETYMOLOGY->
From the ancient Greek and Roman custom of offering an olive branch as a symbol of peace.  The olive tree was sacred to Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, and represented peace and prosperity.  The dove carrying an olive branch back to Noah's Ark after the Great Flood further solidified the symbol's connection to peace and hope.
