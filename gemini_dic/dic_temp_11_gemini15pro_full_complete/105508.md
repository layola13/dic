kilogrammeter:/ˈkɪləɡræmˌmiːtər/| n.|千克米|A unit of work or energy equal to the work done in raising a mass of one kilogram through a vertical distance of one meter.|The kilogrammeter is an obsolete unit of energy.|近义词：joule|反义词: N/A|名词

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The kilogrammeter represents a specific amount of energy. = 千克米代表一定的能量。
Physicists rarely use the kilogrammeter now. = 物理学家现在很少使用千克米。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Scientists are phasing out the use of the kilogrammeter. = 科学家正在逐步淘汰千克米的使用。
They are adopting the joule as the standard unit of energy. = 他们正在采用焦耳作为能量的标准单位。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The joule has replaced the kilogrammeter in most applications. = 焦耳已在大多数应用中取代了千克米。
Scientists have largely abandoned the kilogrammeter. = 科学家们基本上已经放弃了千克米。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Researchers have been using joules instead of kilogrammeters for decades. = 几十年来，研究人员一直使用焦耳而不是千克米。
They have been advocating for the standardization of units. = 他们一直在倡导单位的标准化。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Engineers sometimes used the kilogrammeter in the past. = 工程师过去有时使用千克米。
The kilogrammeter served as a unit of energy before the joule became prevalent. = 在焦耳盛行之前，千克米曾作为能量单位。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Scientists were transitioning to the joule in the mid-20th century. = 科学家们在 20 世纪中叶过渡到焦耳。
They were seeking a more universally accepted unit of energy. = 他们正在寻找一个更普遍接受的能量单位。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The kilogrammeter had fallen out of favor by the late 20th century. = 到 20 世纪后期，千克米已经失宠。
Physicists had already adopted the joule as the standard unit. = 物理学家已经采用焦耳作为标准单位。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Scientists had been using the kilogrammeter for many years before the joule replaced it. = 在焦耳取代千克米之前，科学家们已经使用千克米很多年了。
They had been gradually moving towards a more standardized system of units. = 他们一直在逐渐走向一个更标准化的单位体系。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The kilogrammeter will likely remain obsolete. = 千克米可能会继续过时。
Textbooks will probably mention it only for historical context. = 教科书可能只会出于历史背景提及它。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Students will be learning about joules, not kilogrammeters, in physics classes. = 学生们将在物理课上学习焦耳，而不是千克米。
Scientists will be continuing to use the joule in their research. = 科学家们将继续在他们的研究中使用焦耳。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By 2100, the kilogrammeter will have become a largely forgotten unit. = 到 2100 年，千克米将成为一个很大程度上被遗忘的单位。
Science will have moved on to more consistent and internationally recognized units. = 科学将转向更一致和国际公认的单位。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the end of the century, scientists will have been using the joule for over a hundred years. = 到本世纪末，科学家们将已经使用焦耳超过一百年了。
They will have been relying on it for all their energy calculations. = 他们将一直依靠它进行所有的能量计算。


PHRASE->
N/A  (This is a scientific unit and doesn't typically appear in phrases.)


注意事项:
This word is largely obsolete and replaced by the Joule.  It's unlikely you would encounter this word in modern usage except in historical contexts.
