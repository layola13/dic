noncompositely:/ˌnɒnkəmˈpɒzɪtli/ | adv. | 非合成地，不可分解地 | In a way that is not composite or cannot be factored into smaller parts. |  The number 7 is noncompositely expressed as 7.  7这个数字非合成地表示为7。| The theorem deals with primes that are noncompositely represented in a certain form.  该定理处理以某种形式非合成表示的素数。 | 近义词: indecomposably, irreducibly | 反义词: compositely, decomposably | 词性: 副词

词源:  From "non-" (not) + "composite" (made up of distinct parts) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix). "Composite" ultimately derives from Latin "compōnere" (to put together).
