注意事项:
Although grammatically incorrect in formal writing, "I'm" can sometimes be followed by past participles to express a state of being, like "I'm finished" or "I'm done." These are common in informal speech.


While "I am" can be inverted for questions (Am I late?), this inversion is not used with the contraction "I'm" (*'M I late? is incorrect).  The full form must be used.
