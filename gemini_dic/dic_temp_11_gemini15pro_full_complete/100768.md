intravenouses:  This word is grammatically incorrect. The correct plural form of the noun "intravenous" is "intravenous infusions" or "intravenous injections" or simply "intravenouses" (less common).  As an adjective, it doesn't have a plural form.  Therefore, providing examples related to a non-existent word is not possible.  Instead, examples will be provided using "intravenous".
