PHRASE->
(While "mistas" isn't commonly used in modern English, here are some phrases using "Mrs." which could theoretically be pluralized in a similar archaic way if referring to multiple Mrs. at once, though this is highly unusual and not recommended.)

The mistas [Mrs.] Smith and Jones are here. 史密斯太太和琼斯太太在这里。(This is a more natural way to express this sentiment.)
Where are the mistas [Mrs.] going? 女士们要去哪里？(Again, "ladies" is more common.)
The mistas [Mrs.] have arrived. 女士们已经到了。 ("The ladies have arrived" is preferred.)
Please welcome the mistas [Mrs.] to the stage. 请欢迎女士们上台。 ("Please welcome the ladies to the stage" is preferred.)
Have you seen the mistas [Mrs.] lately? 你最近见过女士们吗？("Have you seen the ladies lately?" is preferred.)


注意事项:

"Mistas" is an archaic and non-standard plural of "Mrs."  It is not recommended for use in modern English.  "Ladies" or listing the names of the women is preferred.
