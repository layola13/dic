microparasite:/ˈmaɪkroʊˈpærəsaɪt/| n.|微寄生物|A parasite, such as a bacterium or virus, that multiplies within its host, typically within cells. Microparasites are characterized by their small size, short generation time, and direct transmission between hosts.|Malaria is caused by a microparasite transmitted by mosquitoes.|Synonyms: endoparasite, intracellular parasite|Antonyms: macroparasite|noun
