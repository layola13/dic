heygh 不是一个标准的英语单词。很可能是拼写错误，或许是想拼写 "height" 或 "hey"。 因此，我将分别解析这两个单词：

USAGE-> (Hey is primarily used as an interjection and does not typically follow grammatical tenses.)

PHRASE->
Hey there! = 你好！
Hey man! = 嘿，伙计！
Hey guys! = 嘿，伙计们！/大家好！
Hey you! = 嘿，你！

注意事项： "heygh" 真的不是一个单词。请检查拼写，并根据你的实际需求选择 "height" 或 "hey" 进行使用。
