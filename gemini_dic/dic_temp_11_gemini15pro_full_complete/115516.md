The word "manzour" isn't a standard English word. It appears to be a transliteration from another language, possibly Arabic (منظور manẓūr).  Therefore, a standard English dictionary entry can't be created.  However, based on its likely Arabic origin, I can offer an analysis based on that assumption:

manzour: /mænˈzuːr/ | adj. |  accepted, approved, intended, meant, in view, contemplated, considered |  Meaning:  This word carries the sense of something being approved, intended, or considered.  It can also describe something within one's sight or contemplation. | Example: The manzour outcome was a peaceful resolution. 预期的结果是和平解决。 | Example:  The garden was laid out as manzour in the original plans. 花园是按照最初计划中的构想布置的。 | Synonym: intended, planned, envisioned, foreseen | Antonym: unintended, unforeseen, unplanned | Word Type: Adjective
