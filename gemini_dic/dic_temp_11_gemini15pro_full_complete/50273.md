dephlegmation:/ˌdiːflɛɡˈmeɪʃən/ | n. | 去痰；冷凝；精馏 | The process of separating liquids with different boiling points by condensation.  This involves cooling a vapor to condense the higher-boiling components, while the lower-boiling components remain in the vapor phase. | Dephlegmation is essential in the production of spirits. 精馏在烈酒生产中至关重要。|  Dephlegmation is used to increase the alcohol content of a distillate.  精馏用于提高馏出液的酒精含量。| synonyms: condensation, fractionation, rectification | antonyms: vaporization, evaporation | noun


dephlegmator:/ˌdiːflɛɡˈmeɪtər/ | n. | 去痰药；冷凝器；分馏柱 | A device used in dephlegmation, typically a column or condenser that allows for the partial condensation and separation of vapors. | The dephlegmator returned the condensed liquid to the distillation still. 冷凝器将冷凝的液体返回到蒸馏釜中。 | The use of a dephlegmator improved the purity of the final product. 使用分馏柱提高了最终产品的纯度。 | synonyms: condenser, fractionating column, rectifier | antonyms: evaporator | noun
