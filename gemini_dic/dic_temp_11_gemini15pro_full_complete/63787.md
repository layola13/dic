epicycle: /ˈɛpɪˌsaɪk(ə)l/ | n. | 本轮; 周转圆 | A small circle whose center moves around the circumference of a larger one.  In ancient astronomy, epicycles were used to explain the apparent retrograde motion of planets. |  Ptolemy's model of the universe used epicycles to explain planetary orbits. 托勒密的宇宙模型用本轮来解释行星轨道。

The planet's strange movement was explained by the theory of epicycles.  这颗行星的奇怪运动用本轮理论来解释。 | 近义词: circle, orbit, loop | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "linear path") | 词性: noun
