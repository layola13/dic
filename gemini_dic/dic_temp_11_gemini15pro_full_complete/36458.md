词源:

The exact origin of "cold turkey" is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests that the pale, clammy skin of someone experiencing withdrawal resembles the skin of a plucked, uncooked turkey. Another proposes it comes from the straightforward, unembellished nature of cold turkey meat, comparing it to the directness of abruptly quitting.  A third theory connects it to the "cold turkey" slang of the early 20th century, meaning a blunt, straightforward statement or a hastily assembled meal, reflecting the abrupt nature of withdrawal.

用法说明:

"Cold-turkey" can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb.  As a noun, it refers to the act of abruptly quitting something.  As an adjective or adverb, it describes the abruptness of the action.  It's most commonly used in the context of addiction recovery but can apply to quitting any habit.
