hyperacuity:/ˌhaɪpərəˈkjuːɪti/ | n. | 超常敏锐；超常视力 |  The ability to perceive with greater resolution than would be predicted by the spacing of receptors in the sensory array. This means being able to discern details finer than the normal limits of acuity.  | Human beings possess hyperacuity in spatial vision, enabling them to see fine details much smaller than the size of photoreceptors in the eye. 人类在空间视觉上拥有超常敏锐的能力，能够看到比眼睛中感光细胞大小还要精细的细节。

Hyperacuity allows astronomers to align telescopes with incredible precision. 超常敏锐性使天文学家能够以令人难以置信的精度对准望远镜。 | 近义词: superacuity, ultra-acuity | 反义词: hypoacuity, low acuity | 词性: noun
