注意事项:

Devoir is a highly irregular verb in French.  The past simple forms (dus, dûmes, etc.) are literary and rarely used in spoken French. The conditional form (devrais, devrions, etc.) is often used to express advice or obligation ("should").  The present tense forms often express future obligation.  It’s important to note that the usage and conjugation of devoir can be complex, and consulting a comprehensive French grammar resource is recommended for a more in-depth understanding.
