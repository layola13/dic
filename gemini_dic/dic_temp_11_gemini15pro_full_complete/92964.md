/ˈɪdɪɛf/ |n.| 逆向文件频率 (Inverse Document Frequency) | A measure of how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is used in information retrieval and text mining.  It is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the word. |  The IDF of "the" is very low because it appears in almost every document. | 近义词: term frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: 名词

/ˈaɪˌdiːˈɛf/ |abbr.| 逆向文件频率 (Inverse Document Frequency) |  Abbreviation for Inverse Document Frequency.  It is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. | IDF is a key component of TF-IDF. | 近义词: tfidf | 反义词: N/A | 词性: 缩写
