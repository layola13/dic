adjective
狭口类;具有狭小口部的
Having a narrow mouth or aperture; specifically, designating certain nematodes (roundworms) in which the stoma (mouth) is not surrounded by prominent lips or other structures.
Angiostomous nematodes are often parasitic in their larval stages.  狭口线虫在其幼虫阶段通常是寄生的。
The researchers identified the parasite as an angiostomous nematode. 研究人员将这种寄生虫鉴定为一种狭口线虫。
近义词: narrow-mouthed
反义词:  (No direct antonym exists, but one could consider "wide-mouthed" as a contrasting term)
词性: adjective
