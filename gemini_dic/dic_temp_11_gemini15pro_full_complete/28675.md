ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cariōsitās, from Latin cariōsus (“rotten, decayed”), from cariēs (“rottenness, decay”).  While the connection seems odd, it likely arose from the sense of "a desire to investigate something to its core," even if it's unpleasant or "rotten."  Over time, the negative connotation faded, leaving only the desire to learn.
