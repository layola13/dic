词源： "Hold" comes from Old English "haldan," meaning "to hold, keep, grasp." "Fort" comes from Old French "fort" (masculine) and "forte" (feminine), meaning "strong," derived from Latin "fortis." The phrase "hold fort" originated as a military term, referring to defending a fortified position. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass maintaining any position, even metaphorically.
