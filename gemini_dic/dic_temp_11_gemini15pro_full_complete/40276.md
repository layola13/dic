PHRASE->

(Continuate is less commonly used than "continue" and generally doesn't form common phrases. It is more formal and less frequently encountered. Therefore, providing phrases with "continue" is more practical.)

continue with:  继续…
continue to: 继续做…
continue on:  继续下去
continue working: 继续工作
continue the discussion: 继续讨论


词源: From Late Latin continuatus, past participle of continuare  "to join together, connect, make continuous," from Latin continuus "holding together."


注意事项:

Continuate is an older and less common synonym for continue.  While grammatically correct,  "continue" is the preferred and more natural choice in modern English.
