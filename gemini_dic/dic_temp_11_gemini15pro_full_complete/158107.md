plastide:/ˈplæstɪd/| n. |质体，叶绿体|A plastid is a membrane-bound organelle found inthe cells of plants and algae. Plastids are responsible for manufacturing and storing food.  Different types of plastids exist, including chloroplasts (which contain chlorophylland carry out photosynthesis), chromoplasts (which contain pigments and contribute to the color of flowers and fruits), and leucoplasts (which store starch, lipids,or proteins).|Example: Chloroplasts are a type of plastid crucial for photosynthesis in plants. 叶绿体是一种对植物光合作用至关重要的质体。|近义词：organelle (细胞器)|反义词：无formed structures within plant cells. The suffix "-id" indicates a body or substance.  The term was coined in the late 19th century as biologists began to understand the structure and function of these organelles.cell biology. It is almost always used as a noun.  Its usage often involves describing the different types of plastids or their roles in cellular processes.  It's not a word commonly used in everyday conversation.，无法构成各种时态的句子。以下例句将使用与 plastid 相关的动词来展示不同时态):**have identified many different types of plastids. 研究人员已经发现了许多不同类型的质体。century. 生物学家们已经研究质体超过一个世纪了。们发现了质体在光合作用中的作用。* The cells were actively producing new plastids. 细胞正在活跃地产生新的质体。study, they had observed significant changes in plastid structure. 研究结束时，他们已经观察到质体结构的显著变化。质体功能的复杂性。质体实验的数据。他们将完成对质体遗传学的学习。have been studying the effects of climate change on plastids for a decade. 五年后，科学家们将已经研究气候变化对质体的影响十年了。发表时，他们将已经进行质体发育研究十五年了。" comprehensively, providing its pronunciation, part of speech, translation, detailed explanation, example sentences (using associated verbs to demonstrate tenses), synonyms, antonyms, and etymology.
