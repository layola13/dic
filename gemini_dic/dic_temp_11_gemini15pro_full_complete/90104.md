词源:  This phrase likely originated in the mid-20th century, possibly from the physical sensations associated with intense passion or exertion.  The "hot" likely refers to the increased body temperature associated with such feelings, while "heavy" suggests the weighty or serious nature of the situation.  There's no definitive etymological source, but the imagery is clear and evocative.
