ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *infanci*, from Old French *enfance*, from Latin *infantia* (“speechlessness, inability to speak, infancy”), from *infans* (“unable to speak, young”), from *in-* (“not”) + *fāns* (“speaking”), present participle of *for* (“to speak”).  The same root is seen in the words *infant*, *infantile*, and *fate* (from Latin *fātum*, “that which has been spoken”).
