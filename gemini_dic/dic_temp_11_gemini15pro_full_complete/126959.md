Etymology:  From narrow + minded + -ly.  "Narrow-minded" first appears in the early 17th century, combining the literal sense of "narrow" with "minded" to indicate a limited or inflexible mentality.  The adverbial form "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, describing the manner in which an action is performed.
