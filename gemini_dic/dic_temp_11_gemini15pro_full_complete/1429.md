USAGE->

词源：
This term likely originates from card games, specifically poker.  "Ace" refers to a high-value card, while "sleeve" might allude to cheating by hiding cards up one's sleeve.  Therefore, "ace-one-sleeve" suggests someone so skilled they appear to be cheating, even though they are not.  The exact origin is uncertain and likely colloquial.
