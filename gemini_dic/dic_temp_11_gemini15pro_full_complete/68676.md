PHRASE->
comic farcement 滑稽的闹剧
political farcement 政治闹剧
theatrical farcement  戏剧闹剧

stuff with farcement  用填料填充


词源：
Farcement comes from the Old French word "farcir," meaning "to stuff."  This relates to its primary meaning of filling or padding.  The secondary meaning of "farce" or "buffoonery" likely developed from the idea of stuffing something to an exaggerated degree, leading to a sense of absurdity.


注意事项:

由于farcement这个词本身就很少见，而且更多情况下会用其同源词farce来表示闹剧的意思，所以例句中更多的是在表达填充物的意思。  如果一定要表达闹剧，建议使用farce。
