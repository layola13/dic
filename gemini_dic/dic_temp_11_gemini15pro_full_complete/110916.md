lipocephala:/ˌlɪpoʊˈsɛfələ/ | n. |亲脂性；脂溶性 |  The tendency of a chemical compound to dissolve in fats, oils, lipids, and non-polar solvents.  A lipophilic substance is characterized by its affinity for lipids and its relative insolubility in water.  This property is important in pharmacology and toxicology, as lipophilic substances can readily cross cell membranes and accumulate in fatty tissues. | Certain vitamins, such as A, D, E, and K, are lipocephala and are stored in the body's fat.  许多维生素，如A、D、E和K，都是亲脂性的，并储存在体内的脂肪中。

Many pesticides are lipocephala, allowing them to persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in organisms. 许多杀虫剂是亲脂性的，这使得它们能够在环境中持久存在，并在生物体内积累。 | 近义词：lipophilic, fat-soluble | 反义词：hydrophilic, water-soluble | 词性：名词
