PHRASE->
nonsecretionary tumor 非分泌性肿瘤
nonsecretionary cells 非分泌性细胞
nonsecretionary lining 非分泌性内壁
nonsecretionary tissue 非分泌性组织
nonsecretionary gland 非分泌性腺体 (This phrase is somewhat contradictory, as glands are typically defined by their secretory function, but it can be used to describe a gland that has lost its secretory ability.)
