词源:  "Grint" likely comes from a variant of "grind," sharing the same Proto-Germanic root *grend-, meaning "to grind" or "to destroy by crushing."  This suggests the connection to the sound and action of grinding teeth. While "grind" is the more common and established word, "grint" survives primarily in dialectal or informal usage, particularly in Scotland and northern England.
