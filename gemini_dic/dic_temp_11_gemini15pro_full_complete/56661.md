ETYMOLOGY->
From *dough nut*, literally 'nut of dough'. The "nut" part likely refers to the original shape being similar to a nut, particularly before the hole became standard.  The spellings "donut" and "doughnut" are both considered correct, with "doughnut" being the original and slightly more formal.
