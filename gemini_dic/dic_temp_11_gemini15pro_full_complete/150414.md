##panselectionismənɪzəm/ | n. |泛选择论|泛选择论是一种进化生物学理论，认为自然选择作用于所有生物体的所有性状，而不仅仅是那些直接影响生存和繁殖的性状。它与适应论相对，适应论认为自然选择只作用于那些对适应性有直接贡献的性状。|The theory of panselectionism suggeststhat all traits, even seemingly neutral ones, are subject to natural selection.|近义词：universal selection|反义词：adaptationismparts:**selectionism**: This refers to the process of natural selection, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology.which focuses on the selective pressures driving the evolution of traits directly beneficial to survival and reproduction.  Panselectionists argue that seemingly neutral or slightly deleterious traits might still be subject to selective pressure through linkage disequilibrium (where genes are inherited together) or other indirect mechanisms.  Even seemingly random genetic drift, often seen as acounterpoint to selection, could be considered a form of selection at a population level. Debate continues about the relative strengths of panselectionism versus adaptationism,  with some proposing a synthesis where both processes play significant roles depending on the specific trait and environmental context.selectionism, arguing that even seemingly inconsequential traits are subject to evolutionary pressures.  一些生物学家支持泛选择论，认为即使是看似无关紧要的性状也受到进化压力的影响。泛选择论和适应论之间的争论仍然是进化生物学中一个有争议的问题。which focuses narrowly on traits directly enhancing fitness.  It often appears in scientific papers, textbooks, and discussions among evolutionary biologists debating the scope and influence of natural selection.  Understanding the subtleties of this term requires a grasp of fundamental concepts in population genetics and evolutionary theory.total selection (these are less common but convey similar meaning)way accessible to a broad audience.  Further investigation into the complexities of population genetics and related fields would provide a more in-depth understanding.
