词源：From Middle English *discoursour, from Anglo-Norman discursur, discursour, from Old French discourseor, from Late Latin discūrsōrem, accusative singular of discūrsor (“runner to and fro, speaker, orator”), from discūrsus, past participle of discūrrō (“run to and fro, speak, discourse”).


注意事项：discoursers是一个相对正式和不常用的单词，通常用于描述学术或正式场合的演讲者或论述者。在日常对话中，更常用的词是speakers, presenters, or lecturers.
