注意事项:  Since "cephalo-" is a combining form, it doesn't have antonyms or synonyms in the same way a standalone word does.  Instead, words containing "cephalo-" can have synonyms or antonyms. For example, "cranial" is a synonym in some contexts, and "caudal" is an antonym.  Also, "cephalo-" is primarily used in scientific or medical terminology and does not have common colloquial phrases associated with it.
