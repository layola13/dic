`/ˈɒksɪˈhaɪdrədʒən/ | n.| 氧氢；氧氢混合气 | 氧氢混合气体，是指由氧气和氢气组成的混合气体，通常用于焊接和切割金属。其燃烧时产生高温火焰，可达到3000℃以上。 | Example: Oxyhydrogen torches are used in welding and cutting. (氧氢焊枪用于焊接和切割。) | 近义词：hydrogen-oxygen mixture | 反义词：无  | 名词`or "pointed," referring to oxygen's sharp smell and reactive nature) and "hydrogen" (from Greek *hydro* meaning "water" and *genes* meaning "producing").  Therefore, the word literally means "water-producingoxygen," referring to the fact that when oxygen and hydrogen burn, they produce water.Its use highlights the specific composition of the gas mixture, emphasizing both the oxygen and hydrogen components.  Unlike simply saying "hydrogen and oxygen," "oxyhydrogen" implies a carefully mixed ratio for a specific purpose, typically for high-temperature applications. The term implies a controlled mixture suitable for combustion, not just a randommixture of the two gases.Safety precautions are essential when handling and using oxyhydrogen. (操作和使用氧氢时必须注意安全预防措施。)welding or cutting metal using an oxyhydrogen torch.onym in the linguistic sense.
