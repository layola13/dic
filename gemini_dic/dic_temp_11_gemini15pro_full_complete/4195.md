airflows:/ˈɛərˌfloʊz/| n.|气流|The movement of air.  The pattern of air circulation in a particular space.|例句：The airflows in the room were disrupted by the open window. 房间里的气流被打开的窗户打乱了。

例句：Proper airflows are essential for efficient ventilation.  适当的气流对于有效的通风至关重要。|近义词：currents, drafts, ventilation|反义词:stagnation, stillness|词性:名词

词源: airflow 源自 air（空气）+ flow（流动）。Air 源自古英语 ær，而 flow 源自古英语 flowan。
