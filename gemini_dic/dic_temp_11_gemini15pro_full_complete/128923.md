词源：
The origin of "nincompoop" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the 17th century.  Some speculate it's a humorous formation, possibly influenced by "non compos mentis" (Latin for "not of sound mind").  Others suggest a connection to "Nicompoop," a character in a 17th-century play.  Regardless of its precise origin, the word has consistently denoted a foolish or silly person.
