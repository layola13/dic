ETYMOLOGY->
From "coop" (n.), from Middle English *coupe*, from Old French *cope*, *coupe* "a cask, tub, barrel; a hen coop," from Latin *cupa* "a tub, cask, vat."  The sense of confinement arose from the use of coops to enclose animals. The addition of "up" intensifies the feeling of being restricted.
