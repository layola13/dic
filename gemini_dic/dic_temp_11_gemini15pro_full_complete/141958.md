Etymology:

The origin of the name "Oregon" is uncertain.  Several theories exist, including derivations from French, Spanish, Native American languages, and even a misreading of a map.  One prominent theory suggests it comes from the French word "Ouragan" (hurricane), possibly referring to strong winds on the Columbia River.  Another theory proposes it originates from a Shoshone Indian word.  Ultimately, the true etymology remains a mystery.
