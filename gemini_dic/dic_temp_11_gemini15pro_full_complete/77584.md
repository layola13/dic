注意事项:  Since "Gedd's" is a relatively obscure term, there's less flexibility in its usage compared to common words.  It's primarily found in academic or specialized contexts related to statistics.  It's also important to note that without more context, it's difficult to provide a more detailed etymological breakdown. It likely derives from the name of the individual who developed the method.
