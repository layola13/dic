inherse:/ɪnˈhɜːrs/ | adj. | 内在的，固有的 | Existing as an essential constituent or characteristic; intrinsic. |  The inherse value of education is undeniable.  教育的内在价值是不可否认的。 | 近义词：intrinsic, innate, inherent, built-in | 反义词：extrinsic, acquired, external | 词性:形容词
词源: From in + herse (from Old French hercier "to harrow," from herce "harrow"). Originally referred to something sown deeply, hence firmly established or inherent. Over time, the spelling shifted to "inherse." While less common than "inherent," it retains the same basic meaning.
