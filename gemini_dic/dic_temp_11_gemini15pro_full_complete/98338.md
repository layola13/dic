ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin insinuare "to introduce by windings and turnings," from Latin in- "into" + sinuare "to bend, curve," from sinus "curve, fold, bend."  The original meaning was literal, "to wind or worm one's way into," later acquiring the figurative sense of introducing an idea indirectly.
