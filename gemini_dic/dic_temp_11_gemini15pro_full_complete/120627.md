ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (prefix meaning "wrong" or "bad") + class (verb meaning "to categorize").  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-"  meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," which is related to Old High German "miss-" and Old Norse "mis-". The word "class" comes from Old French "classe" from Latin "classis" meaning "a division of the people, army, fleet, etc."
