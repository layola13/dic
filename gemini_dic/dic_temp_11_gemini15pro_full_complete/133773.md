nongelatinously:/nɒn-dʒɪˈlætɪnəsli/ | adj. | 非胶状的，非凝胶状的 | Not having the consistency or appearance of gelatin; not gelatinous. | The liquid was nongelatinously smooth.  这种液体很光滑，不是胶状的。 |The substance was nongelatinously thick.  这种物质很稠，但不是胶状的。 | 近义词: nonviscous, fluid | 反义词: gelatinous, viscous | 词性: adjective

词源:
The word "nongelatinously" is derived from the adjective "gelatinous," which means having the consistency of gelatin. The prefix "non-" negates the meaning of "gelatinous," resulting in "nongelatinously," meaning not having the characteristics of gelatin. "Gelatinous" itself comes from "gelatin," ultimately from the Latin "gelare," meaning "to freeze."
