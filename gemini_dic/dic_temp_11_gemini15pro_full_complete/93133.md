词源:  From "igasur" (assumed, possibly a back-formation from "igasuria," a hypothetical noun meaning "gastric acidity") + "-ic" (adjective-forming suffix).  "Igasur" itself likely derives from the Greek "gaster" (γαστήρ), meaning "stomach," with a possible influence from Latin "acidus," meaning "sour" or "sharp."  The form "igasuria" does not appear to be attested in established medical terminology.  The word "igasuric" itself is not a standard medical or English term and likely represents a neologism or a misconstruction.  It's recommended to use established terms like "gastric," "hyperacid," or "acidic" instead.
