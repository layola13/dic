词源:  "Open source" as a term originated in the late 1990s,  specifically  during a strategy session held in Palo Alto, California, in February 1998,  organized by  Christine Peterson  in response to Netscape's announcement to release the source code for Navigator.  The term was chosen deliberately to avoid the potentially negative connotations of "free software,"  which  emphasized  freedom  but  could  be  misinterpreted  as  implying  lack  of  quality or cost. The term gained wider usage as the open-source movement grew.
