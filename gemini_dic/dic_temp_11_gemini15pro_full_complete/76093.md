Etymology:
From the noun "furrow" (a long narrow trench made in the ground by a plow), from Old English *furh, from Proto-Germanic *furχō, from Proto-Indo-European *perkʷ-  ("to furrow, to scratch").  The past participle form "furrowed" emerged to describe something marked with furrows or wrinkles.
