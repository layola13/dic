词源: From mawkish + -ness.  Mawkish itself comes from the Middle Low German *malsc weak, sickly (related to Middle Dutch malsc soft, overripe) influenced by the obsolete adjective mawk maggot.  Originally, mawkish referred to a sickly sweet taste or smell, and later evolved to describe overly sentimental or insincere emotions.
