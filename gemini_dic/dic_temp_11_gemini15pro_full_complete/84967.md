PHRASE->

Since "happ" isn't a standalone word, it doesn't form phrases in the same way other words do.  However, here are examples using words containing "happ":

1. What happened? = 发生了什么事？
2.  A mishap occurred. =  发生了一起事故。
3.  Perhaps he'll be happy about it. = 也许他会为此感到高兴。
4.  It was a happy accident.  = 这是一个美好的意外。
5.  That's a happy coincidence! =  真是个幸运的巧合！

注意事项:


As noted throughout, "happ" is not a standalone word in modern English. It's likely either a shortened form of "happy" or being used as a root.  Therefore, standard grammatical conjugations and examples don't apply in the same way.
