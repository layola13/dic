Etymology: From Middle English *losen, from Old English *lōsian (“to become loose, be lost”), from Proto-Germanic *lausaną (“to lose, perish”), from Proto-Indo-European *lew- (“to loosen, separate, divide”).  The -en suffix makes it a verb.  The -s ending marks it as the third-person singular present tense form.
