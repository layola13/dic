PHRASE-> (oohs is rarely used in set phrases.  It's more of a spontaneous exclamation.)
oohs and aahs = 惊叹声
lets out a series of oohs = 发出一连串的惊叹声


注意事项:  As 'oohs' is primarily an interjection and not a formal word, it doesn't have typical grammatical applications like passive voice or subjunctive mood in the same way a verb or noun would.  The usage examples focus on demonstrating how it can be integrated into different tenses to convey the timing of the exclamation.
