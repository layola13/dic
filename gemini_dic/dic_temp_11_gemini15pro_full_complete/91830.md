hypergeneticalness's:/ˌhaɪpərˌdʒɛnˈɛtɪkəlnəsɪz/ | n. | 超遗传性的状态 | The quality or state of being hypergenetical (excessively influenced by heredity).  This word is extremely rare and likely coined.  It refers to an extreme or exaggerated degree of influence from genetic factors. |  It's difficult to find a natural-sounding sentence for "hypergeneticalness's" due to its rarity.  A contrived example:  The researcher argued for the hypergeneticalness's of the trait, claiming environmental factors played a negligible role. | 近义词: heritability, genetic predisposition | 反义词: environmental influence | 词性: noun
