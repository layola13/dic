The word "bannses" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  However, if you meant "bannest" or "bans", I can offer information on those.  Please clarify which word you intended.

Assuming you meant **bans (third-person singular present of ban)**:

bans /bænz/
| v. | 禁止，取缔 | Prohibits or forbids something, especially officially. | The government bans smoking in public places. 政府禁止在公共场所吸烟。| The school bans cell phones during class. 学校禁止学生在上课期间使用手机。 | forbids, prohibits, proscribes | permits, allows | verb
