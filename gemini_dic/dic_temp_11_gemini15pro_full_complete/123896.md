ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *mordant (present participle of mordre “to bite”), from Latin mordēns, present participle of mordēre “to bite.”  The sense of "corrosive" developed from the idea of "biting" and was later applied figuratively to sharp or biting remarks. The use of mordants in dyeing arose from their ability to "bite" into or fix onto fabrics.
