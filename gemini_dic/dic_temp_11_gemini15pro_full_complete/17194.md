ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *balk*, from Old Norse *balkr* ("ridge, partition, beam"), from Proto-Germanic *balkaz* ("beam, pole, tree trunk"). Cognate with Old English *balca* ("beam"), Dutch *balk* ("beam"), German *Balken* ("beam"). The semantic shift from "beam" to "obstacle" likely arose from the idea of a beam blocking a path.
