##ovule:/ˈoʊvjuːl/| n. |胚珠|of seed plants that contains the female reproductive cell (the egg cell).  After fertilization, the ovule develops into a seed. Ovules are typically small,and their structure varies depending on the plant species. They are enclosed within the ovary, which provides protection and nourishment. The ovule's integuments (protectiveouter layers) surround the nucellus, a nutritive tissue that supports the megagametophyte (female gametophyte, also called the embryo sac), which contains the egg cell. The micropyle is a small opening in theinteguments through which the pollen tube enters during fertilization.  The process of ovule development is crucial for sexual reproduction in seed plants, leading to the formation of seeds that contain the embryo, endosperm (food source), and seed coat.ules' development under a microscope. 植物学家仔细解剖花朵以在显微镜下观察胚珠的发育。gametophyte (in a less specific sense), megasporangium.ovulum," the diminutive of "ovum," meaning "egg."  This reflects the ovule's role as the structure containing the female reproductive cell, analogous to an egg cell.  The suffix "-ule" indicates smallness.  The evolution of the term reflects the historical understanding of plant reproduction and the analogydrawn between plant and animal reproductive structures.reproduction.
