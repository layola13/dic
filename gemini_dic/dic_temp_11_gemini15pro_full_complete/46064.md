cycloidei:/ˌsaɪklɔɪˈdiːaɪ/ | n. | 圆鳞鱼类 |  A taxonomic group (suborder) of bony fishes characterized by having cycloid scales, which are smooth and rounded.  These scales are thin, flexible, and overlapping, giving the fish a smooth exterior. | Example: The perch and the salmon are examples of cycloidei.  河鲈和鲑鱼是圆鳞鱼类的例子。| Example: Many common freshwater fish belong to the cycloidei suborder. 许多常见的淡水鱼属于圆鳞鱼亚目。 | Synonym: soft-rayed fishes (in part - as cycloid scales can also be found in some spiny-rayed fish)| Antonym:  ctenoidei (fish with ctenoid scales)| noun
