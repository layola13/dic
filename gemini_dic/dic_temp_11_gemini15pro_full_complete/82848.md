注意事项:
词源:  "gulgul" likely comes from Hindi or another related Indo-Aryan language, possibly onomatopoeic, reflecting the round shape or the act of swallowing.  Its usage in English is primarily limited to specialized contexts like ornithology or discussions of Indian cuisine and medicine.  There isn't a readily available detailed etymology tracing it back to Proto-Indo-European roots.
