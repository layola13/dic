The word "jemlah" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It is likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect, or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe it means, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.  

For example, if you meant "jumlah" (which is Indonesian/Malay for "total" or "sum"), I can provide an analysis for that word.

Since I cannot analyze "jemlah," I will use the word "what" as an example to demonstrate the requested format.
