ooesperm: /ˌoʊoʊˈspɜːrm/ | n. | 卵子 | An egg, especially of a large size, as that of a bird, reptile, or fish.  This spelling is archaic and now considered incorrect. The correct spelling is **oocyte** or **ovum**. |  *(No valid examples can be provided using "ooesperm" as it's an incorrect spelling.  Here are examples using the correct terms "oocyte" and "ovum":)*

The oocyte matures in the ovary before being released during ovulation. 卵母细胞在卵巢中成熟，然后在排卵期间释放。

The ovum is fertilized by a sperm to form a zygote. 卵子受精后形成受精卵。 | 近义词: oocyte, ovum, egg | 反义词: sperm (in the context of reproduction) | 词性: noun

Etymology: From the Greek words *ōón* (egg) and *sperma* (seed).  The combination is etymologically flawed, resulting in a redundant and ultimately incorrect term.
