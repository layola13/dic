The musicians were able to improvise interperceptually, creating a seamless and harmonious performance. 音乐家们能够相互感知地即兴创作，创造出无缝和谐的表演。 | 近义词:  intersubjectively, jointly, mutually | 反义词: individually, separately, independently | 词性: 副词

词源:  "Inter-" (between) + "perceptual" (relating to perception) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  The word combines the prefix "inter-" denoting "between" or "among" with "perceptual," derived from "perception," which ultimately comes from the Latin "perceptio" meaning "a taking in" or "apprehension." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "interperceptual" into an adverb.
