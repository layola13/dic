词源:  From Greek *nēphalios "sober, temperate," from *nē- "not" + *phal- related to "intoxicated."  来自希腊语 *nēphalios “清醒的，节制的”，源自 *nē- “不” + *phal- 与“陶醉的”相关。  The word is essentially a back-formation from the adjective "nephalism" which means "sobriety," creating the opposite meaning.  这个词本质上是从形容词“nephalism”（意为“清醒”）的反向构词，创造了相反的含义。
