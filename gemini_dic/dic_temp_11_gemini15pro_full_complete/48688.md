deffest:/ˈdefɪst/ | adj. | 最棒的，最厉害的，最酷的 | Superlative form of "def," slang for "cool," "awesome," or "excellent."  It emphasizes something being extremely good or impressive. | Example: That concert was deffest gig I've ever been to! 那场音乐会是我看过的最棒的演出！

词源:  "Deffest" is derived from "def," which itself is a shortened form of "definitely."  Over time, "def" transitioned from meaning "definitely" to becoming a slang term for "cool" or "awesome," particularly in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and youth culture.  "Deffest" then emerged as the superlative form of "def."
