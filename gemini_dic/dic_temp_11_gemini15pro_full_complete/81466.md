PHRASE->
While "gratulate" can technically be used on its own, it's almost always followed by "on" to indicate the reason for the congratulation.  Therefore, the most common "phrase" is "gratulate on."

"Gratulate someone on something"  祝贺某人某事
"Gratulate someone on their achievement" 祝贺某人的成就
"Gratulate someone on their success" 祝贺某人的成功
"Gratulate someone on their good fortune" 祝贺某人的好运
"Gratulate someone on their marriage" 祝贺某人的婚姻

注意事项:
"Gratulate" is less common than "congratulate" in modern English. While grammatically correct, it might sound slightly archaic or formal in everyday conversation.  "Congratulate" is generally preferred.
