orthotopically:/ˌɔːrθəˈtɑːpɪkli/| adv.|原位地，同位地|In the normal or usual place; situated in the place or position proper to it.  Relating to the grafting of tissue in its normal anatomical location.|The tumor cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of the mice.  肿瘤细胞被原位注射到小鼠的乳腺脂肪垫中。|近义词：in situ, in position|反义词：heterotopically, ectopically|词性:副词
