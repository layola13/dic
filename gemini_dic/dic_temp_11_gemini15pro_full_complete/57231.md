词源:  "downgyved" is a likely misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) based on "downvoted".  "Downvote" itself is a combination of "down" and "vote," reflecting the act of giving a negative vote.  The "-gyved" ending likely doesn't have a specific etymological root and might be a mistaken variation.
