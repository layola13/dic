Etymology:
From girl + -ish.  "girl" comes from Middle English *girle*, of uncertain origin, perhaps related to Low German *gör*, girl, child. "-ish" is a suffix forming adjectives from nouns, with the sense "of, relating to, or resembling" (as in childish, foolish); also forming adjectives from other adjectives, with the sense "somewhat, tending to" (as in greenish, smallish); also forming adjectives from verbs, with the sense "given to, tending to" (as in bookish, freakish).
