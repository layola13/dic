Etymology:
From Late Latin *diligens, diligent-, present participle of diligere "to love, esteem, value highly; single out, select," from dis- "apart" (see dis-) + legere "choose, gather, select, read" (see lecture (n.)). The sense evolution is from "loving" something, to "taking care of" it, to "paying attention to" it, hence "careful, attentive, painstaking."
