ETYMOLOGY->
"bone," meaning "study intensely," originated in the late 19th century.  While the exact origin is uncertain, one theory suggests it relates to the image of a dog gnawing on a bone with persistent effort, thus transferring the idea of diligent work to studying. Another theory proposes a connection to "bone" meaning "dice," implying learning by rote or "boning up" on facts as if memorizing the faces of dice.
