ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French contempt, contempte, from Latin contemptus, past participle of contemnere "to scorn, despise, disdain, contemn," from con- "completely" + temnere "to scorn," related to Greek temnein "to cut." The sense evolution is from "despise" to "disregard" to "violate" (a law, etc.).
