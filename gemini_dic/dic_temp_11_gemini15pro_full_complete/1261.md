ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *acorder* (meaning "to agree, to reconcile"), itself from Latin *accordāre* (meaning "to make agree, to bring to agreement, to make of one heart"), from *ad-* (meaning "to") + *cor, cord-* (meaning "heart"). The sense of "to tune" developed later, presumably from the idea of bringing strings into harmony.
