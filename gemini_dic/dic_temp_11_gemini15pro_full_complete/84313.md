词源:  "Half-" (Old English healf) + "willfulness" (from "willful" + "-ness").  "Willful" comes from Old English "willfull," meaning "obstinate, headstrong."  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns from adjectives.  Thus, "half-willfulness" literally means a state of being partially or halfway willful or obstinate.
