词源: From Middle English *broden*, from Old English *brōd* (“brood, offspring, the young of birds hatched at once”), from Proto-Germanic *brōdō* (“a bringing forth, brood”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰreh₁- (“to swell, sprout, grow”).  The original sense referred to a bird sitting on eggs. The figurative sense of "ponder moodily" arose from the image of a bird sitting silently on its nest.
