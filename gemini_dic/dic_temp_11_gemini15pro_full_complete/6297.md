amorphozoa:/əˌmɔːrfoʊˈzoʊə/
noun
变形虫类
A taxonomic group of amoeboid protists characterized by the absence of flagella, cilia, or other prominent locomotory organelles.
Amoebozoa are a major taxonomic group containing about 2,400 described species of amoeboid protists.  They lack flagella and cilia, and move by using pseudopodia.
近义词:amoebas, amoeboids
反义词: (No direct antonym, as it's a taxonomic classification.  Potentially could contrast with flagellates or ciliates, which have different locomotion methods).
词性:n.
