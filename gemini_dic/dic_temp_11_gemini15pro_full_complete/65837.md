eviration:  This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.

However, if you're interested in exploring how new words are formed, I can provide information on common word formation processes in English, such as:

* **Derivation:** Adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., unhappy, kindness)
* **Compounding:** Combining two or more existing words (e.g.,  rainforest,  laptop)
* **Blending:** Combining parts of two words (e.g., smog from smoke and fog, brunch from breakfast and lunch)
* **Back-formation:** Creating a new word by removing a supposed affix (e.g., edit from editor,  donate from donation)
* **Acronyms:** Forming words from the initial letters of a phrase (e.g.,  laser,  scuba)
* **Borrowing:** Adopting words from other languages (e.g.,  karaoke,  taco)


Please let me know if you'd like more information on any of these.
