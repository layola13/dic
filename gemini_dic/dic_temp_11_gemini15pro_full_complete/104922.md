The word "kejia" is not a recognized English word. It might be a misspelling, a name, a technical term specific to a certain field, or a word from another language.  Since it's not an English word, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you could provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word, what language you think it might be), I might be able to offer more assistance.

If you meant "Kijia," which is a brand name, I still can't provide a standard lexical analysis as brand names don't typically have dictionary entries.


Since I cannot analyze "kejia", I will demonstrate the required format using the word "question."
