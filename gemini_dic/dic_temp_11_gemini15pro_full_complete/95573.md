incombine:/ˌɪnkəmˈbaɪn/ | adj. | 不可结合的，不能结合的 | Not able to be combined; incompatible. |  This chemical is incombine with water. 这种化学物质与水不相容。|  The two theories are incombine. 这两种理论不相容。 | 近义词：incompatible, uncombinable, unmixable | 反义词：compatible, combinable, mixable | 词性: 形容词

词源:  "in-" (not) + "combine" (to join or mix together). The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "combine," resulting in the meaning "not able to be combined."
