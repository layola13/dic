"Heuk" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more information.

However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage with the word "what", I will provide that information below.  Keep in mind that these examples use "what" correctly, but I cannot incorporate "heuk" as it's not a recognized word.
