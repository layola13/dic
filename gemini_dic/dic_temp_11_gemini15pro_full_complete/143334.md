词源:  "Outedging" is likely a  neologism or a less common variant of "outgoing."  "Outgoing" comes from the phrasal verb "go out," meaning to leave one's home or usual environment for social activities.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective describing someone who actively "goes out" socially.  While "outedging" is less established, it likely follows the same derivational pattern, emphasizing the act of "edging out" of one's comfort zone to engage with others.
