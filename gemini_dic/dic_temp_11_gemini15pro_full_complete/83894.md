词源: "Half-arsed" (and its variant "half-assed") likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. It is a colloquialism, meaning it is informal and used primarily in spoken language.  The word "arse" (or "ass") refers to the buttocks, and "half-arsed" implies that only half of one's backside is engaged in the task, suggesting a lack of full commitment or effort.  The word is considered vulgar by some, so its use should be limited to informal settings.
