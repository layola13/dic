nonfraudulences: /ˌnɒnˈfrɔːdjʊlənsɪz/ | n. | 无欺诈行为; 真实性 | Absence of fraud; genuineness. This word is grammatically unusual as "fraudulence" usually isn't pluralized and the prefix "non-" typically forms adjectives, not nouns.  It is more common and natural to use phrases like "lack of fraudulence" or "absence of fraud." |  Due to its unusual nature, constructing natural-sounding examples is difficult. A contrived example could be: "The auditor confirmed the nonfraudulences of the transactions."  This would be better phrased as: "The auditor confirmed that the transactions were not fraudulent." | Near synonyms: legitimacy, validity, honesty, integrity | Antonyms: fraud, deceit, dishonesty, deception | noun
