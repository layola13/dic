Etymology:
From Middle French *aludel*, from Medieval Latin *aludel*, from Arabic *al-’uṭhull* (الإثمد), from Ancient Greek *ἀθύρμαλλος* (*athýrmallos*, “soot”), from *ἄθυρμα* (*áthyrma*, “soot”) + *μαλλός* (*mallós*, “fleece”). The original sense referred to a woolly substance collected in the chimney.
