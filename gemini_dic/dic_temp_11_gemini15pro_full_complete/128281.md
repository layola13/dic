neuropore: /ˈnjʊərəˌpɔːr/ /ˈnʊrəˌpɔːr/
noun
神经孔
An opening in the neural tube of a developing embryo.  The anterior neuropore closes first, and the posterior neuropore closes soon after.
The anterior neuropore failed to close properly in the embryo, leading to a neural tube defect.
anterior neuropore, posterior neuropore
None
None
