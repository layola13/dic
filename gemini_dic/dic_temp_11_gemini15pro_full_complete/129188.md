nobelium:/noʊˈbɛliəm/ | n. | 诺贝lium | A synthetic chemical element with symbol No and atomic number 102. It is named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and founder of the Nobel Prize. | Nobelium is a radioactive element and is not found naturally on Earth. It is created artificially in nuclear reactors. |  近义词: (As a chemical element, it has no direct synonyms.  Perhaps "transuranium element" or "synthetic element" could be considered related.) | 反义词: (No antonyms for a chemical element.) | 词性: noun

nobeliums: /noʊˈbɛliəmz/ | n. | 诺贝lium（复数形式，通常不用于科学语境）|  Plural form of "nobelium," referring to multiple atoms or isotopes of the element. Rarely used in scientific context.  | The researcher was studying different isotopes of nobeliums. (This usage is unusual.) | 近义词: (Same as nobelium) | 反义词: (Same as nobelium) | 词性: noun
