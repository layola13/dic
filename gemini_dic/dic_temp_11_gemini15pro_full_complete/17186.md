baud:/bɔːd/| n.|波特；调制速率|A unit of signaling speed equal to the number of discrete signal events per second.  It is the reciprocal of the duration of the shortest signaling element in the modulation.  One baud therefore corresponds to a rate of one signal element per second.  The baud rate and the bit rate are not always the same.|The modem operated at 14,400 baud.  该调制解调器以 14,400 波特运行。|Synonyms: symbol rate, signal rate|Antonyms: N/A|noun
