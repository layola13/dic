differentiabilities:/ˌdɪfərɛnʃiəˈbɪlətiz/| n.|可微性|The quality or state of being differentiable; the number of times a function can be differentiated.  This refers to the property of a function that allows it to have a derivative at every point in its domain.|The differentiabilities of this function are complex due to its piecewise nature.|近义词: derivability, smoothness|反义词: non-differentiability|词性: Noun

词源: From "differentiable" + "-ity" (suffix forming abstract nouns denoting a state or quality). "Differentiable" comes from "differentiate" + "-able" (suffix indicating capability). "Differentiate" comes from Late Latin "differentiare," meaning "to distinguish."
