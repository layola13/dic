coarticulation: /ˌkoʊɑːrˌtɪkjəˈleɪʃən/ | n. |  协同发音，共调 | The overlapping of articulatory movements during speech production, so that the pronunciation of one sound is influenced by the preceding and following sounds. |  Example: The "t" in "butter" is often pronounced as a glottal stop due to coarticulation.  "黄油"中的"t"由于协同发音经常被发成喉塞音。| Example: Coarticulation makes speech faster and more fluent. 协同发音使讲话更快、更流利。| Synonym: assimilation, blending | Antonym:  (No direct antonym) | noun


coarticulate: /ˌkoʊɑːrˈtɪkjəleɪt/ | v. | 协同发音，共调 | To pronounce (a speech sound) so that its articulation overlaps with that of an adjacent speech sound. | Example:  When we speak quickly, we tend to coarticulate sounds. 当我们说得很快时，我们倾向于协同发音。| Example:  The way vowels are coarticulated can change depending on the surrounding consonants. 元音协同发音的方式会根据周围的辅音而改变。 | Synonym: blend, merge (in pronunciation) | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | verb
