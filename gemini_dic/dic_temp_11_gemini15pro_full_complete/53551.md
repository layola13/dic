From disbandment (singular) + -s (plural suffix).
Disbandment comes from the verb "disband," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart," "reversal," or "negation") and the verb "band" (meaning "to unite in a company or group"). Ultimately, it traces back to the Proto-Germanic "*band-" (something tied).
