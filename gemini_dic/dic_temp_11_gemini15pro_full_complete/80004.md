Etymology: "Go online" is a relatively recent phrase, emerging with the rise of the internet in the late 20th century. "Go" is a common Germanic verb meaning "to move from one place to another," while "online" is an adjective and adverb describing a state of being connected to a computer network or the internet.  "On-lines," while less common, retains this connection to the original meaning of becoming connected.
