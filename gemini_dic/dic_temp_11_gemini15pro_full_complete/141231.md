ootype:/ˈoʊ.ə.taɪp/
noun
卵模
A structure in the reproductive system of many flatworms and some other invertebrates, in which eggs are assembled and packaged, often with yolk and a shell.
The ootype is a specialized region of the female reproductive tract where the egg is formed.
The ootype plays a crucial role in egg shell formation.
Synonyms: egg mold, egg capsule forming organ
Antonyms: N/A
n.
