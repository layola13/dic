##oxygenation:/ˌɒksɪdʒəˈneɪʃən/| n. | 氧合作用，充氧 |:** The process of combining or supplying with oxygen.  This term is commonly used in medical and biological contexts, referring to the process by which oxygen is introduced intoand utilized by living tissues.  It can also refer to the process of adding oxygen to a substance or environment.1:**  The patient's low blood oxygen levels necessitated immediate oxygenation.  (病人的血氧水平过低，需要立即进行氧合治疗。)crucial for cell survival. (组织的有效氧合作用对细胞存活至关重要。)γίγνομαι), meaning "to generate," because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was essential to the formation of all acids. The suffix "-ation" indicates a process or action. Therefore, "oxygenation" literally means "the process of making or becoming oxygenated."" is primarily used as a noun.  It's a relatively formal term and is usually found in scientific or medical contexts. It's not commonly used in everyday conversation. While not directly a verb, the process itself implies an action (the act of oxygenating something).  You would not typically say "Ioxygenated the water," but rather "I oxygenated the water *by adding air*."  The verb form related to "oxygenation" is more commonly "to oxygenate", which is more broadly applicable.  For example: "The lungs oxygenate the blood."importance of oxygenation has significantly evolved since Lavoisier's time.  Modern understanding highlights its critical role in numerous biological processes, including cellular respiration, energy production, and the maintenance of overall health. Inadequacies in oxygenation can lead to various health problems, from mild fatigue to life-threatening conditions.Measuring and monitoring oxygenation levels are essential parts of medical care, exemplified by methods such as pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis. Various medical interventions and technologies focus on improving oxygenation, such as supplemental oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
