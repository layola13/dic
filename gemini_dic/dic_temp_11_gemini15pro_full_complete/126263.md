Note: While *myelocoele* is sometimes used interchangeably with *myelomeningocele*, *myelomeningocele* is the more precise and commonly used term for the condition where the spinal cord itself protrudes.  Myelocoele can refer to a broader category of spinal defects.  I have included both terms and their usage for clarity.
