alkalimetry: /ˌæl.kəˈlɪ.mə.tri/ | n. | 碱量滴定法；碱定量法 | the measurement of the amount of alkali (a base) in a solution. It is a type of volumetric analysis where a known concentration of acid is used to neutralize the alkali, and the volume of acid used determines the amount of alkali present.  |  Alkalimetry was used to determine the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the sample.  碱量滴定法被用来测定样品中氢氧化钠的浓度。 | synonyms: acid-base titration, neutralization titration | antonyms: acidimetry | noun
