注意事项:  The word "montreals" is grammatically correct but rarely used in practical contexts.  It sounds unnatural.  It would be best to rephrase any sentence using it to refer to "Montreal" singularly and specify the aspect being discussed (e.g., "different neighborhoods of Montreal," "various cultural events in Montreal").
