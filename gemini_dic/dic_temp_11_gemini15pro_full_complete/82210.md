Etymology: From French *grotesque* (meaning "picturesque," "fantastic," related to Italian *grottesca* "cave paintings"), ultimately from Latin *crypta* "vault, cavern."  The shift in meaning from "picturesque" to "bizarre" and "distorted" occurred over time, likely influenced by the strange and fanciful figures found in ancient Roman grottoes and catacombs.
