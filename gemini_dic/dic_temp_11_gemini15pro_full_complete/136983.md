词性:adjective

词源:
"nonspiniest" is a combination of "non-" (a prefix meaning "not") and "spiniest" (the superlative form of "spiny").  "Spiny" itself comes from "spine," which originally refers to the backbone. Metaphorically, "spine" refers to courage or resoluteness. Therefore, "nonspiniest" denotes the complete lack of these qualities.
