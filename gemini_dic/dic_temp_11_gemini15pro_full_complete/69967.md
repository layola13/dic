ETYMOLOGY->
From festive + -ness + -es (plural suffix).  "Festive" comes from the Old French "festiv" and ultimately the Latin "festivus," meaning "festal, joyous," related to "festum" meaning "festival." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns indicating a state or quality. The suffix "-es" creates the plural form.
