PHRASE->
(Since "fireplaced" is an adjective, it doesn't form standard phrases like verbs or nouns.  It primarily describes a feature of a room or building.)  It's more common to encounter phrases related to fireplaces themselves, such as "by the fireplace," "in front of the fireplace," "a roaring fireplace," etc.
