heteromorphism:/ˌhɛtərəˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n.|异形性，多态性|The existence of two or more distinct forms within a species is known as heteromorphism.  在一个物种内存在两种或两种以上不同形态的现象被称为异形性。|Different generations of the same plant species can exhibit heteromorphism, with variations in leaf shape and size. 同一种植物的不同世代可以表现出异形性，叶子的形状和大小会有所不同。|近义词：polymorphism, variation, diversity|反义词：monomorphism, uniformity|词性: noun
Etymology: From Greek *héteros* (different) + *morphḗ* (form) + *-ismos* (forming nouns of action or condition).
