airspeeds:/ˈɛərˌspiːdz/| n. |空速（复数）|The speed of an aircraft relative to the air through which it is moving.  It is different from ground speed, which takes into account wind effects.|The pilot monitored the airspeeds carefully during the turbulent flight.  飞行员在湍流飞行中仔细监测空速。|Synonyms: velocity (in air), rate of flight|Antonyms: N/A (Speed is a scalar quantity; its opposite would be a negative speed, which isn't directly applicable to airspeeds.)|noun
