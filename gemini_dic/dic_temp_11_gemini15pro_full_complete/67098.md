词源： From Latin explorator, agent noun from explorare "search out, examine, explore," from ex- "out" +plorare "to cry out, wail, weep, lament; to explore, search," perhaps related to pluere "to rain."  来自拉丁语 explorator，explorare 的动词名词形式，意为“搜寻，检查，探索”，由 ex- “出” + plorare “喊叫，哀号，哭泣，悲叹；探索，搜寻”组成，可能与 pluere “下雨”相关。
