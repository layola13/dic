ooklace: /ˈʊkˌleɪs/ | n. | 鞋带 | A string or cord used to lace and fasten shoes. | She bent down to tie her ooklace. 她弯腰系鞋带。| 近义词: shoelace | 反义词: (无直接反义词) | 词性: 名词

词源:  A blend of "hook" and "lace," likely referring to the hooks sometimes used for fastening shoes before modern eyelets and laces became common.  While "ooklace" is not a standard English word, its construction suggests this likely origin, playing off the more common "shoelace."
