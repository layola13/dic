Etymology:
"over-" (Old English *ofer-, from Proto-Germanic *uberi "over, above, beyond") + "corrupt" (from Latin corruptus, past participle of corrumpere "to destroy, ruin, spoil, bribe," from com- "together" + rumpere "to break").  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning of "corrupting," indicating an excessive or extreme degree of corruption.
