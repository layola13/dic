noninterchangeablenesses:/ˌnɒnɪntətʃeɪndʒəˈbɪlɪtɪz/ | /ˌnɑːnɪntərˌtʃeɪndʒəˈbɪlɪtɪz/ | n. | 不可互换性 | The state or quality of not being interchangeable; the inability to be exchanged or substituted for one another. |  The noninterchangeablenesses of the parts in this machine make repairs difficult.  这台机器零件的不可互换性使得维修很困难。|  non-substitutability, uniqueness, singularity | interchangeability, substitutability | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + interchangeable + -ness.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Interchangeable" comes from "inter-" (between) + "change" (to make or become different) + "-able" (capable of). "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
