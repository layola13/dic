ETYMOLOGY->
"fast track" is a compound word combining "fast" and "track." "Fast" in this context means rapid or quick, and "track" refers to a course or path.  The term originated in American English in the mid-20th century, likely related to horse racing and later adopted in other contexts to mean an accelerated process.
