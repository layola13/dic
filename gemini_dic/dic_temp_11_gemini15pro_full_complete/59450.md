词源:  Old English *ēarewearm, from ēare "ear" + wearm "warm," from Proto-Germanic *warmaz (source also of Old Saxon warm, Old Frisian werm, Old Norse varmr, Dutch warm, Old High German warm, German warm, Gothic warmjan "to warm").  The notion is of the wax being soft and at body temperature. Later altered by influence of wax (n.).
