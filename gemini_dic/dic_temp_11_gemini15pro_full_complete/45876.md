ETYMOLOGY->
From cute + -ly.  "Cute" originated in the 18th century as a shortened form of "acute," meaning sharp or clever.  Over time, its meaning shifted to refer to something attractive or pretty, especially in a delicate or dainty way.  The suffix "-ly" is a common adverbial ending, transforming adjectives into adverbs.
