nonextensive:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstensɪv/
adj.|非广延的|Not extensive; not reaching far; limited in range or scope.  Specifically used in physics and thermodynamics to describe systems where the entropy is not an extensive quantity (i.e., it does not scale linearly with the system size).|This research focuses on nonextensive thermodynamics and its applications.|近义词:non-extensive, limited, restricted, confined|反义词:extensive, broad, wide-ranging|词性:形容词
词源: Prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "extensive" (from Latin "extendere" - to stretch out).
