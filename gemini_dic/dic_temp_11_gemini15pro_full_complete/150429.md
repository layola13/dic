panspermy:/ˈpænspɜːrmi/| n. |泛种论；宇宙胚种论| The hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe,distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, and comets, colliding with planets and potentially "seeding" them with life.  This theory suggests that life on Earth mayhave originated from elsewhere in the cosmos.  It does not necessarily propose that all life originated from a single source, but rather that life can spread between celestial bodies. | Example: The panspermia hypothesis proposes that life on Earth may have extraterrestrial origins.  泛种论假设地球上的生命可能起源于地球之外。  The study of extremophiles has added credence to the panspermiatheory, as these organisms demonstrate remarkable resilience to harsh environmental conditions. 极端微生物的研究为泛种论增添了可信度，因为这些生物对恶劣环境条件表现出非凡的适应力。|近义词：exogenesis (外成说)|反义词：autogenesis (自生说)|名词Present Continuous):取得了什么成就？? = 我到达之前发生了什么事？= 他们一直在讨论什么？明天这个时候你会在做什么？变化？knew what to do, I would do it. = 如果我知道该做什么，我就会去做。the problem? = 正在采取什么措施来解决这个问题？'t tell me what she wanted. = 她没有告诉我她想要什么。what = 无论如何πέρμα), meaning "seed."
