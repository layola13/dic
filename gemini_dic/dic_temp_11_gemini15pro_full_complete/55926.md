PHRASE->
(While “dix” is not commonly used in English phrases as it's French for "ten," here are some phrases using the English equivalent "ten"):
ten times out of ten = 十有八九；几乎总是
ten to one = 很有可能；十之八九
top ten = 前十名
tenfold = 十倍的；十重的
catch twenty-two =  左右为难的局面; 进退两难的困境 (uses "twenty" which is two times ten)


注意事项:

“dix”本身是法语单词，在英语中并不常用。英语中使用“ten”。  这个解析基于“dix”作为数字十的含义进行解释。  如果在特定语境下有其他含义，需要根据具体情况进行分析。
