gadolinium:/ˌɡæd(ə)ˈlɪniəm/| n.|钆|A silvery-white metallic chemical element of the lanthanide series of the periodic table. It is used in nuclear reactors, lasers, and MRI scans.|Gadolinium contrast is used in MRI scans to enhance the visibility of internal organs.|近义词: (As a contrast agent) Other lanthanides like dysprosium, holmium|反义词: N/A|词性:noun

Etymology: Named after the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin (1760–1852), who discovered the first rare earth element, yttrium. The name gadolinite was given to a mineral containing yttrium, and the element gadolinium was later isolated from this mineral.
