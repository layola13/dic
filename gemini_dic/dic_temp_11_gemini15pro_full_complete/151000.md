##paranaphthalene: 详细解析ˈliːn/` | n. | 并萘；对萘 |A crystalline hydrocarbon isomer of naphthalene.  |  Paranaphthalene is less common than naphthalene.  | 近义词：naphthalene (萘)| 反义词：无直接反义词"Para-" is a prefix derived from Greek  παρά (pará), meaning "beside" or "alongside," indicating a specific isomeric arrangement. "Naphthalene," the root word, itself originates from  "naphthalin,"coined from the word "naphtha" (a flammable liquid hydrocarbon)  plus the "-ene" suffix indicating an alkene hydrocarbon.  The term reflects its chemical relationship to naphthalene, specifically its isomeric structure where the additionalgroups are positioned in the para position relative to each other on the naphthalene ring system.10}H_8$) but a different arrangement of atoms. This structural difference impacts physical and chemical properties. Unlike the more common naphthalene, paranaphthalene isn't as widely studied or applied, limiting its everyday usage. It might appear in specialized chemical literature, research papers on hydrocarbon isomers, or in discussions ofchemical synthesis and analysis where isomer differentiation is crucial.the presence of paranaphthalene in the sample.  光谱分析证实样品中存在并萘。英语时态的例句，每个时态提供两个例句，并包含英文和中文翻译。注意，这些例句并非在真实的化学场景中，而是为了展现时态的应用。下熔化。aphthalene in new materials. 他们正在研究并萘在新材料中的应用。各种并萘衍生物。The chemists were testing the reactivity of paranaphthalene when the power failed. 化学家们正在测试并萘的反应性时，电源突然坏了。**过去完成时 (Past Perfect):**(Past Perfect Continuous):**一直在致力于并萘的合成。的潜在应用。将在会议上介绍他们关于并萘的研究。of the year. 到年底，他们将已经发表了几篇关于并萘的论文。。具体的化学上下文才能充分理解。  以上例句旨在展示英语不同时态的用法，而非真实的化学实验描述。
