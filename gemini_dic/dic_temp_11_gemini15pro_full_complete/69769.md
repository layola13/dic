fermac:/ˈfɜːrmæk/ | n. | Fermat's principle (费马原理) | Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  It is a cornerstone of optics and helps explain phenomena like refraction and reflection. | Light follows Fermat's principle to travel from point A to point B. 光线遵循费马原理从A点传播到B点。|  Principle of least action, Snell's Law | N/A | noun
