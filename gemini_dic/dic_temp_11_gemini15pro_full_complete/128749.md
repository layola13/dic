注意事项:

This word has a deeply painful and complex history rooted in slavery and white supremacy.  Its use is categorically unacceptable and causes significant harm. While it's important to understand its historical context and the impact it has had, using it in any context reinforces its power to wound and degrade.  Learning about the history of racial slurs and the ongoing fight for racial equality is crucial, but using these slurs, even in an educational setting, is inappropriate and harmful.
