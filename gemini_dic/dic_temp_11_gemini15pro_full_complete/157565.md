##pitchblende 的详细解析blɛnd/ | n. | 沥青铀矿 |  一种黑色或褐黑色的铀矿物，含有大量的铀和镭等放射性元素。因其外观类似沥青而得名。 |  Pitchblendeis a radioactive mineral that contains a high percentage of uranium.  沥青铀矿是一种含有高比例铀的放射性矿物。 | 近义词：uranium ore (铀矿) | 反义词：无 |  名词mineral, resembling pitch or asphalt. "Blende" is derived from the German word "blenden," meaning "to dazzle" or "to deceive."  This refers to the fact that pitchblende's appearance belies its radioactivenature;  its valuable contents are not immediately obvious.  The word ultimately combines the visual description of the mineral with a hint at the hidden, surprising properties within.in its historical significance in the discovery of radioactivity and the isolation of radium and other radioactive elements. The mineral's name reflects its early perception, before its radioactive properties were understood.  Scientists and geologists use the term precisely to refer to this specific uranium ore.in pitchblende revolutionized physics.  在沥青铀矿中发现镭彻底改变了物理学。is highly radioactive due to its high uranium content. This radioactivity was crucial in the early research of radioactivity and nuclear physics.  Handling pitchblende requires stringent safety precautions.onium and radium, earning them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.  Pitchblende, therefore, holds a significant place in the history of science.and other applications.  The careful and controlled processing of pitchblende is a crucial element in the nuclear fuel cycle.contexts.
