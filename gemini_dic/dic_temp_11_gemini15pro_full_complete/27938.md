词源：From the Old North French *canter (to sing, chant, beg), from Latin cantare (to sing).  The meaning shifted to "jargon" and "hypocritical talk" because beggars and thieves often used special language.  The meaning "sloping" is related to the nautical term "cant," referring to the tilting of a ship.
