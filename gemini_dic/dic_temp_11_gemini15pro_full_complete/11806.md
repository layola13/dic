Etymology:
From Middle English *errant*, from Old French *errant* (“wandering, errant”), present participle of *errer* (“to err, wander”), from Latin *errō* (“I wander, err, go astray”), from Proto-Italic *ersō*, from Proto-Indo-European *h₁ers-*.  The sense development in English appears to be from "wandering rogue" to "infamous" to "downright, thoroughgoing (in a bad sense)".
