bytes:/baɪts/| n.|字节|A byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long, used to represent a character such as a letter, number, or symbol.  A byte is the basic building block of digital information.|The file is 2.5 megabytes.|Synonyms: character, unit (of data)|Antonyms: N/A|noun

The program will have allocated sufficient bytes by the time it starts. = 到程序启动时，它将分配足够的字节。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the system will have been processing bytes of data for a month. = 到下周，系统将已经处理数据字节一个月了。
The program will have been allocating bytes of memory continuously for several hours by then. = 到那时，程序将已经连续分配内存字节几个小时了。



虚拟语气:
If the file contained fewer bytes, it would load faster. = 如果文件包含的字节更少，它会加载得更快。
I wish the program allocated more bytes for this task. = 我希望程序为这项任务分配更多字节。



被动语态:
Megabytes of data are processed every second. = 每秒处理兆字节的数据。
The bytes were allocated by the operating system. = 字节是由操作系统分配的。



疑问句:
How many bytes are in a kilobyte? = 一个千字节有多少字节？
What are these bytes used for? = 这些字节用于什么？



否定句:
The file doesn't contain many bytes. = 该文件不包含很多字节。
The program didn't allocate enough bytes. = 程序没有分配足够的字节。



PHRASE->
data in bytes = 以字节为单位的数据
allocate bytes = 分配字节
process bytes = 处理字节
store bytes = 存储字节
transfer bytes = 传输字节
