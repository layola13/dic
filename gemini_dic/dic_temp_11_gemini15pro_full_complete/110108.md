Etymology: From the verb "to lick," originally meaning "to strike or beat," from Old English *liccian, related to Old Norse sleikja "to lick, lap," and Old High German leichōn "to lick."  The sense of "defeat" likely arose from the image of being beaten so severely as to need licking one's wounds.

注意事项:
"lickings" in the sense of "a beating" or "scolding" is informal and can be considered somewhat old-fashioned. It's more common in certain dialects, particularly in American English. While "lick" itself can refer to defeating someone in a competition ("He licked me at chess"), "lickings" specifically emphasizes a decisive and often humiliating defeat or a harsh reprimand.  Be mindful of the context and audience when using this word.
