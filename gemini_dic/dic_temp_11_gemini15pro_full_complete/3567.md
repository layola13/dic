agapai's:/ˌɑːɡəˈpaɪz/ | n. | 阿加佩的爱（复数形式）| Agapai's is the possessive form of agapai, likely a transliteration of the Greek word "ἀγάπη" (agapē) meaning love, typically referring to a selfless, unconditional love. It implies possession related to this kind of love.  Since "agapē" is a concept rather than a concrete noun, its possessive form is unusual and primarily seen in specific contexts like theological or philosophical discussions, or potentially as a stylized name. |  Agapai's teachings emphasized forgiveness.  阿加佩的教导强调宽恕。|  The depth of Agapai's compassion was evident.  阿加佩的同情之深显而易见。 | Near Synonyms:  agape's, love's (in a similar philosophical/theological context), charitable, selfless | Antonyms: hate's, selfish | noun
