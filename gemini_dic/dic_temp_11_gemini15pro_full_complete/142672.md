词源：From Russian острог (ostrog), from Proto-Slavic *ostrogъ, from *ostьriti (“to sharpen”). Ultimately from the same Proto-Indo-European root (*ster-) as English stark. Originally referred to a sharpened stake or palisade, later to a fortification made of such stakes, and finally to any fortified settlement.
