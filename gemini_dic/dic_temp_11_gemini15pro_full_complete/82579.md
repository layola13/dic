Etymology:
From "guarded" + "-ly". "Guarded" comes from the verb "guard," which originated from the Old French word "garder" (to protect, keep, watch), ultimately derived from the Frankish "*wardōn," related to the Old High German "wartōn" (to watch). The suffix "-ly" forms adverbs from adjectives.
