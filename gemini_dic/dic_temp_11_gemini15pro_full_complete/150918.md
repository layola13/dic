##parallelize:/ˈpærəˌlaɪz/ | vt. |并行化 | 使并行 | To divide a task into multiple subtasksthat can be executed concurrently. This often involves using multiple processors or threads to speed up the process.  |  We can parallelize the image processing to reducethe overall processing time. 我们能并行化图像处理来减少总的处理时间。 |  concurrent, simultaneous | sequential, serial:**n), meaning "one another."  Thus, "parallel" originally referred to lines that are beside each other and maintain a consistent distance. The "-ize" suffix is a common verb-forming suffix indicating to make something into a certain stateor to cause something to become a certain way.  Therefore, "parallelize" literally means "to make something parallel" or "to make something run alongside each other."process of breaking down a large task or computation into smaller, independent subtasks that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. This strategy significantly improves efficiency, especially for computationally intensive tasks.query to improve performance." (我们需要并行化数据库查询以提高性能。) This implies that a single database query is computationally expensive, and by dividing it into smaller parts and executing those parts simultaneously across different processors or threads to run faster.training process allows for quicker model development." (并行化机器学习模型训练过程可以加快模型开发。) Here the emphasis is on reducing the time needed to train a complex machine learning model using multiple cores or machines working on different aspects of the training process in parallel.The supercomputer utilizes advanced techniques to parallelize simulations of complex physical phenomena." (超级计算机利用先进的技术来并行化复杂物理现象的模拟。)  This showcases the use of parallelization in highly demanding computational applications where the sheer magnitude of calculations necessitates splitting them into many parallel processes.(比喻用法):** While less common, "parallelize" can be used figuratively:  "The project manager tried to parallelize the different teams' work to ensure a timely completion." (项目经理试图使不同团队的工作并行化以确保按时完成。) This illustrates a task management approach mimickingparallel processing, although the process isn't literally performed computationally.部分例句使用虚拟语气或被动语态来展现更丰富的语言表达方式。tasks to speed up the process.  团队正在并行化数据分析任务以加快进程。the computations last year, and the results are now being analyzed.  我们在去年并行化了计算，结果现在正在分析中。:** We will parallelize this algorithm to handle larger datasets. 我们将并行化此算法以处理更大的数据集。task has been parallelized for better performance. 该任务已被并行化以提高性能。以上例句旨在尽力涵盖多种时态，展现其表达的可能性。
