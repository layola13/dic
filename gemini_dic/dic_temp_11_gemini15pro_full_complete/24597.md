ETYMOLOGY->
From the Irish word *bróg* meaning "shoe," plus the English suffix "-eries" indicating a collection or assortment, though generally used in the singular ("broguery") to refer to the craft of making brogues or to a place where they are made.  The modern usage as a plural for the shoes themselves is less common but still encountered.
