From "barn" + "storm."  Originally referred to theatrical performances held in barns. Later, with the advent of aviation, it came to mean traveling by plane to perform or campaign in rural areas.  The image evoked is one of taking something exciting and unexpected to a place where it wouldn't normally be found, like a storm in a barn.
