The French term further traces its roots to the Old French word "pelote," a diminutive form of "pele," meaning "ball." The military use of the word arose from the tightly packed formations of soldiers,resembling a ball of people.  Over time, “platoon” transitioned from signifying a small group to a specific military unit.  The verb "platooned" is thus a direct derivation reflecting the active process of forming or organizing into platoons.the act of forming soldiers or other groups into platoons—small tactical units—or arranging something in the manner of a platoon. It implies a structured and organized arrangement, often in a linear or column formation.  While mostly used in a military context, the word can metaphorically describe any organized grouping of items or peoplemoving in a similar manner, possibly suggesting cohesiveness, synchronized movement, or even a sense of uniformity.排成队穿过城市街道。早上整齐地排成队在池塘里。玩老鹰捉小鸡游戏。多次飞过我的花园。群已经成V字形编队飞行数小时了。the stadium. 行进乐队完美地排队穿过体育场。排队穿过狭窄的街道。The runners had platooned before their individual sprints began.  跑步者们在他们个人短跑开始前已经排好了队。。接受检查。be platooning on the highway in ten minutes.  车辆在十分钟后将排成一队行驶在高速公路上。大陆。分配资源。The additional examples illustrate its broader application beyond solely military contexts.
