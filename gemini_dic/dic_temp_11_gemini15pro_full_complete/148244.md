词源:
From over- + skeptical + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Skeptical" comes from the Greek "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring" or "thoughtful," referring to a philosophical school of thought. The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "skeptical" into the noun "skepticalness."  Adding "over-" intensifies the meaning to imply an excessive degree of skepticism.
