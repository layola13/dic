apogaic:/ˌæpəˈdʒiːɪk/| adj.|远地点的；最高点的|Relating to the apogee, the point in an orbit farthest from the body being orbited.|The spacecraft's apogaic maneuver positioned it perfectly for observation.|近义词：apogean|反义词:perigaic|词性:形容词
Etymology: From Greek *apogaios* "from the earth," from *apo* "from, away from" + *gaia* or *ge* "earth."  Originally referred to the farthest point in the orbit of the moon from the earth.  The more general sense, referring to any orbit, uses the -ic suffix to form an adjective.
