词源:
From "brood" (Old English "brōd," meaning "a sitting of eggs," later expanding to offspring and then to the act of sitting on eggs) + "over" (Old English "ofer," indicating position above or across). The combined meaning developed to represent the image of a bird sitting on eggs, extended metaphorically to someone dwelling persistently on a thought or feeling.
