chlorofluorocarbons:/ˌklɔːrəʊˈflʊərəʊˌkɑːrbənz/ /ˌklɔːroʊˈflʊəroʊˌkɑːrbənz/| n. |氯氟烃|Man-made chemical compounds containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon, used primarily as refrigerants and propellants. They are harmful to the ozone layer.| Chlorofluorocarbons were widely used in refrigerators before their harmful effects were discovered. 氯氟烃在发现其有害影响之前被广泛用于冰箱。| Synonyms: CFCs, freons | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as these are specific chemical compounds. One might consider "ozone-friendly refrigerants" as a functional opposite.) | noun
