inconformity:/ˌɪnkənˈfɔːrməti/ | n. |不整合，不一致，不符合|A break in the continuity of a rock sequence indicating interruption of sedimentation, typically for a prolonged period, accompanied by erosion or non-deposition; or a surface of erosion or non-deposition separating younger strata from older rocks that are not in stratigraphic continuity.|The unconformity between the two rock layers suggests a period of uplift and erosion.|近义词：discordance, discontinuity, gap|反义词：conformity|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + conformity.  Ultimately from Latin *conformis* (similar in form) from *com-* (with, together) + *formis* (form, shape).
