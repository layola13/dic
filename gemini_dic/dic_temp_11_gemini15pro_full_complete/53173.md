词源:  From "dippy" + "-ness."  "Dippy" originated in the early 20th century, likely as a slang term suggesting being slightly crazy or eccentric, possibly influenced by the image of someone dipping their head or acting in a jerky, unsteady manner.  The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns denoting a state or quality.
