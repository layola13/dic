azotometer:/ˌeɪzoʊˈtɒmɪtər/ | n. | 氮素计，氮量计 | An instrument used to measure the amount of nitrogen in a substance, especially in organic compounds. | The scientist used an azotometer to determine the nitrogen content of the soil sample. 科学家用氮素计测定土壤样品中的氮含量。 |  nitrogen meter, nitrometer |  None | noun
Etymology->
From French *azote* (nitrogen) + *-mètre* (-meter).  *Azote* itself comes from Ancient Greek *ἄζωτος (ázōtos)* meaning "lifeless," because nitrogen doesn't support life on its own.
