Thisis in contrast to *orthokeratotic* where cells in the stratum corneum are anucleate (lacking a nucleus).  Parakeratosis is often associated with various skin conditions and diseases, reflecting an impaired or incomplete process ofkeratinization (the formation of keratin, a tough protein that makes skin protective).  The retention of nuclei can sometimes be seen as a histological finding under a microscope. The degree of parakeratosis can vary depending on the cause and severity ofthe underlying condition.状病变中常观察到角化过度症。)* orthokeratotic (正角化的): This describes the normal condition where the stratum corneum lacks nuclei.." In this context, it signifies a deviation from the normal keratinization process.akeratotic" literally means "abnormally keratinized" or "having an irregular keratinization process."
