Since "cdor" isn't a recognized English word, I cannot provide etymology or usage examples.  If it's a misspelling, perhaps you meant "cedar," "coder,"  "cador," or another similar word.  Please clarify so I can provide accurate information.


If you can give me more context (like where you encountered this word), I might be able to give you a more specific answer.  For example, is it a technical term used in a specific field? Is it a name?  Knowing the context will help me determine the meaning and provide relevant information.


Since I can't provide information about "cdor," I'll use "what" as an example to demonstrate the requested formats for grammar and phrases, as "what" is frequently used in questions:


what: /wɑːt/ /hwɑːt/ | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something; used to show surprise or disbelief | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ |  which, how | N/A | pronoun
