词源:  This phrase combines "hot" (referring to temperature, and by extension, feeling agitated or excited) with "bothered" (meaning troubled or annoyed).  The combination intensifies the sense of being upset or flustered. It gained popularity in the early 20th century, particularly in American English.  The sexual connotation developed later.
