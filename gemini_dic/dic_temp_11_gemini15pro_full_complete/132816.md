noneclipsing:/ˌnɒnɪˈklɪpsɪŋ/| adj.|非食的，不发生掩食的|Describing a binary star system where one star does not pass in front of the other from the perspective of Earth, thus not causing an eclipse.|The astronomers observed a noneclipsing binary star system. 天文学家观测到一个非食双星系统。|The two stars are in a noneclipsing orbit. 这两颗恒星在一个非食轨道上。|Near synonyms: detached, separate|Antonym: eclipsing|Adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
non- + eclipsing.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Eclipsing" comes from the verb "eclipse," which ultimately derives from the Greek "ekleipsis" meaning "a failing, forsaking, or abandoning."
