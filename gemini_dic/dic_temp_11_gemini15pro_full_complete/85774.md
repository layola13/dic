"hayey" is not a recognized English word. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a slang term, a newly coined word, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word, what was being discussed), I might be able to offer a better explanation.

Since I can't analyze "hayey," I'll demonstrate the requested format using the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
