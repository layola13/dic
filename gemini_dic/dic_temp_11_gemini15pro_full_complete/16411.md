Etymology:
From Middle French *bardé, past participle of barder (“to barde”), from Old French barder, from Old High German *bard, *bart (“beard, horse armor”), from Proto-Germanic *bardō (“axe, battle-axe”). Cognate with Old English beard (“beard”).  The sense development likely proceeded from the resemblance of horse armor to a beard protecting the horse's face and neck.
