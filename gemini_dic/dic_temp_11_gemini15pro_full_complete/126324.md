Etymology: From Late Latin *myopia, from Ancient Greek μυωπία (muōpía, “nearsightedness”), from μύωψ (múōps, “nearsighted person”), from μύειν (múein, “to shut, close”) + ὤψ (ṓps, “eye, face”).  The plural form "myopias" is less common than "myopia" when referring to the condition in general.  However, "myopias" can be used when discussing different types or degrees of myopia.
