half-conservatively:/ˌhæf kənˈsɜːrvətɪvli/ | adv. | 半保留地 |  Describes a process, particularly DNA replication, where one strand of the original molecule is conserved in each of the two new molecules. | DNA replicates half-conservatively, meaning each new DNA molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.  DNA进行半保留复制，这意味着每个新的DNA分子由一条原始链和一条新合成的链组成。| Near Synonyms: semi-conservatively | Antonyms: (No direct antonym, but could contrast with dispersive or conservative replication) | 词性: 副词
