词源:
Both "macaroon" and "macaron" ultimately derive from the Italian word *maccherone*, meaning "paste" or "dough." This word itself comes from the verb *ammaccare*, meaning "to crush" or "to beat," referring to the process of making the dough.  Over time, the word evolved differently in English and French, leading to the two distinct modern forms with slight variations in meaning and pronunciation.  The coconut macaroon developed as a variation of the almond-based cookie, particularly in areas where almonds were less readily available.
