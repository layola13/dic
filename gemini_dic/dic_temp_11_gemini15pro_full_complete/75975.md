词源: "Funned" is the past tense form of the verb "fun," which itself is derived from the noun "fun." The noun "fun" originated in the early 18th century, likely as a shortened form of the word "function" in the sense of a social gathering or festive occasion.  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass enjoyment and amusement.  The use of "fun" as a verb is relatively recent, becoming more common in the late 20th century.
