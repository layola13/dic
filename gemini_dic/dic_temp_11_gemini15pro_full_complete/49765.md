ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *demon*, from Old French *demon*, from Latin *daemon*, from Ancient Greek *δαίμων* (*daímōn*, “deity, divine power; lesser god; guiding spirit, tutelary deity; genius, spirit”).  The original Greek word *δαίμων* could refer to a benevolent or malevolent spirit, but the later Latin and subsequent usages primarily focus on the malevolent sense.
