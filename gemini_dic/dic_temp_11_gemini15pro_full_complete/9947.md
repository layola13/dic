aphanite:/ˈæfənaɪt/| n. |细晶岩，隐晶岩|A dense, fine-grained igneous rock whose individual mineral crystals are too small to be seen without magnification.|The geologist identified the sample as an aphanite due to its smooth texture and the inability to distinguish individual crystals with the naked eye.|近义词:fine-grained rock, microcrystalline rock|反义词:phanerite, coarse-grained rock|词性:noun

Etymology: From Greek *aphanēs* "unseen, invisible," from *a-* "not" + *phainein* "to show, to appear."
