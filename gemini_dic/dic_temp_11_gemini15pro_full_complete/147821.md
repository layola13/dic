ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + publicize. "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much." "Publicize" comes from "public" meaning "of or relating to the people as a whole" and "-ize" which is a suffix forming verbs meaning "to make or cause to be." Thus, "overpublicize" means to publicize something excessively.
