isor: /ˈaɪsɔːr/ (This pronunciation is a best guess based on typical English phonetics, as "isor" isn't a recognized English word.) | n. |  异构体 (This translation is based on the likely intended meaning, relating to isomers) |  "Isor" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a shortened or misspelled form of "isomer," which refers to molecules with the same chemical formula but different structural arrangements. |  (No example sentence possible with "isor" as it's not a real word.  Example using "isomer":) Butane and isobutane are isomers. 丁烷和异丁烷是异构体。 | 近义词: isomer, (If referring to a specific type of isomer:) enantiomer, diastereomer | 反义词:  N/A (Isomers are a descriptive category, not a concept with an opposite) | 词性: Noun (Likely intended)

PHRASE-> (Since "isor" isn't a real word, these use "isomer"):
structural isomer 结构异构体
stereo isomer 立体异构体
cis-trans isomers 顺反异构体
optical isomer 光学异构体
geometric isomer 几何异构体


注意事项:  "isor" isn't a valid English word.  This entire analysis is based on the assumption that "isomer" was intended.  If a different meaning was intended, the analysis would be completely different.
