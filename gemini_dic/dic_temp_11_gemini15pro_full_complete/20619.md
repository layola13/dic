词源： blackjack (n.) "short, leather-covered club," 1820, American English, from black + jack (n.1). Sense of "the card game twenty-one" is first recorded 1891, perhaps from the notion of a winning hand containing the jack of spades or clubs. The verb meaning "to coerce" is from 1947, originally of labor racketeers demanding payoffs; perhaps from an image of the weapon, or from the sense of "winning at blackjack."
