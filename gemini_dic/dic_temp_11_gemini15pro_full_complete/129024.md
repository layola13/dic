nistoran: /nɪˈstɔːrən/
noun
尼斯特拉教徒
a follower of Nistor, a Romanian religious figure who led a schismatic movement in the early 20th century.
Nistor was a Romanian Orthodox priest who broke away from the church and formed his own sect, which emphasized a literal interpretation of the Bible and rejected many traditional Orthodox practices.  Nistoranism is largely considered a heterodox movement.
There are few remaining Nistorans today, primarily located in rural Romania.  Their beliefs and practices are not widely known or documented.
