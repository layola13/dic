词源:  "inter-" (between) + "pattern" (a repeated decorative design) + "-ing" (present participle ending) + "-s" (plural suffix).  The word is formed by combining the prefix "inter-" with the noun "pattern" to create the verb "interpattern," meaning to form patterns between or among things. The "-ing" suffix creates the present participle, which functions as a noun in this case, and the "-s" indicates the plural form.
