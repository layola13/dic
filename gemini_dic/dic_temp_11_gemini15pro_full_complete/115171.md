PHRASE->

(Phrases are more accurately represented in Latin rather than English constructions)

Scriptum manibus = Written by hand 亲笔书写

Etymology: From Latin "manus" (hand).  The "-ibus" ending indicates the dative/ablative plural.  It's an inflectional ending, meaning it changes the function of the word in a sentence rather than its core meaning.


注意事项:

"Manibus" is a fixed form, a dative/ablative plural noun.  It doesn't have different tenses or conjugations like English verbs.  It is always used in its plural form. Its usage is primarily confined to Latin phrases and inscriptions.  Attempting to force it into standard English grammatical structures is inappropriate.
