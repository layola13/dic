词源： "heavy metal" as a musical term originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, popularized by bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple.  The term's origins are debated, but it likely comes from counter-culture slang and literature, referring to the music's loud, powerful, and often aggressive sound, likened to the weight and intensity of heavy metals.
