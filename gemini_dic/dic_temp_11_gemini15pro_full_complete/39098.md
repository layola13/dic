Etymology: From "confront" + "-al". "Confront" comes from the Old French "confronter," meaning "to compare," from the Latin "confrontare," meaning "to border upon, compare," from "com-" (together) + "frons" (forehead, front). The suffix "-al" forms adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."
