注意事项:

This word is extremely offensive and should never be used.  Its etymology can be traced back to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots related to the concept of a "wedge" or "vulva," but its modern usage is purely as a derogatory and misogynistic slur.  Using this word perpetuates harm and contributes to a hostile environment.  Avoid using it entirely.
