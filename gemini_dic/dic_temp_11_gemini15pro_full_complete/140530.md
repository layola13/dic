PHRASE->
(Since "-olent" is a suffix, it doesn't form phrases in the same way words do.  It primarily combines with other word parts to create adjectives.)  Therefore, I'll provide examples of words using this suffix in phrases:

redolent of: The air was redolent of the sea. 空气中弥漫着大海的气息。
redolent with: The room was redolent with the smell of baking bread. 房间里充满了烤面包的香味。
violent towards: He was violent towards his neighbors. 他对邻居很暴力。
benevolent towards: She was benevolent towards the poor. 她对穷人很仁慈。
malevolent towards: He felt malevolent towards his rivals. 他对他的对手心怀恶意。


注意事项:

"-olent"本身不是一个独立的单词，而是一个后缀。 它的意思是“充满...的；有...气味的”。

它通常与其他词根结合使用，例如redolent（芬芳的）、violent（暴力的）和benevolent（仁慈的）。
