bitwise:/ˈbɪtwaɪz/| adj.|按位，逐位|Relating to or performed on the individual bits of a binary numeral.  It refers to operations that treat each bit in a data unit (like a byte) individually, rather than considering the whole unit as a single number.|例句：Bitwise operations are fundamental in computer programming. 按位运算是计算机编程的基础。|近义词：bit-by-bit|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps 'holistic' in a conceptual sense) |词性: Adjective
