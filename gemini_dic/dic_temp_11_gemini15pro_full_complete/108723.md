词源: From Middle English *lene, from Old English *hlæne (“lean, meager, thin”), from Proto-Germanic *hlainaz (“leaning, sloping, oblique”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱley- (“to lean, incline”).  Cognate with Dutch leen (“fief”), German Lehen (“fief”).  The semantic development is from “inclined, sloping” to “thin, meager” (perhaps with the image of someone stooping from hunger).
