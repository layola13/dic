ETYMOLOGY->
"bellycheer" is a relatively new and informal word. It is a compound word formed from "belly" and "cheer".  "Belly" refers to the abdomen, and "cheer" refers to a shout of encouragement or applause.  Therefore, "bellycheer" literally means a cheer from the belly, referring to the feeling of a baby's movements in the womb.  It does not have a complex etymological history like older, more established words.
