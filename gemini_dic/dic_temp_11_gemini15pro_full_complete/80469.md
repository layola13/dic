gonoblastid:/ˌɡɒnəˈblæstɪd/ | n. |生殖芽|A cell in a cnidarian that develops into a gamete (sex cell).|The gonoblastids of the hydra are located in the body wall.|近义词:germ cell, reproductive cell|反义词:somatic cell|词性:noun

Etymology:
From gono- + -blast + -id.  Gono- comes from Greek *gonḗ* meaning "seed, generation, offspring." -blast comes from Greek *blastós* meaning "bud, sprout."  -id is a suffix forming nouns, often from Greek *eîdos* meaning "form, shape."
