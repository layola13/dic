geotropic:/ˌdʒiːəˈtrɒpɪk/ /ˌdʒiːoʊˈtrɑːpɪk/| adj.|向地性的；地向性的|Influenced by gravity, as the roots or stems of plants.|例句：The geotropic growth of roots ensures they grow downwards into the soil. 根的向地性生长确保它们向下生长到土壤中。

例句：The plant's stem exhibited negative geotropism, growing upwards against the force of gravity.  这种植物的茎表现出负向地性，逆着重力向上生长。|近义词：gravitropic|反义词：apogeotropic|词性:形容词
