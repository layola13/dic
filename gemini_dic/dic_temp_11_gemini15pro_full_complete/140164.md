PHRASE->
(While "offenseful" is less common than "offensive," it's difficult to create natural-sounding phrases using it.  It's generally used on its own as a predicate adjective.)  Therefore, I will provide phrases using the more common synonym "offensive":

offensive language = 冒犯性的语言
offensive remark = 冒犯性的言论
deeply offensive = 非常冒犯
cause offense = 造成冒犯
find something offensive = 觉得某事冒犯


注意事项:  "Offenseful" is a less common variant of "offensive."  "Offensive" is the preferred and more widely accepted term.
