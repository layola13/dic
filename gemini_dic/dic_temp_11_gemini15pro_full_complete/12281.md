词源: From Middle French *ascetique*, from Late Latin *asceticus*, from Greek *askētikós* (“practiced in athletic exercises; athletic”), from *askētēs* (“athlete, hermit”), from *askēsis* (“exercise, training”).  The sense shifted from "athletic training" to "spiritual discipline" because early Christians saw a parallel between physical and spiritual discipline.
