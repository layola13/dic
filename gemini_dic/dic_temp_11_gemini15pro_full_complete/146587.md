词源:  "over" (excessive) + "greasiness" (the state of being greasy) + "es" (plural suffix, though less common for this type of word and arguably unnecessary/awkward)  "greasiness" comes from "greasy" which ultimately derives from Old English "græs" (grass, herb).  The association likely developed from the oily/waxy nature of certain plants.
