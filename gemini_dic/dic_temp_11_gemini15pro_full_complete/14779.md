awney: /ˈɔːni/ | adj. | 敬畏的，令人惊叹的 | Inspiring awe; impressive. |  The awney power of the ocean left me speechless. 浩瀚的海洋力量让我 speechless。 | 近义词：awesome, majestic, grand, awe-inspiring, breathtaking | 反义词： unimpressive, ordinary, mundane | 词性: 形容词


词源:  Likely a variant or misspelling of "awny," an archaic term meaning "bearded," derived from "awn," referring to the beard of barley or other grains.  Over time, the association with the visual grandeur of fields of grain might have contributed to a shift in meaning towards "awe-inspiring." It's also possible that it's a direct derivation from "awe" with a suffix added, though less documented.
