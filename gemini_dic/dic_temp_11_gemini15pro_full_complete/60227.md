注意事项:
As mentioned throughout, the word "efforting" is non-standard and should be used with caution.  "Trying," "striving," or "making an effort" are generally preferred in formal contexts.  Its use might be accepted in some informal business settings, but even then, alternatives are usually better.  Its etymology is simply derived from the noun "effort" with the "-ing" suffix added, creating a non-standard verb/adjective.
