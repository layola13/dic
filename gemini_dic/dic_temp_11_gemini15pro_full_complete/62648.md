enfree:/ɛnˈfriː/ | adj. | 自由的，不受约束的 |  Freed from constraints, liberated.  Likely a non-standard or informal word, possibly a neologism combining "en-" (meaning to put into or cause to be) and "free". |  "The bird was enfreed from its cage."  这只鸟从笼子里被释放了。 | 近义词: liberated, unrestrained, free | 反义词: confined, restricted, imprisoned | 词性:形容词

词源:  Likely a blend of "en-" (a prefix meaning to put into or cause to be) and "free." Not established in standard dictionaries.  "En-" is derived from French and ultimately Latin "in-."  "Free" comes from Old English "freo."
