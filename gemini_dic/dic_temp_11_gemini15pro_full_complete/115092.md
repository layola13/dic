ETYMOLOGY->
From manganese + -ate (suffix forming nouns and adjectives denoting salts and esters of acids). The word "manganese" ultimately comes from the Italian word "manganese" (also meaning manganese), which is derived from the Latin word "magnes" (meaning magnet), due to the magnetic properties of pyrolusite, a manganese ore.
