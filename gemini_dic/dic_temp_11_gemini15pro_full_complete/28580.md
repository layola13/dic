ETYMOLOGY->
From the noun "career" (originally meaning "a racecourse," then "a rapid course"), from French "carrière" (racecourse, career), from Italian "carriera" (race, course), from Late Latin "carraria" (road for vehicles), from "carrus" (wheeled vehicle). The verb "career" initially meant "to gallop a horse at full speed," then broadened to describe any swift, uncontrolled movement.
