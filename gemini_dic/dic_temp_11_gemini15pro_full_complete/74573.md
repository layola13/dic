"Frauhola" isn't a recognized word in standard English, German, or any other common language. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.

However, if "frauhola" is intended as a neologism, perhaps combining "frau" (German for woman) and "hola" (Spanish for hello),  we can speculate on a possible interpretation and create a hypothetical entry:

frauhola:/ˈfraʊˌhoʊlə/ | n. |  A greeting specifically directed towards a woman; an informal, playful greeting. |  "Frauhola, how's it going?" 她好，最近怎么样？ | Near synonyms: hello, hi, hey | Antonyms: goodbye, farewell |  Noun
