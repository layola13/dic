词源:
"luncheonless" is formed by combining "luncheon" (meaning a midday meal) with the suffix "-less" (meaning without). "Luncheon" itself comes from the Old French word "nonechench" (meaning noon drink), which evolved from the Old English word "non" (meaning noon) and "schench" (meaning drink). Over time, the meaning shifted from a drink to a light midday meal.
