词源:  "feastable" is derived from the noun "feast" (from Old French *feste, ultimately from Latin festa), meaning a large meal, especially a celebratory one.  The suffix "-able" turns the noun into an adjective, meaning "capable of being feasted on" or "suitable for a feast." The plural form, "feastables," treats the adjective as a noun referring to things that are feastable.
