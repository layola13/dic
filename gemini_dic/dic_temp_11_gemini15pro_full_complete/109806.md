From Middle English *lewednesse*, from Old English *lēawdnes*, from *lēawd* (“lay, secular, ignorant, vulgar”) + *-nes* (suffix forming abstract nouns of quality).  The modern meaning developed from the sense of "ignorant, unlearned" to "vulgar, low-class" and finally to "sexually suggestive or indecent."
