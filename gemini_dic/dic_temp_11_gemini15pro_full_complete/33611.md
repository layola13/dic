ETYMOLOGY->
From cinchonine + -idine (a suffix used to form the names of alkaloids).  Cinchonine itself is derived from *Cinchona, the genus of trees from whose bark it is extracted.  The genus name honors the Countess of Chinchón, wife of the viceroy of Peru, who was cured of malaria by the bark in the 17th century.
