词源: This idiom originates from the early days of railroads. A switch operator's job was to change the tracks to direct trains onto the correct lines. If the operator fell asleep, the train could end up on the wrong track, leading to delays or accidents.  这个习语起源于铁路的早期。扳道工的工作是转换轨道，将火车引导到正确的线路上。如果扳道工睡着了，火车可能会开到错误的轨道上，导致延误或事故。
