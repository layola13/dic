卵黄肠系的；脐肠系的
Relating to the omphalomesenteric duct, a duct connecting the yolk sac to the primitive gut in the embryo.  This duct normally disappears during embryonic development.
The omphalomesenteric duct, also known as the vitelline duct or yolk stalk, plays a crucial role in early embryonic nutrition.
The doctor diagnosed an omphalomesenteric cyst, a rare congenital anomaly.
近义词:vitelline, yolk sac
