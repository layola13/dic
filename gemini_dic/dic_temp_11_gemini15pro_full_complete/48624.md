PHRASE->
(It is uncommon to use "defencelessly" in set phrases.  It typically describes a specific state of being rather than forming part of an idiom.)


词源：
From "defenceless" + "-ly".  "Defenceless" comes from "defence" (or "defense" in American English) + "-less".  "Defence" ultimately derives from the Old French "defens(e)," from the Latin "defensa."
