nonextensional:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnʃənl/
adj.
非外延的，内涵的
Relating to or being a property or concept that is determined by the specific characteristics of the individuals to which it applies, rather than by the class or set of all individuals to which it might apply.  A nonextensional context is one in which the truth value of a statement containing a term may change if that term is replaced by another term with the same referent.
The statement "George IV wished to know whether Scott was the author of Waverley" is nonextensional, because "Scott" and "the author of Waverley" refer to the same person, but substituting one for the other changes the truth value of the statement.
