"Mely" isn't a standard English word.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, or a proper noun (like a name).  Since it's not in standard dictionaries, providing a full lexical analysis is impossible.  However, if you meant "melody," here's the breakdown:

melody: /ˈmɛlədi/ | n. | 旋律; 曲调; 歌曲 | A sequence of single notes that is musically satisfying. |  The melody of the song was haunting and beautiful. 这首歌的旋律萦绕心头，优美动听。| The composer is known for his simple, yet effective melodies.  这位作曲家以其简洁而有效的旋律而闻名。 | synonym: tune, air, theme | antonym: dissonance, cacophony | noun
