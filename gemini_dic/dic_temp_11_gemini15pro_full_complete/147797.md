词源:
From overprotective + -ness + -es (plural).  "Overprotective" itself comes from "over-" (excessive) + "protective" (inclined to protect). "Protective" ultimately derives from the Latin "protegere" (to cover, shelter, defend).  The "-ness" suffix forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  The "-es" creates the plural form, indicating multiple instances or types of overprotectiveness.
