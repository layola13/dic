ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *molten, from Old English *meltan (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *meltaną (“to melt, malt”), from Proto-Indo-European *meld- (“to render soft, melt”). Cognate with Old Frisian melta (“to melt”), Middle Dutch smelten (“to melt, refine”), Old High German smelzan (“to melt, refine”), German schmelzen (“to melt”), Old Norse melta (“to melt, digest”).  The sense of "shed skin" developed from the idea of softening and loosening.
