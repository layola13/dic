bettermost:/ˈbetərməʊst/ | adj. | 最好的，最佳的 |  A nonstandard or dialectal word meaning "best," emphasizing the superlative degree. It's formed by adding the suffix "-most" to "better," which is already a comparative form. Considered redundant and generally not used in formal English. |  "He picked the bettermost apples from the tree." (dialectal) 他从树上摘了最好的苹果。 | 近义词: best, optimal, supreme | 反义词: worst, poorest | 词性: 形容词

词源: From "better" (comparative of "good") + "-most" (superlative suffix). The suffix "-most" is usually added to adjectives to form the superlative, but "better" is already a comparative.  Therefore, "bettermost" is a double comparative/superlative and considered non-standard.
