PHRASE->
(Generally, "flew's" isn't used in common phrases. It's a possessive form and its use depends heavily on context.  Therefore, providing phrases specifically using "flew's" is difficult and would likely be contrived and unnatural. Instead, I've provided example sentences in the various tenses above to demonstrate its usage.)
