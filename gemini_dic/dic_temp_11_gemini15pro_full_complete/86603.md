heliometric:/ˌhiːliəˈmɛtrɪk/| adj.|日视差测量的，日径测量的|Of or relating to a heliometer, an instrument for measuring small angular distances, especially the diameter of the sun.  It works by using a split lens to create two images of a celestial object, then adjusting the lens halves until the images overlap, allowing for precise measurements.|Heliometric observations were crucial in determining the distance to the sun in the 19th century.|近义词:astronomical, astrometric|反义词:N/A|词性:adjective

Etymology:
From Greek *hēlios* (sun) + *-metrikos* (measuring), from *metron* (measure).
