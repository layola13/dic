词源:  "Moonflower" is a descriptive compound word derived from "moon" and "flower," referring to its night-blooming habit. "Moon" comes from Old English "mōna," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*mēnōn," related to Latin "mēnsis" (month) and Greek "mēn" (month, moon). "Flower" comes from Old French "flour," ultimately from Latin "flōs," meaning "blossom."
