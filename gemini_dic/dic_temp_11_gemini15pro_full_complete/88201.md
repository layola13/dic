PHRASE->
(Due to the non-standard and often vulgar nature of "hims,"  common phrases are not readily available.)

注意事项:
As noted throughout, the use of "hims" is generally discouraged in standard English. "Him" is the correct objective and possessive pronoun for the third person singular masculine.  While "hims" might appear in some dialects or informal speech, it is not considered grammatically correct.
