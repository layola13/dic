词源:  From Greek "ixos" (mistletoe) + "-odian" (suffix indicating relation or resemblance).  While the original Greek "ixos" referred to mistletoe, the word evolved to encompass birdlime, a sticky substance used to trap birds, often during their migrations.  Therefore, "ixodian" became associated with migration.
