ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + articulate (to pronounce distinctly).  The root "articulate" comes from Latin "articulatus," past participle of "articulare," meaning "to utter distinctly," from "articulus" (joint, division).  The prefix "mis-" is of Old English and Germanic origin, meaning "wrongly" or "badly."
