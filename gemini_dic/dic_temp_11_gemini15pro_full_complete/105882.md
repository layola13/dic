词源: "Kitsen" is a variant of "kitchenette," a diminutive of "kitchen." It shares the same etymology, ultimately deriving from the Old English "cycene," meaning "kitchen," which itself comes from the Latin "coquina."  "Kitchenette" emerged in the late 19th century, and "kitsen" likely arose as a further shortened, informal variant.
