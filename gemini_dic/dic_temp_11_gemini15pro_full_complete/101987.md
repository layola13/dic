USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
An isochoric process occurs at a constant volume. 等容过程发生在恒定体积下。
The isochoric heat capacity is a useful thermodynamic property. 等容热容是一个有用的热力学性质。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The system is undergoing an isochoric change. 系统正在进行等容变化。
The scientist is measuring the pressure during the isochoric process. 科学家正在测量等容过程中的压力。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The volume has remained constant throughout the isochoric process. 在整个等容过程中，体积保持不变。
The experiment has demonstrated the principles of isochoric heating. 实验已经证明了等容加热的原理。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The gas has been expanding isochorically for the last hour.  过去一小时气体一直在等容膨胀。（这种情况实际上不可能发生，因为等容意味着体积不变，提供这个例句是为了满足格式要求，但实际应用中不会这样使用。）
The system has been maintained under isochoric conditions for the duration of the experiment.  在整个实验过程中，系统一直保持在等容条件下。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The reaction occurred isochorically. 反应等容发生。
The pressure increased during the isochoric heating. 在等容加热过程中，压力升高。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was undergoing an isochoric process when the power failed.  断电时系统正在进行等容过程。
The scientist was observing the isochoric change in the system.  科学家正在观察系统中的等容变化。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The volume had remained constant until the external pressure changed. 在外部压力改变之前，体积一直保持不变。
The system had reached equilibrium before the isochoric process began. 系统在等容过程开始之前就达到了平衡。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The gas had been heating isochorically for several minutes before the explosion.  爆炸前，气体已经等容加热了几分钟。 （同样，这是一个为了满足格式要求而提供的例句，实际应用中不会这样使用。）
The researchers had been studying the isochoric process for years before they published their findings. 研究人员在发表他们的发现之前，已经研究了多年的等容过程。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The experiment will be conducted under isochoric conditions. 实验将在等容条件下进行。
The volume will remain constant during the process. 在此过程中，体积将保持不变。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be undergoing an isochoric change tomorrow.  系统明天将进行等容变化。
The scientists will be monitoring the pressure during the isochoric heating. 科学家们将在等容加热过程中监测压力。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the experiment, the system will have undergone an isochoric process. 到实验结束时，系统将已经完成一个等容过程。
The temperature will have increased significantly by then. 到那时，温度将已经显著升高。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the researchers will have been studying isochoric reactions for a month. 到下周，研究人员将已经研究等容反应一个月了。
The system will have been operating under isochoric conditions for the entire duration of the test. 在整个测试过程中，系统将一直处于等容条件下运行。
