nucleoidioplasma:/ˌnjuːkliːɔɪdiˈoʊplæzəm/| n.|核质|The substance within the nucleoid of a prokaryotic cell.  It's similar to cytoplasm, but specifically refers to the material inside the nucleoid region, which contains the genetic material.|The nucleoidioplasma of the bacteria was stained for analysis.|近义词:protoplasm, cytoplasm|反义词:None|词性:Noun

Etymology:  "nucleo-" (from Latin nucleus, meaning "kernel" or "core") + "-idio-" (meaning peculiar to or characteristic of) + "-plasma" (from Greek plasma, meaning "something molded" or "formed substance").
