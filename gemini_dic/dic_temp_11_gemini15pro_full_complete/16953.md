注意事项:  "Bassnesses" is not a common word.  While grammatically correct, it sounds somewhat awkward.  "Bass" itself often functions as a noun to describe the low frequencies, and using the plural "bassnesses" to describe multiple instances of low frequencies in a piece of music, while understandable, might sound unusual to native speakers.  Using words like "low frequencies," "bass lines," or "bass notes" is often preferred.
