ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *fideler*, from Old French *fiedeleor, vièleor*, from Medieval Latin *vitula*, from Latin *vitula* (“stringed instrument”), diminutive of *vitulus* (“calf”).  The connection with "calf" is uncertain, but may refer to the material used for strings, or the shape of the instrument. The meaning “swindler, cheat” is likely derived from the idea of someone "fiddling" with things or accounts.
