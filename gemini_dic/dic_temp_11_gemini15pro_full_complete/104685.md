注意事项:
"kary" itself isn't a standalone word in common usage. It's primarily used as a prefix (karyo-) in scientific terms related to the cell nucleus, such as "karyotype," "karyokinesis" (nuclear division), and "karyoplasm" (nucleoplasm).  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses and phrases can be challenging and might involve less common or technical terms. I have focused on "karyotype" as it's the most common word derived from "kary-."
