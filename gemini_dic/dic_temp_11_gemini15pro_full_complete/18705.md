berdis:/ˈbɜːrdɪs/| n.| 小鸟（古英语，现已过时）|A berdis sat upon a bough. (一只小鸟坐在树枝上。) (古英语用法，现代英语已不再使用)| 近义词: bird (现代英语)| 反义词:  无 (因为是过时的词，没有直接的反义词)| 词性: 名词

Etymology:
From Old English *bird, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *briddiz. Cognate with Dutch vogel, German Vogel, and Danish fugl.  The -is ending is a remnant of Old English genitive and plural forms.  Over time, the word simplified to "bird."
