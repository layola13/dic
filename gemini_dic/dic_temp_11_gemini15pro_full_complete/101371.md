ionizing:/ˈaɪəˌnaɪzɪŋ/
adjective|电离的，使电离的|Causing atoms or molecules to become ions.|Ionizing radiation can be harmful to human health. 电离辐射可能对人体健康有害。|近义词:ionising (British spelling)|反义词:non-ionizing|词性:形容词

ionizing:/ˈaɪəˌnaɪzɪŋ/
verb|电离，使电离 (present participle of ionize)|The process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by adding or removing charged particles.|The gas is ionized by the high voltage.  高电压使气体电离。|近义词:ionising (British spelling)|反义词:deionizing|词性:动词


词源: From ionize + -ing.  Ionize comes from ion + -ize. Ion ultimately derives from Greek *iōn*, "going," present participle of *ienai*, "to go."
