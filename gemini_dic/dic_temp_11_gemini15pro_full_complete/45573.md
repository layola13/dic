ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *curlinge, *crulinge, equivalent to curl +‎ -ing. Cognate with Dutch krulling (“curling”), German Krullig (“curly”), Swedish krullning (“curling”).  The noun "curliness" is derived from the adjective "curly," which in turn comes from the noun "curl."  "Curl" ultimately traces back to the Middle Dutch word "crul" or "krullen," meaning "to curl" or "to crisp."
