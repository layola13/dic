ETYMOLOGY->

"Make" comes from Old English "macian," meaning "to make, form, build, do, perform."  "For" comes from Old English "for," a preposition with a complex range of meanings including "before, in front of, towards, during, because of."  The phrasal verb "make for" combines these to express directed movement or contribution to a result.
