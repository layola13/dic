autostylic:/ˈɔːtəˈstaɪlɪk/ |adj.| 自柱的，(指软骨鱼类)上颌骨与脑颅直接相连的 |Autostylic refers to a type of jaw suspension in which the palatoquadrate is directly attached to the neurocranium, without the involvement of the hyomandibula. This is characteristic of holocephalans and lungfish. |The shark's autostylic jaw allows for powerful biting.  鲨鱼的自柱式颌骨使其能够进行强有力的咬合。| synonyms:  None (highly specific term) | antonyms: hyostylic, amphistylic | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From auto- + stylic, from Greek *στῦλος (stûlos, “pillar”).
