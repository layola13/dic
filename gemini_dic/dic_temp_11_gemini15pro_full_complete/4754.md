The word "alfet" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a technical term specific to a certain field, a slang word, a regional dialect word, or even a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a proper lexical analysis for it.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, or what you think it might mean, I may be able to offer more assistance.


However, since you provided grammatical examples using "what," I can give you a detailed breakdown of *what*:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv. | 什么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. |  What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Similar: which | Opposite: (No direct opposite, depends on context) | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
