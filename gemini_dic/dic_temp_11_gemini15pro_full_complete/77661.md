gelic:/ˈdʒɛlɪk/| adj.|凝胶状的；胶质的|Resembling a gel; gelatinous. Having the properties of or containing gel.|The substance had a gelic consistency.|近义词:gelatinous, jelly-like, viscous|反义词:liquid, watery|词性:形容词

词源: From "gel" + "-ic" (suffix forming adjectives). "Gel" ultimately comes from the Latin "gelu" meaning "frost, ice, cold".
