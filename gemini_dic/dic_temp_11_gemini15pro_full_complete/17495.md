PHRASE-> (Since "bearn" is archaic, phrases are difficult to construct and sound unnatural.  Here are some examples using modern synonyms instead, focusing on the child/offspring aspect):

What's up with the kid? = 这孩子怎么了？
What the hell did the child do? = 这孩子搞什么鬼？
what if the child gets lost? = 如果孩子走丢了怎么办？
what's the present for? Is it for the child's birthday? = 这礼物是干什么用的？是送给孩子的生日礼物吗？
no matter what, I will protect my children. = 无论如何，我都会保护我的孩子。


注意事项:

由于 "bearn" 是古英语，在现代英语中已经不再使用，因此例句和词组都较为牵强，通常会被更现代的词汇取代。 在实际交流中使用 "bearn" 会显得非常不自然。
