cobaltic:/kəˈbɔːltɪk/ | adj. |钴的；含三价钴的 | Relating to or containing cobalt, especially in its +3 oxidation state. |  The cobaltic ion has a charge of +3. 三价钴离子带有+3的电荷。| Cobalt(III) oxide is a cobaltic compound. 氧化钴(III)是一种含钴的化合物。| 近义词: cobaltous (in some contexts, but refers to +2 oxidation state),  | 反义词: (No direct antonym, could be considered context-dependent based on specific chemical reactions) | 词性: 形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From *cobalt* + *-ic*.  *Cobalt* ultimately derives from German *Kobold*, meaning "goblin" or "evil spirit". Miners gave this name to cobalt ore because it was difficult to smelt and often contained arsenic, which made them sick. The suffix *-ic* is used to form adjectives indicating a higher valence state of a metal.
