注意事项:
"chist" primarily functions as an interjection, similar to "shh."  Its use as a noun meaning "chest" is largely dialectal, particularly in Scottish and Northern English dialects.  The conjugated verb forms provided (e.g., "chist-ed") are less common and might sound archaic or contrived in modern usage.  It's generally more natural to use "told someone to be quiet" or "hushed" instead.
