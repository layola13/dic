ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *hyll (attested in compounds), from Proto-Germanic *hulniz (compare West Frisian hille, Dutch heuvel (“mound, hillock”), German Hügel (“hill, knoll”), Norwegian and Swedish hyll (“shelf”), Norwegian hul (“hole, pit”)), from Proto-Indo-European *kel- (“to rise, be prominent; hill”).  Related to holt.  The meaning "heap, mound" is probably a later development.
