Etymology:
"Over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *ubari) meaning "above, beyond, across."
"Object" (from Latin objectus, past participle of obicere "to throw before, oppose," from ob- "against, toward" + jacere "to throw").
"Over-objected" combines these to mean "opposed beyond what is reasonable or necessary."
