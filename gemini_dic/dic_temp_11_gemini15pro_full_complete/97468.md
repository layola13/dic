ingena is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  If you intended a different word, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist.

However, since the prompt requests information about the word "what," I can provide an analysis for that word:
