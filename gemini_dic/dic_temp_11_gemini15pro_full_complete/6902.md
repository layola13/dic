词源：
"anchorman" is a compound word formed from "anchor" and "man."  "Anchor" in this context refers to the main presenter of a news program, the one who holds the program together. This metaphorical use of "anchor" likely arose from the nautical term, where an anchor provides stability.  "Man" simply specifies the gender of the presenter.  Although "anchor" is now often used as a gender-neutral term, "anchorman" specifically refers to a male presenter.


注意事项：
While "anchorman" is still used, it's becoming increasingly common to use the gender-neutral term "anchor" or "news anchor" instead.  "Anchorwoman" is also used to refer specifically to a female news presenter.
