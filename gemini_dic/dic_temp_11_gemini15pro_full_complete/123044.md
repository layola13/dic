moneran:/məˈnɪərən/ | n. | 原核生物 | A single-celled organism belonging to the kingdom Monera (or Prokaryotae), characterized by the absence of a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles.  These include bacteria and cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). | Example: Monerans are the simplest form of life. 原核生物是最简单的生命形式。

Example:  Scientists are studying the diverse metabolic pathways of monerans. 科学家正在研究原核生物的各种代谢途径。 | 近义词: prokaryote | 反义词: eukaryote | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Modern Latin *Monēra, neuter plural of monērēs (“single, solitary”), from Ancient Greek μονήρης (monḗrēs, “single, solitary, lonely”).  The term was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866.
