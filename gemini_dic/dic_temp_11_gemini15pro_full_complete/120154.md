Etymology:
From mincing + -ness.  Mincing itself comes from the verb "mince,"  from Old French "mincier"  meaning "to cut small," ultimately from Frankish *minson, from a Germanic base also represented by Old English "minsian" "to lessen, diminish." The sense development from "cutting small" to "affectedly dainty" likely arose from the idea of taking small, delicate steps.
