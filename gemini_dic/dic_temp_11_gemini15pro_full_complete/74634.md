词源:  "Free" and "easy" are both Old English words. The hyphenated compound "free-and-easy" emerged in the 18th century, likely influenced by similar constructions like "free-and-clear".  "Free" retains its sense of liberty and lack of constraint, while "easy" adds the connotation of informality and relaxation.
