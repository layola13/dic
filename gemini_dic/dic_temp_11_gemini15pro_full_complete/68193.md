词源:
The term "fair and square" originated in the 16th century. "Fair" has its roots in Old English "fæger," meaning "beautiful, fitting, pleasing."  "Square" comes from Old French "esquarre" (modern French "équerre"), meaning "square," ultimately from Latin "exquadra." The combination emphasized both the aesthetic and ethical dimensions of proper conduct, suggesting something both pleasing and upright.
