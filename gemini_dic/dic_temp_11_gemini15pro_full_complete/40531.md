词源: From "controlling" + "-ly". "Controlling" comes from the verb "control," which originates from the Old French "contreroller" (to check, verify, keep a duplicate register of accounts), itself from "contre-" (against) + "roller" (to enroll).  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "controlling" into an adverb.
