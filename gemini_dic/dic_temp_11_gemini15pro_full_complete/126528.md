词源:  "Nab" itself is an archaic term meaning to catch or seize. "Nab it" likely evolved to mean "catch it" or "get it" as in acquiring a habit. Over time, it morphed into the single word "nabit."  However, this etymology is somewhat speculative and not definitively proven.  Some sources suggest a possible connection to the Middle Dutch word "knappen," meaning to snap or break.  Given the uncertain etymology, it's considered a colloquial or informal term.
