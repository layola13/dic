Etymology:
From Late Middle English *immortalite*, borrowed from Old French *immortalité*,  from Late Latin *immortalitās*, from Latin *immortālis* ("immortal") + *-itās* (suffix forming abstract nouns of quality).  *Immortālis* is from *in-* (prefix meaning "not") + *mortālis* ("mortal").  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mer-*  ("to die").
