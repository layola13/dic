词源：
From Old English *ċeorl "man, freeman, peasant," from Proto-Germanic *karlaz "man, free man" (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian kerl "man," Middle Dutch kaerle, Dutch kerel "fellow, guy," Old High German charal "man," German Kerl "fellow, churl").  The meaning deteriorated from "freeman" to "peasant" to "rude, boorish person."
