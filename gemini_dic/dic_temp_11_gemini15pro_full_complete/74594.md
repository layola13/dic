词源: From "freak" (n.) + "-y" (adj. suffix) + "-est" (superlative suffix). "Freak" originally referred to a sudden capricious change of mind, whim, or fancy.  Later it came to mean a person or thing that is markedly unusual or abnormal, and from there, the adjective "freaky" and its superlative "freakiest" developed.
