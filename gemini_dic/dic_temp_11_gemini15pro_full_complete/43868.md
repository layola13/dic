注意事项:
*  "Cresorcin" appears to be a misspelling.  The correct term is "cresorcinol."
*  While there are no strict antonyms for chemical compounds,  one might consider substances with opposing functions, like emollients (moisturizers), as loosely antonymous in a practical sense, as they have opposite effects on the skin.
