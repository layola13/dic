ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *draggen*, from Old English *dragan* ("to draw, pull, drag"), from Proto-Germanic *draganą* ("to draw, pull"), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰregʰ-*. Cognate with Dutch *dragen* ("to carry, wear"), German *tragen* ("to carry, wear"), and Icelandic *draga* ("to draw, pull"). The sense of "to dredge" arose from the action of dragging a dredge across the bottom of a body of water.
