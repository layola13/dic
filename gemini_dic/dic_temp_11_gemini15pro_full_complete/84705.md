Example provided for illustrative purposes only.) The handicapped's parking space was close to the entrance. 残疾人的停车位靠近入口。 | 近义词: (Avoid using direct synonyms as they are also problematic. Focus on person-first language.)  person with a disability's, disabled person's (also outdated) | 反义词:  (Not applicable - there's no opposite of "belonging to someone with a disability.") | 词性:  Possessive noun (formed from the outdated adjective "handicapped")
