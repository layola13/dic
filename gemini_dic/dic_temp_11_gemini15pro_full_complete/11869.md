词源:

"arrived-at" is a compound adjective/noun formed from the past participle of the verb "arrive" (meaning "to reach a destination or conclusion") and the preposition "at."  The combination signifies a state of having reached a particular point or agreement.  "Arrive" itself has roots in Old French "ariver," ultimately from Latin "arripare" meaning "to come to shore."
