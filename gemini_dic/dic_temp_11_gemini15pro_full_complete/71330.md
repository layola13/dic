ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "flabbergast," which likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. Its exact etymology is uncertain, but it may be a blend of "flabber" (meaning to flap or wobble loosely) and "gast" (meaning to frighten or terrify, related to "aghast").  This suggests the image of someone so shocked that they are rendered speechless and unsteady.
