hyperpolarization:/ˌhaɪpərˌpəʊləraɪˈzeɪʃn/ /ˌhaɪpərˌpoʊlərəˈzeɪʃn/ | n. | 超极化 |The process of increasing the negativity of the membrane potential of a cell, making it less likely to generate an action potential.  This moves the membrane potential further away from the threshold potential. |The drug caused hyperpolarization of the nerve cells.  这种药物导致了神经细胞的超极化。| repolarization, afterpotential | depolarization | noun
