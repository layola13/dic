Etymology:
From Middle English *blowen, past participle of blowen (“to bloom, blossom”).  Related to Old English blōwan (“to blow, blossom”).  The original sense referred to blossoming flowers, and later evolved to describe a flushed, disheveled appearance, perhaps suggestive of a flower that has bloomed past its prime.
