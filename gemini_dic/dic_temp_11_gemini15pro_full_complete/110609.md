ETYMOLOGY->
Shortened form of *limousine*, which comes from the French region of Limousin.  Originally, a hooded cloak worn by the shepherds of that region, the term later applied to a type of horse-drawn carriage with a hooded covering for the passengers and the driver exposed to the elements.  This carriage type eventually led to the enclosed passenger car that we know today as a limousine.
