ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + barbarousness.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "barbarousness" is derived from "barbarous," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "bárbaros," meaning "foreign, strange, non-Greek."  The Greeks used this term to refer to people who did not speak Greek, considering them uncivilized.
