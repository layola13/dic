millibar:/ˈmɪlɪbɑːr/ (US), /ˈmɪlɪbɑː(r)/ (UK)| n.|毫巴|A unit of atmospheric pressure equal to one thousandth of a bar.|The atmospheric pressure was 1012 millibars.|Synonyms: hectopascal (hPa) |Antonyms: N/A|noun
millibar:|/ˈmɪlɪbɑːr/ (US), /ˈmɪlɪbɑː(r)/ (UK)| 中文翻译：毫巴|英文解析: A unit of atmospheric pressure equal to one thousandth of a bar, now largely replaced by the hectopascal which has the same value.  It is derived from "milli-" (meaning one thousandth) + "bar" (a unit of pressure).|例句：The weather forecast predicted a low pressure system of 998 millibars. 天气预报预测低压系统为998毫巴。|例句：The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 1013 millibars.  海平面标准大气压约为1013毫巴。|近义词：hectopascal (hPa)|反义词: N/A|noun
