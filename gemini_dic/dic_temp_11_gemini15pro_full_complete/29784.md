ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of "catty-corner" and "kitty-corner" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's a corruption of the French phrase "quatre coins" (four corners), which could refer to the four corners of an intersection.  Another theory links it to the Scottish word "cater-cornered," meaning diagonal.
