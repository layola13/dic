注意事项: I-spy predominantly functions as a noun referring to the game itself. While "spy" can be used as a verb, within the context of the game, it generally appears within the set phrase "I spy..." and isn't conjugated in other tenses as a stand-alone verb related to the game.  Outside the game context, "spy" functions as a verb and a noun with its own conjugations and usages relating to espionage.
