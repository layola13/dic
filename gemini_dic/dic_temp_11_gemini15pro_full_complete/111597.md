词源:
"lobster" comes from the Old English "loppestre", a compound of "loppe" (spider) and "estre" (a suffix denoting a female animal).  "Pot" comes from the Old English "pott".  Therefore, "lobster-pot" literally refers to a pot-like trap for catching creatures resembling spiders (due to their multiple legs).
