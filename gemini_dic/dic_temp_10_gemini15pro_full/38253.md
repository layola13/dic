ETYMOLOGY->
From Spanish *camarada* "roommate," from Latin *camera* "chamber, room."  The word originally referred to someone sharing a room or living quarters, and later evolved to denote a close companion, especially in a military or political context.  The political connotation, particularly associated with socialist and communist movements, became prominent in the 20th century.
