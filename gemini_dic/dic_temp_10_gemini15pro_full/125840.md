PHRASE->
(This word is archaic and not commonly used in phrases.  Therefore, I will provide phrases using the modern equivalent, "murder".)

commit murder =  犯谋杀罪
solve a murder = 破获一起谋杀案
investigate a murder = 调查一起谋杀案
a murder case =  一宗谋杀案
murder weapon = 凶器

注意事项:
由于murth是一个古语，现在几乎不用，所以例句和词组都用它的现代同义词murder来表示。
