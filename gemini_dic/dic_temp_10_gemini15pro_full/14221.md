autoclastic:/ˌɔːtəˈklæstɪk/ | adj. | 自碎屑的，同源碎屑的 | Formed from the breaking down of pre-existing rocks of the same type.  It refers to rocks composed of fragments derived from the same rock mass in which they are found, often due to processes like weathering or faulting. |  The autoclastic breccia was formed by the shattering of the original limestone formation.  这自碎屑角砾岩是由原始石灰岩地层的破碎形成的。

The geologist identified the rock sample as an autoclastic conglomerate. 地质学家将该岩石样本鉴定为自碎屑砾岩。 | 近义词: autochthonous,  | 反义词: allochthonous | 词性: adjective
