词源：

"Escapism" comes from the word "escape" with the suffix "-ism" added.  "Escape" originates from the Old French word "escaper," which in turn comes from the Latin "excappare," meaning "to slip out of one's cape" (and thus, to get away).  The suffix "-ism" derives from Greek and Latin and is used to form nouns that denote doctrines, beliefs, principles, or practices.
