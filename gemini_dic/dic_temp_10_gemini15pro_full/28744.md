词源: From Middle French *carnation, from Old French incarnacion (“incarnation, flesh colour”), from Late Latin incarnātiō (“act of assuming flesh”), from incarnātus (“made flesh”), past participle of incarnō (“make into flesh”), from in (“in, into”) + carnō (“make into flesh”), from carō (“flesh”).  Influenced by Latin carnātiō (“fleshiness”), and by the flower's fleshy pink colour.
