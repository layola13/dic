注意事项:

"limpo" is a Portuguese word, not English.  This entire explanation assumes the user intends to use the Portuguese word. There is no direct English equivalent that captures the same nuance. While "clean" is the closest translation, "limpo" can sometimes imply a more thorough or sparkling clean.  If the user intended an English word, they should clarify.
