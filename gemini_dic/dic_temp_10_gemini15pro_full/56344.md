词源:  "dog sleep" is a figurative expression.  It likely arose from the observation that dogs often seem to sleep lightly and are easily awakened.  The word "dog" is used to modify "sleep" to indicate a less deep and more easily interrupted form of sleep.  The exact origin is unknown, but the phrase is centuries old.
