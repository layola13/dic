注意事项:

*  "Oncest" is considered archaic or dialectal and is rarely used in modern English.  "Once" is the preferred and more common form.  Using "oncest" can sound awkward or unnatural in many contexts.  The provided examples highlight where its usage is most acceptable and where it becomes strained.  Using "once" in place of "oncest" in almost all situations is recommended.
* The provided examples for tenses where "oncest" feels unnatural are included for completeness, but using "once" is strongly advised in those cases.  It's important to prioritize natural and fluent English over strictly adhering to the example structure when the word itself lends itself poorly to certain grammatical constructions.
