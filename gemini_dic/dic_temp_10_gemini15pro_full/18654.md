benzoyl:/ˈben.zɔɪl/ | n. | 苯甲酰 |  A univalent radical, C₇H₅O, derived from benzoic acid by removal of the hydroxyl radical. It forms numerous compounds, such as benzoyl chloride. | Benzoyl peroxide is a common ingredient in acne treatments. 过氧化苯甲酰是痤疮治疗中的常见成分。| 近义词: (As a functional group, it doesn't have direct synonyms, but related terms include arylcarbonyl, aroyl) | 反义词: None | 词性: noun

Etymology: From *benzoic* + *-yl*.  *Benzoic* ultimately derives from Arabic *lubān jāwī* (لبان جاوي), meaning "Javan frankincense" (via Middle French *benjoin*), referring to gum benzoin, from which benzoic acid was first derived.  *-yl* is a suffix used in organic chemistry to denote a radical.
