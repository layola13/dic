注意事项:

"Naru" is primarily used in Japanese.  While the provided information attempts to present it as an English word with equivalent meanings, it's important to understand this is a conceptual translation for learning purposes.  It isn't a standard English word.  Using "become," "get," "turn," or "grow" is more natural and accurate in English communication.
