conductively:/kənˈdʌk.tɪv.li/
|adv.|传导地，导电地|In a way that allows heat or electricity to pass through.  |Heat travels conductively through metal. 热量通过金属传导。|Synonym: transmittingly,  |Antonym: resistively|Adverb

Etymology->
From "conductive" + "-ly".  "Conductive" comes from Late Latin "conductivus", from "conduct-" (past participle stem of "conducere" - to lead or bring together) + "-ive".
