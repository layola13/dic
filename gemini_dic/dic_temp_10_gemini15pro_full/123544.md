monoxide:/ˈmɒnɒksaɪd/ (UK) /məˈnɑːksaɪd/ (US)| n.|一氧化物|A compound containing one oxygen atom in each molecule.|Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas.|一氧化碳是一种有毒气体。

Carbon monoxide detectors are essential for home safety.|一氧化碳探测器对家庭安全至关重要。|近义词: oxide (更广义的氧化物)|反义词:  N/A (没有直接的反义词)|词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From mono- + oxide.  "Mono-" comes from Greek monos "single, alone." "Oxide" comes from French oxide and ultimately from Greek oxus "sharp, acid," referring to the observation that many oxides form acidic solutions in water.
