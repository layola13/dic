词源： "Findy" likely originates from the verb "find," suggesting the ability to skillfully or cleverly locate things.  While not a standard dictionary entry, it's used colloquially in some dialects, particularly in Scotland and parts of northern England. Its meaning has evolved to encompass a broader sense of being discerning or picky, beyond simply being good at finding things.
