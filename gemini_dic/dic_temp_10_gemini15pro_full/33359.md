ETYMOLOGY->
From chump + -ish + -ness + -es (plural).  "Chump" originated in the late 19th century, likely from a dialectal word meaning "thick piece of wood," later evolving to mean "a stupid person." The suffix "-ish" forms adjectives, "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state or quality, and "-es" marks the plural.
