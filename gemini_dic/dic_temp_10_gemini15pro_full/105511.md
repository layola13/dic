kilohertz:/ˈkɪləhɜːrts/ (US), /ˈkɪləhɜːtz/ (UK)| n. |千赫兹|A unit of frequency equal to one thousand hertz.|The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 kilohertz.  这广播电台以98.5千赫兹的频率广播。|Synonyms: kHz|Antonyms: (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement, but one could consider lower units like hertz or fractions of a hertz)|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From kilo- + hertz.  Kilo- is a combining form representing a thousand, from the Greek khilioi "thousand".  Hertz is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857-1894), German physicist, who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves.
