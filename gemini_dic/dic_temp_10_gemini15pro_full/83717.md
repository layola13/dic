词源：From Old English hægtesse "witch," from Proto-Germanic *hagatusjon- (source also of Old Norse hagr "witchcraft," Middle Dutch haghetisse "enchantress"). The -s ending is a later addition.  The original meaning was simply "female demon, supernatural being." Over time, the word came to be associated with ugliness and old age, giving it the negative connotations it has today.
