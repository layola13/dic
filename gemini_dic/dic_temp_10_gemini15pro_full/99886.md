注意事项:  Note that "internality's" with the apostrophe-s is technically a possessive form, meaning "belonging to an internality." While the examples above use it in a way that's grammatically similar to "qualities" or "factors," it might be more standard and clearer to use "internalities" (without the apostrophe) in most cases.
