mitoses: /maɪˈtoʊsiːz/ | n. | 有丝分裂 | The process of cell division by which the nucleus divides, typically consisting of four stages (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) resulting in two new nuclei each containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. | During the cell cycle, the cell undergoes a series of events including growth, DNA replication, and mitoses.  在细胞周期中，细胞经历一系列事件，包括生长、DNA复制和有丝分裂。|  Mitosis is essential for growth and repair in multicellular organisms. 有丝分裂对于多细胞生物的生长和修复至关重要。 | synonyms: cell division, karyokinesis | antonyms: meiosis | noun
