PHRASE->
(Not applicable for 'coolness's', as it's an unusual and awkward construction. Native speakers would rarely, if ever, use this possessive form.  Instead, they would say "the coolness of the..."  Therefore, providing phrases using 'coolness's' would be unnatural and unhelpful.)

注意事项:
The word "coolness's" is grammatically correct, but it's very uncommon and sounds awkward. It's much more natural to use "the coolness of" something.  For instance, "the coolness of the evening" is preferable to "the evening's coolness," and definitely better than "the coolness's of the evening."  While the possessive form is technically allowed, it's best avoided for smoother, more natural-sounding English.
