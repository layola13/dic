atmology: /ætˈmɒlədʒi/ (This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.)

There is no recognized word "atmology" in English.  It appears to be a conflation or misspelling, perhaps intending "atomology" or "atmology," though neither of these are standard words either.  If "atomology" was intended, it could be a neologism referencing the study of atoms, though "atomic physics" or "nuclear physics" are already established terms. If "atmology" was intended, it could be a neologism related to "atmosphere," but its meaning would be unclear without further context.  Because it's not a recognized word, a standard lexical analysis cannot be provided.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
