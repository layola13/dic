ETYMOLOGY->
From "good" + "natured".  "Good" comes from Old English "gōd," related to German "gut." "Natured" comes from Old French "nature," from Latin "natura," meaning "essential qualities, innate disposition."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun "nature" into an adjective indicating possession of the quality described by the noun.
