nonionizing:/ˌnɒnˈaɪənaɪzɪŋ/ | adj. | 非电离的 | Not capable of causing ionization; referring to radiation that does not have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. |  Visible light is a form of nonionizing radiation. 可见光是一种非电离辐射。 |  non-ionizing, non-ionising | ionizing, ionising | adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + ionizing.  "Ionizing" comes from the verb "ionize," which ultimately derives from the Greek word "ion," meaning "going."  It refers to the process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by adding or removing charged particles (electrons).
