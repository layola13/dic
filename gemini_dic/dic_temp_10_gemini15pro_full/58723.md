Etymology: From *dunce* + *-ish*.  *Dunce* originally referred to the followers of John Duns Scotus, a 13th-century philosopher whose teachings later fell out of favor and were considered outdated and foolish. The suffix *-ish* turns a noun into an adjective, indicating resemblance or characteristic.
