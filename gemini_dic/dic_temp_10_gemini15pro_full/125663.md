注意事项:

词源:  From earlier *mumpes, plural of *mumpe ("grimace; mumps"), from obsolete mump ("to mumble; to grimace"), of uncertain origin.  Related to mummer.


"Mumps's" is grammatically unusual. While possessive form is sometimes used with diseases (e.g., "Alzheimer's"), it's less common with "mumps."  "Mumps" itself is generally treated as a plural noun, but can also function singularly.  Therefore, "mumps" is the more typical and recommended usage.
