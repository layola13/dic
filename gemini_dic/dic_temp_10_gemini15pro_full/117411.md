1. Properly medicined wound = 正确用药的伤口


2.  A medicined injury = 接受过药物治疗的伤


3.  A recently medicined patient = 最近接受过药物治疗的病人


4. Thoroughly medicined area = 彻底用药的区域

"Medicined" is not as common as "treated" or "medicated". "Medicated" is generally preferred when referring to ongoing treatment with medicine.
