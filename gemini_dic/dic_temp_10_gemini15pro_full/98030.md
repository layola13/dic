inore:  (This word doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.)

Since "inore" isn't a recognized English word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "ignore" (ɪɡˈnɔːr/  v. 忽视,不理睬), "inshore" (ɪnˈʃɔːr/ adj./adv. 近岸的/地), "inure" (ɪnˈjʊər/ v.  使习惯于), or another word.
* **A technical term or slang:** Specific fields or subcultures sometimes develop their own vocabulary.
* **A neologism:**  Someone may have coined this word, but it hasn't gained widespread usage.
* **Part of a proper noun:** It could be part of a name, like a company or product.


If you can provide more context — where you encountered this word, what you think it might mean — I might be able to offer more assistance.
