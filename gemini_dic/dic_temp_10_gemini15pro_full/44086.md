词源: From Old Norse *krupila, frequentative of krjúpa "to creep," from Proto-Germanic *kreupaną "to creep, crawl," from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kreu- "to bend, curve."  The original meaning related to crawling or creeping, reflecting the movement of someone with impaired legs.  Over time, the meaning expanded to encompass any form of serious impairment or damage.
