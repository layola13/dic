ETYMOLOGY->
From free + wheel (verb) + -ing (suffix forming present participles and gerunds).  "Free wheel" originally referred to a mechanism on a bicycle or other vehicle that allows the driven wheels to rotate independently of the pedals or engine.  This mechanical sense was then extended metaphorically to describe a person or organization acting independently and without constraint.
