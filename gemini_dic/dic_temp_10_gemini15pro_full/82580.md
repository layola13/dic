词源: From "guarded" + "-ness". "Guarded" comes from the verb "guard," which originates from the Old French "garder" (to keep, protect), ultimately from the Frankish "*wardon," related to the Old High German "wartēn" (to watch). The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
