ETYMOLOGY->
From citizen + -ship.  Citizen comes from Middle English *citezein*, from Anglo-Norman *citezein*, from Old French *citeien*, ultimately from Latin *civitatem* (nominative *civitas*) "citizenship, state, city," from *civis* "citizen."  The suffix *-ship* forms abstract nouns of state, condition, or quality.
