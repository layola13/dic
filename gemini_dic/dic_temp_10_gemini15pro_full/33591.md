词源:  "Cimbia" likely derives from Latin "cingula," meaning "girdle" or "belt."  There isn't extensive documentation of "cimbia" in modern English, suggesting it might be archaic, a regional variant, or even a constructed word.  Its similarity to "cingulum" (another Latin word for belt) further reinforces the likely Latin root.
