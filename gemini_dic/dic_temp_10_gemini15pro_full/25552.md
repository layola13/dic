"bultel" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis. It might be:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant "buttle," which is a variant of "butler."
* **A proper noun:**  A surname, place name, or brand name.
* **A technical term:**  Specific to a particular field.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, assuming you meant "buttle" (as in a variant of "butler"), I can provide an analysis for that:

buttle: /ˈbʌtl/ | n. | 男管家; (尤指旧时富贵人家或机构中的)服务员 | A male servant, especially the chief manservant of a large household. |例句：He worked as a buttle for a wealthy family. 他在一个富裕的家庭里当男管家。

|例句： The buttle announced the guests' arrival. 男管家宣布了客人的到来。| 近义词： butler, manservant, servant | 反义词: master, employer | noun
