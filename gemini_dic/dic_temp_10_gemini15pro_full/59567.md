ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *Ebionītae*, from Greek *Ἐβιωναῖοι (Ebionaioi)*, meaning "the poor," perhaps from Hebrew *אֶבְיוֹנִים (evyonim)* "poor ones," from *אֶבְיוֹן (evyon)* "poor, needy." The name may reflect their self-perception as the "poor" or "humble" followers of Jesus, or it might have been a derogatory term used by their opponents.
