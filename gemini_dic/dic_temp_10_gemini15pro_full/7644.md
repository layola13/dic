annuloida:/ˌænjuˈlɔɪdə/ | n. |环节动物门（已废弃）|A former phylum or other high-level grouping of invertebrates including annelids, echiurans, sipunculans, and sometimes other groups. This classification is now obsolete.  | Annuloida was once considered a valid phylum, grouping segmented worms with other worm-like creatures. 环节动物门曾被认为是一个有效的门，将分节蠕虫与其他蠕虫状生物归为一类。 | 近义词: None (The term is obsolete, and modern classifications use different phyla.) | 反义词: None | 词性: Noun
