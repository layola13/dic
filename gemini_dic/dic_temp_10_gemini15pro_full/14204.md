autocat:/ˈɔːtəʊkæt/ | n. |自动催化剂；自动催化反应|A substance that catalyzes a reaction in which it is itself produced, so that the reaction becomes progressively faster.|The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is autocatalyzed by manganese dioxide. 过氧化氢的分解是由二氧化锰自动催化的。| 近义词: catalyst | 反义词: inhibitor | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From auto- + catalyst.  "Auto-" comes from Greek "autos" meaning "self". "Catalyst" comes from Greek "katalysis" meaning "dissolution."
