词源:
"Nonaccords" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "accords" (meaning "agreements").  "Accord" comes from the Old French "acort" or "acord,"  ultimately derived from the Latin "ad" (to) and "cor" (heart).  Therefore, "nonaccords" literally means "not to the heart" or "not in agreement."
