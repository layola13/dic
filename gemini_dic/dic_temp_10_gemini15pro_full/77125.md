词源：Gaslighting derives from the 1938 play "Gas Light" (later made into films in 1940 and 1944), in which a husband manipulates his wife into believing she is losing her mind by dimming the gas lights in their home and then denying that the lights have changed.  This term has since become a popular term for psychological manipulation.
