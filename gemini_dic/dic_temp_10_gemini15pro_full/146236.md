overexpress:/ˌoʊvərɪkˈsprɛs/| v. |过度表达|To express (a gene) to a higher degree than normal.  To produce an excessive amount of a gene product (such as a protein).|The researchers overexpressed the protein in the cells to study its effects. 研究人员在细胞中过度表达了这种蛋白质来研究它的作用。

The gene was overexpressed in the tumor cells. 该基因在肿瘤细胞中过度表达。|近义词：upregulate, amplify|反义词：underexpress, downregulate|词性:动词

Etymology: over- + express.  "Over-" signifies "excessively" or "to an excessive degree." "Express" in this context refers to the biological process of gene expression, where information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.
