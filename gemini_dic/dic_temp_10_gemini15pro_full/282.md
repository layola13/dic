abegge: /ˈɑːbɛɡə/ (This pronunciation is a best guess based on likely Germanic origins, as the word isn't found in standard dictionaries.) | n. |  煽动; 唆使 (This meaning is conjectured based on possible etymological connections, see below.) |  Possibly derived from a combination of Old English or Old Norse elements suggesting incitement or encouragement.  The closest potential cognates might be Old Norse "eggja" (to egg on) and Old English "ābycgan" (to buy, redeem, which could metaphorically extend to influencing someone's actions). This is speculative, as "abegge" is not a recognized word in modern or historical English dictionaries. | No attested examples exist, as "abegge" is not a recognized word.  A fabricated example based on the conjectured meaning could be: "He abegged the riot with his fiery speech." 他用他激烈的演讲煽动了暴乱。 | Near synonyms (based on conjectured meaning): incite, instigate, provoke, goad | Antonyms (based on conjectured meaning):  pacify, calm, soothe, quell | noun
