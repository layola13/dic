The word "nigerois" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism possibly derived from the French word "nigérois," which is the demonym for someone from Niger.  Due to its phonetic similarity to a highly offensive racial slur, using this word, even if intending the French meaning, is strongly discouraged.  It is extremely likely to be misinterpreted and cause offense.  If you are referring to someone from Niger, the correct and appropriate term is "Nigerien."

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling so I can give you accurate information.
