ETYMOLOGY->
Derived from the 1938 play "Gas Light" (later made into films in 1940 and 1944) by Patrick Hamilton, in which a husband manipulates his wife into thinking she is going insane by dimming the gas lights in their home and then denying it. The term became widely used in the 1970s to describe this form of psychological abuse.
