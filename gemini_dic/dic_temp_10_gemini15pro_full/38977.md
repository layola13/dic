ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French  *confinement*, from  *confine*, "border, limit," from Latin  *confīnis*,  "bordering, adjacent," from  *con-*, "together," + *fīnis*, "end, limit."  The meaning shifted to "restriction within limits" and later to "imprisonment." The sense of "period of childbirth" arose because of the enforced bed rest traditionally associated with it.
