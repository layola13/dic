chalice: /ˈtʃælɪs/ | n. | 圣杯；酒杯；杯状物 | A cup or goblet, often used in religious ceremonies, especially the Eucharist. | The priest raised the chalice.  神父举起了圣杯。 |  The knight drank from the chalice. 骑士从圣杯里喝了一口。| 近义词: goblet, cup | 反义词:  (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun

词源: From Old French *calice*, from Latin *calix* (meaning "cup, goblet"), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *kel- (meaning "to hide, conceal," later "something hollow").  The semantic shift likely occurred because cups are hollow vessels.
