词源:  "in-law" comes from Old English *inlagu, meaning "in-law." The "in-" prefix signifies connection or relationship, while "law" in this context derives from Old Norse lagu, meaning "law," but in a broader sense of established custom or practice, referring to the legal and social bonds created through marriage.
