curvirostres:/ˌkɜːrvɪˈrɒstriːz/| n. |曲喙鸟类|A taxonomic group of birds characterized by their curved beaks.  This term is outdated and no longer widely used in modern ornithology.  It historically referred to a diverse group including birds like parrots, toucans, and woodpeckers.|Example:  The curvirostres, as they were once called, encompassed a wide variety of bird species.  曾经被称为曲喙鸟类的群体包含了各种各样的鸟类物种。|Synonym:  (No direct modern synonym due to obsolete nature of term. Could list related modern taxonomic groups like Psittaciformes (parrots), Piciformes (woodpeckers), etc. depending on context.)|Antonym: (None.  Taxonomic groups don't typically have antonyms.)|Noun
