fsb:/ɛf ɛs biː/ |abbr.| 前端总线（Front Side Bus）|The front-side bus (FSB) is a computer communication interface (bus) that was often used in Intel-chipset-based computers during the 1990s and 2000s.  It typically carries data between the central processing unit (CPU) and a memory controller hub. |The motherboard has a 1333 MHz FSB.  该主板有一个1333兆赫的前端总线。| 近义词: (depending on context) system bus, processor bus, memory bus | 反义词: N/A | noun
