ETYMOLOGY->
From over + presumptuous + -ly.  "Over" intensifies the meaning of "presumptuous," which comes from Late Latin praesumptuosus "daring, audacious," from Latin praesumptus, past participle of praesumere "to anticipate, take beforehand, take for granted," from prae- "before" + sumere "to take."  The suffix "-ly" forms adverbs.
