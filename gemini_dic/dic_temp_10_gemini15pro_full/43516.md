词源：From Old English *cravian, *creafian, from Proto-Germanic *krabōną (“to scratch, crawl, crave”). Cognate with Middle Low German kraven (“to crave”), Middle Dutch craven (“to beg”), Old High German chraffōn (“to scratch”), German kraben (“to scratch, scrape”). Related to crab (n.). The sense development from "scratch" to "crave" might be via the image of scratching at the earth like a hungry bird.
