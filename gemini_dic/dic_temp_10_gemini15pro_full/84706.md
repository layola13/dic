**注意事项：**  "Handicapped" is now considered outdated and potentially offensive.  It is generally preferred to use "disabled," "person with a disability," or "people with disabilities."  This is because "handicapped" focuses on the limitations, whereas "disabled" or "person with a disability" acknowledges the person first and the disability second.
