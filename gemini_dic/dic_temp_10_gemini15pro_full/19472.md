The word "bidarkee" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that this is a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe it might mean, I might be able to offer some suggestions.


However, since you requested examples of how to use "what" in different grammatical contexts, I can provide that information:


what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv.| 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun/Determiner/Adverb
