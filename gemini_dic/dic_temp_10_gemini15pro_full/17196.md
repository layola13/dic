ETYMOLOGY->
From baulky + -ness.  Baulky originates from balk (meaning "to stop short and refuse to proceed"), which likely comes from a Scandinavian source related to Old Norse *balkr ("ridge," "partition").  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "baulky" into the noun "baulkiness," indicating the state or quality of being baulky.
