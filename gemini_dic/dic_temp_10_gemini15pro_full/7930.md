antepredicament:/ˌæntiprɪˈdɪkəm(ə)nt/
n.
先范畴，预范畴
A concept or category that precedes and is more fundamental than the predicaments or categories of Aristotle's system of logic.  Antepredicaments are considered preliminary to the classification of beings.
Antepredicaments, such as univocity, equivocity, and analogy, are discussed before the Aristotelian categories (substance, quantity, quality, etc.) because they are essential for understanding how terms are used and how predication works.
Medieval logicians debated extensively the nature and number of antepredicaments.  Some considered them to be essential for clear thinking and proper categorization.
synonym: preliminary concept, fundamental category
antonym: predicament (in the Aristotelian sense)
noun
