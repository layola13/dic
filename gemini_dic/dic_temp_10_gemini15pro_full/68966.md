词源:
From Old English fæðm "outstretched arms, embrace," also a measure of length (the distance between the fingertips of outstretched arms), from Proto-Germanic *fathmaz (source also of Old Norse faðmr "embrace, bosom," Old Frisian fetheme, Dutch vadem, German Faden "thread, fathom"). The verb meaning "to measure by fathoms" is from late 14c.; the figurative sense of "to penetrate mentally, comprehend" is from c. 1600.
