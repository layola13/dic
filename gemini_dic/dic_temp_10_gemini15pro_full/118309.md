From Old French *merci* "thanks, grace, pity, pardon," from Latin *mercēdem*  "reward, wages, price," from *merx*  "merchandise, wares, traffic." The sense evolution in English involves the notion of giving something for nothing, or for less than it is worth, leading to the senses of "pity, compassion."
