词源:  "Fes" is a shortened form of "festival," which ultimately derives from the Latin "festivus" meaning "festive, joyous," related to "festum" meaning "feast, holiday."


注意: “fes” is not a standard English word. It's a colloquial abbreviation used primarily in informal contexts, particularly online.  While understood, using the full word "festival" is generally recommended in formal writing or speaking.
