ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *paragon*, from Italian *paragone* "touchstone", from *paragonare* "to compare, test", from Greek *para- "beside" + akone* "whetstone". Originally referred to a touchstone used to test the purity of gold.  The meaning shifted to "model of excellence" because the touchstone was considered the standard of purity.
