Etymology:
From Late Middle English *complotten*, from Old French *comploter* "to plot together," from Latin *computare* "to calculate, compute, reckon," literally "to fold together," from *com-* "together" + *putare* "to prune, cleanse, think." The sense shift from "calculate" to "plot" occurred in Vulgar Latin.
