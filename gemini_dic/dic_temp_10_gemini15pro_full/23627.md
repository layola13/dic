branchiomerism: /ˌbræŋkiˈɒmərɪzəm/ | n. |鰓節性；鰓區分節|The serial repetition of structures related to the branchial arches in vertebrates.  The segmentation of the head and neck region of vertebrates into a series of repeating units called branchiomeres, each associated with a branchial arch. |The study of branchiomerism helps us understand the development of the head and neck in vertebrates.  Branchiomerism is evident in the arrangement of the gills in fish.|近义词: metamerism, segmentation|反义词: (No direct antonym, potentially "unsegmented")|词性: noun

Etymology: From  "branchio-" (Greek βράγχια (bránkhia) "gills") + "-mere" (Greek μέρος (méros) "part") + "-ism" (suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or doctrine).
