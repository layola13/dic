ETYMOLOGY->
From the late Middle English word "characterisacioun,"  derived from the Old French "caracterizacion," ultimately stemming from the Late Latin "characterizatio,"  based on the Latin "characterizare" meaning "to characterize."  The root word "character" comes from the Greek "kharaktēr," referring to a distinguishing mark or symbol.
