From *hyper- "over, excessive" + *phosphate + *-emia "blood condition". *Hyper- comes from Greek *ὑπέρ (hupér) "over, above". *Phosphate is derived from *phosphorus, ultimately from Greek *Φωσφόρος (Phōsphóros) "light-bearing", referring to the element's chemiluminescence. *-emia comes from Greek *αἷμα (haîma) "blood".
