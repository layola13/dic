词源:  From Griffin + -esque.  Griffin comes from the Old French *grifon, ultimately from the Latin *gryphus, from the Greek γρύψ (gryps), meaning "curved, hooked".  The suffix -esque is derived from the Italian -esco, French -esque, and ultimately from the Latin -iscus.  It denotes "in the style of" or "resembling".
