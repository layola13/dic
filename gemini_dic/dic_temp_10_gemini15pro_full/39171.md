congealablenesses:/kənˌdʒiːləˈbeɪlənəsɪz/ | n. | 可凝固性；凝结性 | The quality of being congealable; the capacity to congeal or solidify. |  The congealablenesses of different oils vary greatly depending on their fatty acid composition. 不同油类的凝固性因其脂肪酸组成而差异很大。| 近义词: coagulability, solidifiability | 反义词: fluidity, liquidity | 词性: noun

Etymology: From congealable + -ness.  "Congealable" comes from the verb "congeal," from Old French "congeler," from Latin "congelare," from "com-" (together) + "gelare" (to freeze). "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
