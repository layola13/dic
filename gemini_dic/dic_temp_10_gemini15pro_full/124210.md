-mosis:/ˈmoʊsɪs/| n. |渗透，渗入| A process of osmosis, whereby molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one, thus equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.|  The absorption of water by plant roots is an example of osmosis. 植物根系对水的吸收是渗透作用的一个例子。|近义词：diffusion, permeation|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps dehydration in specific contexts) |词性: noun
