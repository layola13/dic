hyperinvolutions:/ˌhaɪpərɪnvəˈluːʃənz/ | n. | 超对合 | A hyperinvolution is a mapping from a set to itself such that when applied twice, it results in the original element. More specifically, it's an involution whose order divides a power of 2.  |  The double negation in logic can be considered a hyperinvolution. 双重否定在逻辑学中可以被认为是一种超对合。 | synonyms: involution (in some contexts), idempotent map (in some very specific contexts when the power of 2 is 1) | antonyms:  (Generally no direct antonyms, depends on the specific mapping) | noun
