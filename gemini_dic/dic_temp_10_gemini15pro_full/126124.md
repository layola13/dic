mutex:/ˈmjuːtɛks/| n.|互斥锁，互斥体|A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to protect shared resources from simultaneous access by multiple threads or processes.  It ensures that only one thread or process can hold the mutex at any given time.|The program uses a mutex to prevent race conditions when accessing the shared database. 该程序使用互斥锁来防止访问共享数据库时出现竞争条件。|近义词：lock, semaphore|反义词: N/A|词性:noun
