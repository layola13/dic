"mohads" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun (like a surname), or a word from a specific dialect or technical field.  Therefore, I can't provide a standard linguistic analysis.

However, if you can provide more context, like where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer some suggestions.  For example, if it's a misspelling, I might be able to guess the intended word and analyze that.


Here's a demonstration of the requested format using a real word, "axiom":
