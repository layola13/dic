PHRASE->
N/A (This word is not typically used in common phrases.)


注意事项:  This word is less common than "homograph," which has a broader meaning, encompassing both homalographs (same spelling, different origin) and homonyms (same spelling and pronunciation, different meaning).  Therefore, "homograph" is often used even when "homalograph" would be more technically accurate.
