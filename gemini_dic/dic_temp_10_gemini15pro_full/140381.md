Etymology:
oil (n.) + -less (suffix) + -ness (suffix)

oil: from Old French *oile (Modern French huile), from Latin oleum "oil, olive oil," from Greek elaion "olive oil," from elaia "olive tree," which is probably of pre-Greek origin.

-less: Old English -lēas "free from, without," from Proto-Germanic *-lausaz (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian -los, Dutch -loos, Old High German -los, German -los, Old Norse -lauss, Gothic -laus), from PIE root *leu- "to loosen, divide, cut apart."

-ness: Old English -nes(s), -nis(s), -nyss(e), a Germanic suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, originally identical with -ness "headland, promontory" (see ness (n.)), with the sense development perhaps influenced by Latin -ities.
