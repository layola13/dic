ETYMOLOGY->
From *arch- + marshal.  *Arch- comes from Greek *arkhos* meaning "chief," "leader," or "ruler."  Marshal comes from Old French *mareschal,* meaning "horse servant," which ultimately derives from Frankish *marhskalk* "horse servant," from *marah* "horse" + *skalk* "servant."  Over time, the role of marshal evolved from caring for horses to a high military rank.
