注意事项:

The analysis above is based on the assumption that "nidor" is a proper noun or a neologism used as a noun.  If more context is provided, a more accurate and complete analysis can be given.  Since "nidor" isn't a real word, most of the standard grammatical analysis doesn't apply.  The examples provided are purely hypothetical to illustrate how the word *might* be used if it were a real word.  The closest real-world examples would be fictional creatures or place names from books, games, or movies.  For example, "Pokemon" has creatures named "Nidoran" (male and female), "Nidorino," and "Nidoking," which are likely the inspiration for the word "nidor."
