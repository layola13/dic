fall-through:/ˈfɔːl θruː/| n.|失效，未处理的情况；穿透|An instance in programming where control passes to the next case in a switch statement because of a missing break statement.|The programmer forgot a break statement, leading to a fall-through error that caused unexpected behavior.|近义词:default behavior (in some contexts)|反义词:explicit handling|词性:名词

fall-through:|N/A| N/A|失效，未处理的情况；穿透|In programming, fall-through occurs when a case in a switch statement executes and control then proceeds to the next case because of the absence of a break statement. This can lead to unintended execution of multiple cases.|Due to the fall-through, both case 'A' and case 'B' were executed.|近义词: cascading execution (sometimes)|反义词: intentional fallthrough (when break is omitted deliberately)|词性:名词


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Fall-through occurs when a break statement is missing.  = 当缺少 break 语句时，就会发生失效。
Fall-through can be a source of bugs in switch statements. = 失效可能是 switch 语句中错误的来源。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The code is exhibiting fall-through behavior because of the missing break. = 由于缺少 break，代码正在表现出失效行为。
The debugger is showing that the execution is falling through to the next case. = 调试器显示执行正在失效到下一个case。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The program has encountered a fall-through error. = 程序遇到了失效错误。
The compiler has warned about the potential for fall-through in this switch statement. = 编译器已经警告了此 switch 语句中潜在的失效。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The tests have been failing because of unexpected fall-through. =  由于意外的失效，测试一直失败。
We have been debugging this fall-through issue for hours. = 我们一直在调试这个失效问题好几个小时了。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The bug was caused by a fall-through in the switch statement. = 这个 bug 是由 switch 语句中的失效引起的。
The program crashed because of an unexpected fall-through. = 程序由于意外的失效而崩溃了。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The code was falling through to the next case unintentionally. = 代码无意中失效到下一个case。
We were debugging the fall-through issue when we found another bug. = 我们在调试失效问题时发现了另一个 bug。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had crashed before we realized the fall-through issue. = 在我们意识到失效问题之前，程序已经崩溃了。
We had not considered the possibility of fall-through. = 我们没有考虑失效的可能性。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The code had been exhibiting fall-through behavior for a while before it was noticed. = 在被注意到之前，代码已经表现出失效行为一段时间了。
We had been struggling with this fall-through bug for days. = 我们已经为此失效 bug 挣扎了好几天。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The compiler will warn you about potential fall-through issues. = 编译器会警告您潜在的失效问题。
Adding a break statement will prevent fall-through. = 添加 break 语句将防止失效。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
We will be testing for fall-through scenarios in the next phase. = 我们将在下一阶段测试失效场景。
The team will be addressing the fall-through problem tomorrow. = 团队明天将解决失效问题。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By next week, we will have fixed the fall-through bug. = 到下周，我们将修复失效 bug。
We will have implemented a solution to prevent fall-through. = 我们将实施一个解决方案来防止失效。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the end of the project, we will have been testing for fall-through for several months. = 到项目结束时，我们将已经测试失效好几个月了。
The team will have been working on preventing fall-through issues for a significant amount of time. = 团队将花费大量时间致力于防止失效问题。


PHRASE->
unintentional fall-through = 无意的失效
fall-through bug = 失效错误
fall-through in a switch statement = switch 语句中的失效
