paramorphism:/ˈpærəmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. | 同构变换，参数多态 |A function that generalizes both folds (catamorphisms) and unfolds (anamorphisms) by allowing the result to depend both on the recursive substructures and on the original structure.|The `para` in paramorphism suggests that it's "beyond" or "alongside" a morphism, combining both reduction and generation.| 近义词: hylomorphism (in some contexts) | 反义词: N/A | noun
