"booked-up" is a phrasal verb formed from the verb "book" and the adverb "up."  "Book" comes from Old English "bōc," meaning "written document," later evolving to mean "register" and then "reserve." "Up" comes from Old English "up," meaning "upward."  The combination "booked-up" emphasizes the complete filling or reservation of something.
