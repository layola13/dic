PHRASE->
This word "dows" is rarely used in phrases.  It is simply the plural of "dow," which itself is an older, less common synonym for "widow."  Therefore, phrases aren't typically built around it.  It's more likely to see phrases using "widows," such as:
widows' pension = 寡妇抚恤金
support group for widows = 寡妇支持小组
widows and orphans = 寡妇和孤儿
war widows = 战争寡妇
widows' benefits = 寡妇福利

注意事项:

This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English. "Widows" is the preferred term.
