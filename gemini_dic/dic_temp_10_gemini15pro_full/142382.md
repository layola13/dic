orthoselection:/ˌɔːrθəʊsɪˈlɛkʃən/ | n. |正选择|The process by which advantageous mutations arising within a species are selected for by natural selection, even when interspecific competition is not a factor. This can lead to directional evolutionary change within a lineage. |Orthoselection led to the evolution of larger body size in this particular lineage of horses.| 近义词: directional selection | 反义词: N/A | noun
