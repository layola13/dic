ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *aboute, from Old English *onbūtan (“around, about, near”), equivalent to on + be + ūtan (“outside”). Cognate with Dutch omtrent (“about, approximately”), German um (“around”). More at on, by, out.  The form "abought" is an older variant, now largely obsolete.

USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  Therefore, providing examples for various tenses and grammatical structures is not applicable.  Using "about" would be the correct modern equivalent.

about to = 即将
how about = ...怎么样

be about = 关于
talk about = 谈论


注意事项:

Avoid using "abought" in modern writing or speech, as it will sound outdated and unusual. Use "about" instead.
