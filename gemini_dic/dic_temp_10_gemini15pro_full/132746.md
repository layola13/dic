注意事项:  The term "nondocumented" is often used as a more neutral alternative to "illegal immigrant," which some consider pejorative. However, both terms are contested and it's important to be mindful of the sensitivities involved when discussing this topic.  "Nondocumented's" is grammatically correct as a possessive, but it's very uncommon and sounds awkward. It's generally better to rephrase using "of the nondocumented person/immigrant."
