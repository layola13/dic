PHRASE-> (This word does not have common neutral phrases.  Its use in phrases often reinforces the offensive meaning.)
Due to the highly offensive nature of this word when used as a slur, providing phrases would be inappropriate and could contribute to the harmful use of the term.  It is strongly discouraged to use this word in any context other than referring to bundles of sticks or (in very specific UK dialects) a type of meatball.  Even then, caution and awareness of potential offense are crucial.
