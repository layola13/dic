ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *Chalcidius, from Greek *Χαλκίδιος (Khalkídios), from Χαλκίς (Khalkís, “Chalcis”), an ancient Greek city.  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂élḱis (“copper, bronze”).  The connection with metalworking may relate to early bronze tools used in the region.  The term "Chaldean" also refers to a group of people who lived in Babylonia and were known for their knowledge of astrology and astronomy.
