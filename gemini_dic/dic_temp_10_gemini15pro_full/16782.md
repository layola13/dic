Etymology:
basalt + -oid
basalt (n.) "dark, fine-grained volcanic rock," 1670s, from Late Latin basaltes, from Latin basanites "very hard stone," from Greek basanites (lithos) "touchstone, Lydian stone" (used to test gold), from basanos "touchstone," probably from Egyptian bhn "basalt," literally "black stone."
-oid (suffix) "resembling, like, having the form of," from Greek -eidos "form, shape," related to eidos "form, shape, appearance."
