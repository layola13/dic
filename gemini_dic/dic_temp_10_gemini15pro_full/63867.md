epihyal:/ˌɛpɪˈhaɪəl/
n.
舌骨上段; 舌骨
A small cartilage or bone attached to the ceratohyal, which is part of the hyoid apparatus in many vertebrates.
The epihyal is a small, bony or cartilaginous element located above the ceratohyal in the hyoid apparatus of some vertebrates. It plays a role in supporting the tongue and other structures involved in swallowing and vocalization.  It is often fused with the ceratohyal in mammals.
The epihyal bone in frogs helps support the tongue.
近义词:ceratohyal (sometimes)
反义词: (None - anatomical term)
词性: noun


Etymology:
From epi- + hyoid.  Epi- is a Greek prefix meaning "upon," "on," or "over." Hyoid refers to the U-shaped bone in the neck that supports the tongue.
