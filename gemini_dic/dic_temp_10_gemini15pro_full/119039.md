methylene:/ˈmɛθɪˌliːn/ | n. | 亚甲基 | A bivalent hydrocarbon radical, CH2, derived from methane by removal of two hydrogen atoms.  It forms a series by linking with itself, forming ethylene, propylene, etc. | Methylene chloride is a common solvent. 亚甲基二氯是一种常见的溶剂。 |  methyl radical, methanediyl | N/A | noun
词源: From French *méthylène*, from methyl + -ene. Ultimately from Ancient Greek μέθυ (méthu, “wine”) + ὕλη (húlē, “wood, matter”).
