albuminate:/ælˈbjuːmɪneɪt/
v.|使成白蛋白盐；与白蛋白化合|To combine with albumin; to convert into albuminate.|The process albuminates the proteins in the food.|近义词:combine, react|反义词:separate, decompose|词性:verb


ETYMOLOGY->
From albumen + -ate.  Albumen itself comes from Latin *albumen, meaning "white of egg."  The -ate suffix is used to form nouns denoting salts and esters of acids, or verbs meaning "to combine with."
