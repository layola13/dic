词源: From Middle English *furtheraunce, from Anglo-Norman, from Old French *fortier, from Vulgar Latin *fortiāre, from Latin fortis (“strong”).


注意事项:
"Furtherances" is less common than the singular form "furtherance."  It's mainly used when talking about multiple, distinct acts of furthering something.
