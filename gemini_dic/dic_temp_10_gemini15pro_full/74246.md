词源:
From Middle English *foxesglove (“foxglove”), equivalent to fox +‎ glove. Attested since c. 1398. Compare German Fuchshandschuh (“foxglove”), literally “fox’s hand-shoe”.  The "glove" part refers to the shape of the flowers.  The "fox" part's origin is uncertain, with theories ranging from a corruption of "folk's" (referring to fairies) to a reference to foxes' supposed use of the plant.
