注意事项:

"antirabieses" is not a standard English word. The correct term is usually "antirabies treatment" or "antirabies prophylaxis" if referring to the series of injections.  "Antirabies" is the more commonly used term, primarily as an adjective.  While grammatically "antirabieses" could be formed as a plural noun, it's highly unusual and not recommended.  This analysis focuses on the more common usage of "antirabies."
