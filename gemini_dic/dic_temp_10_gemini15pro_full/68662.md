ETYMOLOGY->
From Arabic "faddān" (فدان), a unit of land area, which itself derives ultimately from the Akkadian "imēru".  While related, the faram specifically refers to a unit of volume/weight, unlike the faddān.  Over time, and through various languages and regions, the term evolved and became associated specifically with dry goods like grain.  The precise amount a faram represents varied depending on the specific location and time period.
