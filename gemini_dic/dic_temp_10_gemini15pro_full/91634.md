PHRASE->
N/A  (Hyperbolas are typically used in a mathematical context and don't have common phrases associated with them in everyday language.  Phrases would be more likely to involve the adjective "hyperbolic," meaning exaggerated.)

词源：
From Late Latin hyperbola, from Ancient Greek ὑπερβολή (huperbolḗ, “excess, exaggeration, hyperbola”), from ὑπερβάλλω (huperbállō, “I throw over, I exceed”).
