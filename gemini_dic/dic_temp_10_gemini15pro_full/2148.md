ETYMOLOGY->
ADC stands for Analog-to-Digital Converter, Assistant Dental Clinician, or Attack Damage Carry (in gaming).  The acronym's meaning depends on the context.  Each individual term has its own etymology. "Analog" and "digital" have roots in Greek and Latin respectively, relating to measurement and numbers. "Assistant," "dental," and "clinician" are also derived from Latin and Greek, describing the helping role and medical context. "Attack," "damage," and "carry" have Germanic origins, related to offensive actions, harm, and support.
