nonconductivities:/ˌnɒnkɒndʌkˈtɪvɪtiz/
n.|非导电性；非传导性|The property of a material that prevents it from conducting heat, electricity, or sound.|The nonconductivities of these materials make them ideal insulators.|近义词: resistance, insulation|反义词: conductivity, conductance|名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + conductivity.  Conductivity comes from conduct + -ivity. Conduct derives from Latin *conductus*, past participle of *conducere* "to lead together," from *com-* "together" + *ducere* "to lead."  The suffix *-ivity* denotes a state or quality.
