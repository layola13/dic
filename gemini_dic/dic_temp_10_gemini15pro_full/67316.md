ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin ecstaticus, from Greek ekstatikos “beside oneself,” from ekstasis “displacement, trance,” from existanai “displace, put out of its place,” from ex- “out” + histanai “to cause to stand.”  The original sense referred to a state of trance, but the meaning shifted to intense joy.
