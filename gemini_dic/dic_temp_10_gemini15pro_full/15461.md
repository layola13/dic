词源:  "Baddies" is a slang term derived from "bad" with the suffix "-ie" which is often used to create diminutive or informal nouns.  "Bad" itself comes from Old English "bæddel" meaning "hermaphrodite, effeminate man."  The meaning evolved over time to "morally bad" and then to simply "bad" in the general sense.
