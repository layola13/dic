Etymology:
From the verb "mislead," which is formed by the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrong" or "badly") added to the verb "lead."  "Lead" in this context means "to guide or direct someone, often in a wrong direction or into a mistaken belief."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb "mislead" into a present participle, which can function as an adjective or a noun. When used as a noun,  it can be pluralized as "misleadings."
