ETYMOLOGY->
From French *cavalier* (noun), meaning "horseman, knight," ultimately from Late Latin *caballarius* "horseman," from *caballus* "horse." The sense of "disdainful" arose from the stereotypical image of a haughty nobleman on horseback.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "cavalier" into the noun "cavalierness," indicating the state or quality of being cavalier.
