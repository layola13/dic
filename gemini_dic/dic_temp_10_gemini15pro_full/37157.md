词源:
"Come" comes from Old English "cuman," meaning "to arrive, approach, come near."
"Terms" comes from Old French "termes," meaning "end, limit, boundary, term," ultimately from Latin "terminus," meaning "boundary, limit, end."

The phrase "come to terms" originally referred to reaching an agreement or settlement, often in a legal or financial context. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the idea of accepting or adapting to a difficult situation.
