diageotropism:/ˌdaɪəˌdʒiːoʊˈtrɒpɪzəm/
n.
横地性
The growth of a plant part at approximately right angles to the direction of gravity.
Example:  The lateral roots exhibit diageotropism, growing horizontally.  侧根表现出横地性，水平生长。

Example:  Diageotropism allows the rhizomes of ginger to spread horizontally underground.  横地性使生姜的根茎在地下水平蔓延。

近义词: plagiogeotropism
反义词: orthgeotropism
词性: noun


Etymology:
From dia- (Greek: "through, across") + geo- (Greek: "earth") + tropism (Greek: "a turning").
