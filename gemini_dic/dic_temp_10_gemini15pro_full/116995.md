词源:
This term likely originated from the name of Elijah McCoy (1844-1929), a Canadian-American inventor and engineer. He invented a lubricating cup that automatically oiled steam engines, significantly improving their efficiency.  His invention was so effective that people seeking genuine McCoy lubricators would insist they wanted "the real McCoy," not inferior imitations.  This led to the phrase becoming synonymous with authenticity and genuineness.
