jna:/ˈdʒeɪ ɛn eɪ/ | abbreviation | Java Native Access | Java Native Access (JNA) is a community-developed library that provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without using the Java Native Interface. JNA's design aims to provide native access in a natural way with a minimum of effort. No boilerplate or generated glue code is required. | Example: The project uses JNA to access system libraries.  这个项目使用JNA来访问系统库。 | 近义词: JNI (Java Native Interface) | 反义词:  N/A | n.
