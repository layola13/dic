注意事项:

*  "Curiousest" is grammatically correct, though archaic and non-standard.  It is formed regularly, following the rules of other two-syllable adjectives ending in -y (e.g., happy, happier, happiest). However, due to its infrequent use, it sounds awkward to modern speakers. "Most curious" is the preferred form in contemporary English.
