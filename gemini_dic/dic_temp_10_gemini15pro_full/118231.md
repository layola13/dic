mercator projection: /mərˈkeɪtər prəˈdʒɛkʃən/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | A cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.  | Example: Navigators relied heavily on Mercator projections for charting their courses. 航海家们非常依赖墨卡托投影来绘制他们的航线。

Example: The Mercator projection distorts the size of landmasses, especially near the poles. 墨卡托投影会扭曲陆地的面积，尤其是在两极附近。| 近义词: cylindrical projection 圆柱投影 | 反义词: (No direct antonym, but other map projections like the Gall-Peters or Robinson are often presented as alternatives)  | 词性: noun

mercator projections: /mərˈkeɪtər prəˈdʒɛkʃənz/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | Plural form of "Mercator projection".  | Example: Many classrooms still display Mercator projections of the world. 许多教室仍然展示世界的墨卡托投影。

Example:  Understanding the limitations of Mercator projections is crucial for accurate geographical interpretation. 理解墨卡托投影的局限性对于准确的地理解释至关重要。 | 近义词: cylindrical projections 圆柱投影 | 反义词: (No direct antonym, but other map projections are alternatives) | 词性: noun
