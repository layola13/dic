ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English dægesēage, literally “day’s eye,” because the flower opens in the morning and closes at night.  The word "daisy" comes from the Old English phrase "dægesēage," which translates to "day's eye." This name was given to the flower because it opens its petals in the morning and closes them at night, much like an eye.
