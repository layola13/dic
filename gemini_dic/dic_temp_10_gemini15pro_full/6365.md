amphibole:/ˈæmfɪboʊl/ (US), /ˈæmfɪbɒl/ (UK)| n. |角闪石|A group of inosilicate minerals, forming prism or needlelike crystals, containing iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and aluminum in various proportions.  They are common in metamorphic and igneous rocks.|Amphibole is a common mineral in many types of rocks.|近义词：inosilicate, mineral|反义词: None|词性: Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *amphibole*, from Ancient Greek ἀμφίβολος (amphíbolos, “ambiguous, doubtful”), from ἀμφί (amphí, “on both sides, around”) + βάλλω (bállo, “I throw, cast”).  This refers to the variable composition and appearance of the mineral group.
