cissoid:/ˈsɪsɔɪd/
n.
蔓叶线；蚌线
a curve with the equation y² (2a - x) = x³  where the diameter of the circle is 2a. This curve is generated by finding a point P on the diameter of a circle such that the distance from the end of the diameter to P is equal to the distance from a line tangent to the circle, at the other end of the diameter, to the circle itself.
The mathematician studied the properties of the cissoid.  这位数学家研究了蔓叶线的性质。
近义词: curve
反义词: (No direct antonym for a specific mathematical curve)
