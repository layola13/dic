microbenthos:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈbɛnθɒs/| n. |微型底栖生物|Benthic organisms, especially those that are too small to be caught by a standard bottom sampler and are less than 0.1mm in size. These organisms live on or in the seabed.|The study of microbenthos is crucial for understanding the nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.| 近义词: meiobenthos (sometimes used interchangeably, but meiobenthos typically refers to slightly larger organisms)| 反义词: macrobenthos| 词性: noun
