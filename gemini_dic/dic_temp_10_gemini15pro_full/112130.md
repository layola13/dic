词源:  The word "loo" is of uncertain origin. One theory suggests it comes from the French phrase "garde à l'eau!" (watch out for the water!), which was shouted from upstairs windows when emptying chamber pots. Another theory links it to the card game "lanterloo," where the losing player had to pay for drinks, possibly including trips to the toilet.
