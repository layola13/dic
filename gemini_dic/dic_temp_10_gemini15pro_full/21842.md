词源:
The origin of "bodge" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's related to the Middle French "bougette," meaning "leather bag," possibly referring to a poorly made bag. Another connects it to "botch," which might share a common Germanic root. The slang meaning of "temporary work" likely emerged in the 20th century.
