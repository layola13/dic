Etymology: From "detailed" (adjective, meaning showing attention to detail) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition). "Detailed" comes from the verb "detail" (meaning to list or describe item by item), which originated from Old French "detaillier" and ultimately from Latin "detaliare" (to cut into pieces).
