finary: /ˈfaɪnəri/ (This word is likely a misspelling or a neologism.  The closest standard word is "binary") |  n. (If interpreted as a noun derived from "binary") | 二进制的，二元的 |  Likely a misspelling of "binary," referring to a system of two parts or elements, typically represented as 0 and 1 in computing. | Example: The finary (assuming it's meant as binary) code underlies all computer operations.  二进制代码是所有计算机操作的基础。 | 近义词: dual, dichotomous | 反义词: multiple, diverse | 词性:  (Likely intended as a noun, but could be interpreted as an adjective)
