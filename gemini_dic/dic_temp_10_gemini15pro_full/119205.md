mhometer: /mhoʊˈmiːtər/ | n. | 姆欧计，电导计 | An instrument used to measure the conductance of a substance, particularly electrolytes.  It expresses the measurement in mhos (or siemens, the SI unit). | Example: The chemist used a mhometer to determine the conductivity of the solution. 化学家用姆欧计测定溶液的电导率。

Example: The mhometer indicated a high level of conductance in the sample. 姆欧计显示样品中的电导率很高。 | Synonym: conductivity meter, conductometer | Antonym: (No direct antonym, but a device measuring resistance could be considered a conceptual opposite - ohmmeter) | noun
