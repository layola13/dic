注意事项:
While grammatically correct, the plural form "acumens" is rare and often sounds unnatural. It is usually better to use "acumen" and rephrase the sentence.  For example, instead of "Their various acumens contributed to the project," use "Their various areas of acumen contributed to the project" or "Their combined acumen in different areas contributed to the project."
