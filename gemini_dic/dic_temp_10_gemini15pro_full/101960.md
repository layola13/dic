isobar:/ˈaɪsəbɑːr/ (US), /ˈaɪsəʊbɑːr/ (UK)
n.
等压线；同量素
A line on a map connecting points having the same atmospheric pressure. Also, in nuclear physics, each of two or more atoms or elements having the same atomic weights or mass numbers but different atomic numbers.
Isobars are commonly used in meteorology to show areas of equal pressure on weather maps. 等压线通常用于气象学中，在地图上显示气压相同的区域。
The two atoms are isobars of each other. 这两个原子互为同量素。
isoline, contour line
N/A
noun
