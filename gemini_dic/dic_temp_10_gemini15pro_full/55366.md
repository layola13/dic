ETYMOLOGY->
From distant + -ness + -es (plural suffix).  "Distant" comes from the Old French "distant" and ultimately from the Latin "distans," present participle of "distare" (to stand apart, be distant). The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  "-es" creates the plural form.
