PHRASE->
(Desiderate doesn't typically form strong idiomatic phrases. It's more formally used.)


词源：From Latin dēsīderātus, past participle of dēsīderāre (“to long for, desire, demand, require, miss, regret, complain of the absence of”).


注意事项:
Desiderate is a relatively formal and less common word compared to its synonyms like "desire" or "need." It often implies a strong sense of lacking something essential or desirable.
