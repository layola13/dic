PHRASE-> (Since "meeses" is nonstandard, phrases using it would also be nonstandard and rarely used.  It's best to avoid using "meeses" in formal writing or speech.)
There were a lot of meeses in the old house. 老房子里有很多老鼠。 (This is an example of a simple sentence using "meeses," but it's still nonstandard.)


NOTE: While grammatically functional, the word "meeses" is considered nonstandard and childish.  The correct plural of "mouse" is "mice."  Avoid using "meeses" in formal contexts.  This entire exercise is purely for demonstrating grammatical concepts and should not be taken as an endorsement of the word "meeses."
