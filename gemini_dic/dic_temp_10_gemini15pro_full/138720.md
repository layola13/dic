词源：From Old English _numen_ "taken, seized," past participle of _niman_ "to take, seize, catch," from Proto-Germanic _*neman_  (source also of Old Norse _nema_ "to take, learn," Old Frisian _nima_, Middle Dutch _nemen_, Old High German _neman_, German _nehmen_ "to take"), from PIE root _*nem-_ "to take, distribute." The sense development is from "taken, seized (as by illness or emotion)" to "benumbed, insensible," first recorded late 14c.  The transitive sense "to make numb" is from the 1520s.
