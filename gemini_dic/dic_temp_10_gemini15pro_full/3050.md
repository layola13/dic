ETYMOLOGY->
From aero- (air) + dynamic (of or relating to forces producing motion) + -ally (adverbial suffix).  "Aero" comes from the Greek "aer" (air). "Dynamic" comes from the Greek "dunamikos" (powerful).

USAGE->
The adverb "aerodynamically" is typically used to describe something designed or shaped to minimize air resistance or maximize airflow.  It's often used in contexts related to vehicles, aircraft, and sports equipment.

Simple sentence:
The car is aerodynamically sound. = 这辆车的空气动力学性能良好。
The plane was aerodynamically optimized for speed. = 这架飞机经过空气动力学优化以提高速度。


Complex sentence:
Because the bike is aerodynamically designed, it can achieve higher speeds. = 因为这辆自行车采用空气动力学设计，所以它可以达到更高的速度。
Although the car looked futuristic, it was not as aerodynamically efficient as expected.  = 尽管这辆车看起来很未来感，但它的空气动力学效率不如预期。


PHRASE->
aerodynamically designed = 空气动力学设计
aerodynamically efficient = 空气动力学效率高
aerodynamically optimized = 空气动力学优化
aerodynamically sound = 空气动力学性能良好
aerodynamically superior = 空气动力学性能优越
