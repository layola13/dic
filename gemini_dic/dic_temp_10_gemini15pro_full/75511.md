现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is writing data to the file using an fstream. = 程序正在使用fstream将数据写入文件。
The fstream is currently reading data from the disk. = fstream当前正在从磁盘读取数据。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The fstream has successfully opened the file. = fstream已成功打开文件。
The program has written all the data to the file using the fstream. = 程序已使用fstream将所有数据写入文件。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been writing data to the file using the fstream for the past hour. = 在过去的一个小时里，程序一直在使用fstream将数据写入文件。
The fstream has been reading data from the disk continuously. = fstream一直在连续地从磁盘读取数据。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The fstream opened the file without any errors. = fstream打开了文件，没有任何错误。
The program wrote the data to the file using the fstream. = 程序使用fstream将数据写入文件。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was writing data to the file using the fstream when the power went out. = 断电时，程序正在使用fstream将数据写入文件。
The fstream was reading data from the disk when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，fstream正在从磁盘读取数据。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The fstream had opened the file before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，fstream已经打开了文件。
The program had written all the data to the file using the fstream before it terminated. = 程序在终止之前，已经使用fstream将所有数据写入文件。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been writing data to the file using the fstream for several hours before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前的几个小时里，程序一直在使用fstream将数据写入文件。
The fstream had been reading data from the disk continuously for a long time. = fstream一直在连续地从磁盘读取数据很长时间了。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will use an fstream to write the results to a file. = 程序将使用fstream将结果写入文件。
The fstream will open the file in append mode. = fstream将以追加模式打开文件。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be writing data to the file using the fstream at midnight. = 程序将在午夜使用fstream将数据写入文件。
The fstream will be reading data from the network continuously. = fstream将持续从网络读取数据。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the program will have written all the data to the file using the fstream. = 到明天为止，程序将使用fstream将所有数据写入文件。
The fstream will have closed the file after writing the data. = fstream将在写入数据后关闭文件。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the end of the week, the program will have been writing data to the file using the fstream for seven days. = 到本周末，程序将已经使用fstream将数据写入文件七天了。
The fstream will have been reading data from the sensor continuously for a month. = fstream将已经连续从传感器读取数据一个月了。


PHRASE->
open an fstream = 打开一个fstream
close an fstream = 关闭一个fstream
read from an fstream = 从fstream读取
write to an fstream = 写入fstream
