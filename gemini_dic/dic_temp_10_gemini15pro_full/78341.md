ETYMOLOGY->
From Anglo-French gerund, Old French gerunde, and directly from Latin gerundum, gerundus, present participle of gerere "to carry, bear, manage, conduct, perform"

注意事项:  No direct antonyms exist for gerunds as they are a grammatical function.  Avoiding the "-ing" form and restructuring the sentence can express an opposite meaning, but there isn't a single word that serves as an antonym.
