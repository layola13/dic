PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases in English. It primarily stands alone as a term of address.)
It's more common to see phrases like "asking your mgogo for advice" or "visiting your mgogo's village".  Since it's a direct loanword, it doesn't integrate into English phrases the way native words do.
