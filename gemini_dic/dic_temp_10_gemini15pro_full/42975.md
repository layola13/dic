ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *cove, from Old Norse kofi (“hut, small chamber”), from Proto-Germanic *kubją (“vault, arched room”), from Proto-Indo-European *gewb- (“to bend, curve”).  The sense development from "chamber" to "small bay" likely occurred through the image of a bay as a sheltered, enclosed space.
