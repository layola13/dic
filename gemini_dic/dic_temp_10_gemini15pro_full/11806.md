词源:
From Middle English *errant* (meaning "wandering, vagrant"), from Old French *errant*, present participle of *errer* ("to wander, stray"), from Latin *iterāre* ("to repeat, go over again"), from *iter* ("journey, road"). The sense shifted from "wandering" to "notorious, infamous," and later to "thorough, complete."
