ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *cheater, from escheat (modern French échet), from Medieval Latin excadere "to fall out, lapse, decay", literally "to fall out of". Originally related to property confiscated to the crown. The sense shifted to "to deprive someone of something rightfully theirs". The modern sense of dishonesty in games emerged in the 16th century.
