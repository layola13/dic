ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *dēag, from Proto-Germanic *daujaną ("to dye, color"). Cognate with Old Norse deyja ("to die"), Old Frisian dēia ("to dye"), Middle Dutch dōyen ("to dye"), German tauen ("to thaw"). The semantic shift from "to dye" to "to die" likely occurred due to the association of death with the pallor or discoloration of the body.
