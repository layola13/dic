mesologarithm:/ˌmɛzoʊˈlɒɡərɪðəm/| n. | 中对数 |The mesologarithm of a number N is defined as log(log(N)), the logarithm of the logarithm of N.  It's used primarily in computational number theory. | The mesologarithm of 10000 is 2, since log(log(10000)) = log(4) ≈ 0.602, and then log(0.602) ≈ -0.22.  (Note:  This calculation uses base 10 logarithms.) |近义词: (No direct synonyms, but related to logarithm and double logarithm) |反义词: (None) |词性:noun
