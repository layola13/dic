词源： "Beat the rap" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early 20th century. "Rap" originally referred to a criminal charge or accusation, derived from the Irish word "rapt" meaning "abduction" or "arrest."  "Beat" retains its standard meaning of "to defeat" or "overcome." So, "beat the rap" literally means to defeat the charge.
