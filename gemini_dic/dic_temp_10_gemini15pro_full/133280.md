nonexpansion:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænʃən/ | n. |非扩张，非膨胀|A transformation or mapping that does not increase distances between points. In mathematical terms, a function f is a nonexpansion if for all x and y in its domain, the distance between f(x) and f(y) is less than or equal to the distance between x and y.  |The projection onto a convex set is a nonexpansion.  投影到凸集上是一个非扩张。|近义词: contraction (in some contexts) |反义词: expansion, dilation |词性: noun

nonexpansions:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænʃənz/ | n. |非扩张，非膨胀（复数）|Plural form of "nonexpansion," referring to multiple transformations or mappings that do not increase distances between points. |These nonexpansions preserve the structure of the metric space. 这些非扩张保留了度量空间的结构。|近义词: contractions (in some contexts) |反义词: expansions, dilations |词性: noun
