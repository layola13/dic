corniness's:/ˈkɔːrnɪnəsɪz/ |n.| 俗气，老套 |The corniness's of the dialogue made me cringe.  对话的俗气让我感到尴尬。| English explanation:  Corniness's is the noun form of "corny," meaning excessively sentimental, banal, or mawkish. The addition of "-ness" creates a noun referring to the quality or state of being corny. The apostrophe 's' indicates possession, although its use here is somewhat unusual and might be considered non-standard in some contexts.  It would be more common to simply say "the corniness of the dialogue." | Example: The movie's corniness's was its downfall. 这部电影的俗套是它的败笔。 | Synonyms: banality, triteness, sentimentality | Antonyms: originality, sophistication, subtlety | Noun
