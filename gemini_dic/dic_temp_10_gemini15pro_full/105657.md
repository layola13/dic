ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *cyninglēas, from cyning (“king”) +‎ -lēas (“-less”).  The plural form, "kinglessnesses," though grammatically correct, is extremely rare and generally considered awkward.  It's more natural to refer to multiple instances of "kinglessness" or use a different construction altogether.
