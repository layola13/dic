ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + praisable, from praise + -able.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of". "Praise" comes from the Old French "preiser" meaning "to prize, value". "-able" is a suffix meaning "capable of being". Therefore, "dispraisable" literally means "not capable of being praised".
