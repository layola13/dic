niobite:/ˈnaɪəˌbaɪt/| n. |铌铁矿|A black mineral consisting of iron niobate and tantalate, an ore of niobium.|Niobite is a valuable source of niobium. 铌铁矿是铌的重要来源。|Columbite, Tantalite| |noun
Etymology: From *niobium* + *-ite* (suffix forming names of minerals).  Niobium itself was named after Niobe, a figure in Greek mythology, due to its similarity to tantalum (named after Tantalus, Niobe's father).
