isosulphocyanate: /ˌaɪsoʊˌsʌlfoʊˈsaɪəneɪt/ /ˌaɪsəʊˌsʌlfəʊˈsaɪəneɪt/
noun
异硫氰酸酯
An organic compound containing the -N=C=S group.  These compounds are often pungent and some are important in the production of flavors and fragrances.  Some naturally occurring isosulphocyanates are thought to have health benefits.
Many vegetables of the Brassica family, such as broccoli and cabbage, contain glucosinolates which can be broken down into isosulphocyanates.
近义词: isothiocyanate (often used interchangeably)
反义词:  (No direct chemical antonym)
词性: n.

Etymology:
"iso-" (Greek: equal) + "sulpho-" (sulfur) + "cyanate" (a compound containing the -OCN group).  The name reflects the structural similarity to cyanates, although the chemical properties are distinct.
