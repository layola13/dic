"gazley" isn't a standard English word. It's a likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a rare dialectal term.  While grammatically correct in its construction, its usage might be misunderstood. Consider using more common synonyms like "staring," "fixed," "intent," or "piercing" for clearer communication.
