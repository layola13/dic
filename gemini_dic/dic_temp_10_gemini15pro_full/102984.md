jeene is not an English word. It is a Hindi/Urdu word.  Therefore, providing English etymological information or standard English usage examples across tenses isn't applicable.  I can, however, give examples of its usage *within* Hindi/Urdu sentences, translated to English.

Since "jeene" is an infinitive, future tenses are less directly applicable.  It's more natural to conjugate the verb for future contexts.  However, here are examples demonstrating the *concept* within Hindi/Urdu sentences:

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Main yahan jiyunga. = I will live here.
Voh vahan jiyenge. = They will live there.


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):  (Less common, but constructible)

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous): (Complex and less common)

Us waqt tak voh vahan panch salon se jee rahi hogi. = By that time, she will have been living there for five years.
