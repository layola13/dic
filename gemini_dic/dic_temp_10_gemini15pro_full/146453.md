overfrequency:/ˌoʊvərˈfriːkwənsi/| n.|过频，超频|The overfrequency of the signal caused interference. 信号过频导致干扰。|例句：The overfrequency relay tripped, shutting down the generator.  过频继电器跳闸，关闭了发电机。

例句：Overfrequency can damage electrical equipment. 过频会损坏电气设备。


近义词：excess frequency, high frequency|反义词: underfrequency, low frequency|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From "over-" (meaning "excessive," "above") + "frequency" (from Latin "frequentia" meaning "assembly," "crowd," "multitude"). The term refers to a frequency that is higher than the normal or expected range.
