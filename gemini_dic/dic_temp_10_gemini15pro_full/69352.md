federalnesses: /ˈfɛdərəlnɪsɪz/ | n. | 联邦性，联邦制特性（罕用）| The quality or state of being federal.  This word is rarely used and considered awkward.

A contrived example could be:  The varying federalnesses of different countries can lead to diverse outcomes. 各个国家的联邦性差异会导致不同的结果。 | 近义词: federalism, federal nature | 反义词: unitary system, centralized government | 词性: noun
