The word "deloul" does not appear to be a standard English word.  It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

If you can provide more context, like where you encountered this word or what you believe it might mean, I might be able to offer some suggestions.


However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage with the word "what," I can provide that information:
