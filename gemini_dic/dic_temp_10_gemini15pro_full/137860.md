PHRASE->

This phrase is generally not used in common collocations. The term itself can be sensitive and is typically used directly rather than within phrases.  It’s more common to see discussions around the topic rather than using set phrases.  For example, discussing “the stigma of being nonvirgin” or “attitudes towards nonvirginity.”  Using the word in isolation is often the most straightforward way to convey its meaning.
