PHRASE->
(Generally, "former's" doesn't form common phrases. It's grammatically correct but less common in everyday speech compared to using "the former" followed by a noun.)

注意事项:
"Former's" is less common than "the former" + noun.  It's generally only used when the noun is implied and clear from the context.  For instance, if you're discussing two presidents, you might say "the former's policies," but it would be more natural to say "the former president's policies."
