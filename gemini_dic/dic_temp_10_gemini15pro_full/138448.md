| n. |新星|Plural of nova. A nova is a star that suddenly becomes much brighter and then gradually returns to its original brightness over a period of weeks to years. |例句：Astronomers observed several novae in that galaxy last year. 去年天文学家在那个星系观测到了几颗新星。

例句：The novae were visible even with small telescopes. 这些新星即使使用小型望远镜也能看到。|近义词：supernovae (more powerful explosions) |反义词: None (there isn't a direct opposite of a stellar explosion)|词性: Noun (plural)
