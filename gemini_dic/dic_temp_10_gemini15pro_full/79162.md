ETYMOLOGY->
From Scottish *glamour*,  a variant of *grammar*.  Originally, in the sense of "magic, enchantment," specifically the supposed influence exerted by a magic spell.  This sense arose from the association of scholarship, especially in the Middle Ages, with occult practices. The modern sense of "alluring charm" developed later.
