词源:
The origin of "the bee's knees" is uncertain. It emerged in the 1920s as part of a trend of nonsensical animal-related slang phrases, like "the cat's pajamas" and "the snake's hips."  These phrases were used to express approval or admiration for something considered excellent or fashionable.  While there are theories involving the close-packed pollen sacs on a bee's legs, these are largely speculative, and the expression likely arose simply as playful, rhyming slang.
