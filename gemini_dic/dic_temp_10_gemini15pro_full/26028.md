词源:  "bushed" likely originates from the idea of being lost and exhausted in the bush (wild, uncleared land), common in Australia, South Africa and other regions.  "Bush" in this sense refers to sparsely populated, wooded areas.  The experience of being lost and disoriented in such terrain leads to exhaustion, hence the association with tiredness.
