词源：From Middle English *carpen, from Old North French *carper (“to speak, chat, tell stories”), from Frankish *karpōn, from Proto-Germanic *karpōną (“to boast, lament”).  Cognate with Old High German kerfan. More at harp.  Originally meant to speak, talk, or tell stories; the sense of complaining developed later.
