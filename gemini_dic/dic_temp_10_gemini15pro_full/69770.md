ETYMOLOGY->
From French *fermate*, from Italian *fermata*, literally "stopped," feminine past participle of *fermare* "to stop," from Late Latin *firmare* "to strengthen, make firm, fix," from Latin *firmus* "firm, strong, steadfast."  The mathematical usage refers to Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665), a French lawyer and amateur mathematician.
