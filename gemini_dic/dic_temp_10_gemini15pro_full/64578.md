ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *erst*, from Old English *ǣrest* ("first, at first, firstly, for the first time, once"), from Proto-Germanic *airistaz* ("earliest"), superlative of *air* ("early"). Cognate with Old Frisian *ērest* (“first”), Old Saxon *ērist* (“first”), Old High German *ēristo* (“first”), Gothic *𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌹𐍃𐍄𐌰* (airista, “first”). Related also to ere.  More at ere. The sense shifted from "first" to "previously" in Middle English.
