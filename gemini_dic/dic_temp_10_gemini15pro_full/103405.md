词源: "Jinxing" is a direct transliteration from Chinese 进行 (jìnxíng), meaning "to carry out" or "to conduct". It doesn't have its own etymology in English but borrows its meaning from the Chinese verb.  While occasionally used in English texts relating to Chinese contexts, it's not a common or standard English word.  Using more established English equivalents like "implementing," "conducting," or "carrying out" is generally recommended for clarity.
