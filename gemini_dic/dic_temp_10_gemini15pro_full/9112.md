Etymology:
From anti- + monopolization.  "Anti-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposed to." "Monopolization" comes from "monopolize," which in turn derives from "monopoly."  "Monopoly" has its roots in the Greek words "monos" (alone, single) and "polein" (to sell). Thus, the word literally refers to the action of being the sole seller.
