fissility:/fɪˈsɪləti/
n.|裂变性，分裂性|The fissility of uranium is what makes it useful in nuclear reactors. 铀的裂变性使其可用于核反应堆。|例句：The fissility of the material makes it dangerous to handle. 这种材料的裂变性使其处理起来很危险。

例句：The high fissility of plutonium-239 makes it a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. 钚-239的高裂变性使其成为核武器的关键成分。

近义词：divisibility, cleavability
反义词：infissility, stability
词性：noun

Etymology: From Latin *fissilis* (“able to be split or cleft”), from findō (“split, cleave”).  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bhid- (“to split, cleave”).
