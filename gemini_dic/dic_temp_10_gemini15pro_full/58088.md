词源:
This term is a compound word formed from "droopy" (meaning hanging down limply) and "drawers" (an older term for trousers or underwear).  The "droopy" part emphasizes the sagging nature of the pants, while "drawers" refers to the garment itself.  The term likely originated in informal language to describe a particular style of dress.
