myelin: /ˈmaɪəlɪn/ | n. | 髓磷脂;髓鞘 | A white fatty substance that forms a medullary sheath around the axis cylinder of some nerve fibers, increasing the speed at which impulses are conducted. |  The myelin sheath protects the nerve and helps it conduct signals more efficiently. 髓鞘保护神经并帮助它更有效地传导信号。| synonyms: medullary sheath | antonyms: None | noun

myelin sheath: /ˈmaɪəlɪn ʃiːθ/ | n. | 髓鞘 | The insulating layer of myelin that surrounds the core of a nerve fiber or axon and facilitates the transmission of nerve impulses. | Damage to the myelin sheath can cause neurological problems.  髓鞘的损伤会导致神经系统问题。 | synonyms: medullary sheath | antonyms: None | noun

myelinated: /ˈmaɪəlɪˌneɪtɪd/ | adj. | 有髓鞘的 | Covered with myelin. | Myelinated nerve fibers transmit signals faster than unmyelinated ones. 有髓鞘的神经纤维比无髓鞘的神经纤维传递信号更快。 | synonyms: medullated | antonyms: unmyelinated | adjective
