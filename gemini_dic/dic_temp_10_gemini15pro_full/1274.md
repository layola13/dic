ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "accost" (to approach and speak to, often boldly or aggressively) + "-able" (suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of being").  "Accost" itself comes from the Old French "acoster" (to come alongside), ultimately from the Latin "ad-" (to) + "costa" (rib, side).  The sense shifted from a literal coming alongside (as of ships) to approaching a person.
