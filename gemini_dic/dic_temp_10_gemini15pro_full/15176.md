The word "backare" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling of "backer," possibly "baccarat," or perhaps intended as two words like "back are."  I'll provide information for "backer" and "baccarat," and address the possibility of "back are."

**1. Backer:**

/ˈbækər/ | n. | 支持者；赞助者 |  Someone who supports a person, plan, or idea, especially by giving them money. | Example: The project has several wealthy backers.  这个项目有几个有钱的支持者。

| Example:  She was a strong backer of women's rights. 她是一位坚定的女权支持者。

| 近义词: supporter, patron, sponsor | 反义词: opponent, detractor | 词性: noun


**2. Baccarat:**

/ˈbækəˌrɑː/ (US), /ˈbækəˌrɑːt/ (UK) | n. | 百家乐（一种纸牌赌博游戏）| A gambling card game in which players bet on which of two hands, the player's or the banker's, will be closest to a total of nine.  | Example:  He lost a fortune playing baccarat in Monte Carlo. 他在蒙特卡洛玩百家乐输了一大笔钱。

| Example: Baccarat is a popular game in high-stakes casinos.  百家乐是高赌注赌场里很受欢迎的游戏。

| 近义词: (No direct synonym, as it's a specific game)  Perhaps "card game," "gambling game" | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun


**3. Back are:**

This is not a single word but likely represents two words used together.  "Back" can function as an adverb, adjective, noun, or verb, while "are" is a verb.  The meaning depends entirely on context.  Here's a possible interpretation:

back /bæk/ | adv. | 回原处；向后 | To or toward the rear. | Example:  Please step back from the edge. 请从边缘后退。

| Example: He went back home after the party.  派对结束后他回家了。

| 近义词: backwards, behind | 反义词: forward, ahead | 词性: adverb (in this context)


are /ɑːr/ (US), /ɑː(r)/ (UK)| v. | 是（be动词的复数现在时） |  The present tense plural form of the verb "to be." |  Example: They are happy to be here.  他们很高兴来到这里。

| Example:  We are going to the cinema tonight. 我们今晚要去看电影。

| 近义词: (Part of the verb "to be," no direct synonyms) | 反义词: (Relates to existence, no direct antonym) | 词性: verb
