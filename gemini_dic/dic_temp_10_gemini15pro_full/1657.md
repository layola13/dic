ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *knowlechen*  (verb) "to admit the truth of (something), recognize, admit, concede, grant, confess" from Old French *conoistre* "to know, recognize" (Modern French *connaître*), from Latin *cognōscere*  "get to know," from *co-*, here probably an intensive prefix, + *gnōscere* "to know."  The prefix *ac-* (from Latin *ad-*) acts as an intensifier.  The suffix *-ment* forms nouns denoting an action or resulting state.


USAGE->

PHRASE->

acknowledgements page = 致谢页
letter of acknowledgement = 感谢信
formal acknowledgements = 正式致谢
with acknowledgements to = 感谢


注意事项:
* "Acknowledgement" is also a valid singular form, but "acknowledgements" is more commonly used when referring to a section in a book or a formal expression of gratitude to multiple people.
* While acknowledgements typically express gratitude, they can also simply confirm receipt or awareness of something.
