ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *awarden*, from Anglo-Norman *awarder*, from Old French *eswarder* "to judge, decide, fix, assign," from Frankish *(e)swardōn*, from Proto-Germanic *swara- "judgment, decision," from Proto-Indo-European *swēr- "to speak solemnly, take an oath."  The meaning shifted from "to judge, decide" to "to give something as a result of a judgment or decision," hence "to give as a reward."
