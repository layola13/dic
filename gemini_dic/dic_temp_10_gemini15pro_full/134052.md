PHRASE->
(No common phrases exist using "nonidiomatically" specifically.  It's typically used on its own to describe language use.)


词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "idiomatic" + "-ally" (adverb suffix).  "Idiomatic" comes from "idiom," which ultimately derives from the Greek "idios" (meaning "one's own, personal, private").
