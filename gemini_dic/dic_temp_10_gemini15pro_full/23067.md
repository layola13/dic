PHRASE->
(This phrase doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way other words do.  It describes a state of being deeply involved, so it's more naturally used within a sentence.)


注意事项:  The phrase "bound up in" is not commonly used in the continuous tenses, particularly the perfect continuous tenses.  While grammatically correct, they sound awkward and are rarely used in natural speech or writing.  The simple tenses are much more common and natural-sounding.
