ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *adden*, from Old English *ādian* (“to get, obtain, acquire”), of uncertain origin. Perhaps related to Old English *ēað* (“easy, comfortable, prosperous, rich”). Cognate with Old Frisian *āda*, Old Saxon *ādian*, Middle Dutch *oeden*, *oeten* (“to obtain, receive”), German *ade* (“obtained land”).  The meaning shifted from “obtain” to “add” likely through the sense of acquiring something and thus adding it to one's possessions.
