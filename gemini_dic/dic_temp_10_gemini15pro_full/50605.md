dereference:/diːˈrɛfərəns/| v. |解引用|To access the value stored at a memory location pointed to by a pointer.|The program dereferenced the pointer to access the data.|近义词: access, retrieve|反义词: assign, store|词性:动词
词源:  de- (prefix meaning "remove" or "reverse") + reference (referring to a pointer's act of pointing to a memory location).  The act of dereferencing removes the indirection of the pointer and accesses the value directly.


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The code dereferences the pointer to get the value. = 代码解引用指针以获取值。
He dereferences the null pointer, causing a crash. = 他解引用了空指针，导致程序崩溃。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is dereferencing the pointer to read the data. = 程序正在解引用指针以读取数据。
She is dereferencing the pointer in the loop. = 她在循环中解引用指针。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The function has dereferenced the pointer several times. = 函数已经多次解引用了该指针。
We have dereferenced the pointer to modify the data. = 我们已经解引用指针来修改数据。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been dereferencing the pointer continuously. = 程序一直在连续解引用指针。
He has been dereferencing the pointer for a while now. = 他已经解引用该指针一段时间了。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The code dereferenced the pointer and retrieved the value. = 代码解引用了指针并检索了值。
The function dereferenced the invalid pointer and crashed. = 函数解引用了无效指针并崩溃了。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was dereferencing the pointer when the error occurred. = 当错误发生时，程序正在解引用指针。
She was dereferencing the pointer to access the array element. = 她正在解引用指针以访问数组元素。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The code had dereferenced the pointer before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，代码已经解引用了指针。
The function had dereferenced the null pointer, causing the crash. = 函数已经解引用了空指针，导致了崩溃。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been dereferencing the pointer for hours before the crash. = 在崩溃之前，程序已经解引用该指针数小时了。
He had been dereferencing the pointer repeatedly before he found the bug. = 在他发现错误之前，他一直在重复解引用指针。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The code will dereference the pointer to get the updated value. = 代码将解引用指针以获取更新的值。
The function will dereference the pointer after checking for null. = 函数将在检查空值后解引用指针。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be dereferencing the pointer at that time. = 程序将在那个时间点解引用指针。
She will be dereferencing the pointer to access the next element. = 她将解引用指针以访问下一个元素。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The program will have dereferenced the pointer by the time the function returns. = 在函数返回时，程序将已经解引用了指针。
He will have dereferenced the pointer multiple times before the loop finishes. = 在循环结束之前，他将已经多次解引用了指针。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The program will have been dereferencing the pointer for a long time by the end of the process. = 到进程结束时，程序将已经解引用该指针很长时间了。
She will have been dereferencing the pointer continuously to process the data stream. = 她将一直在连续解引用指针来处理数据流。



PHRASE->
dereference a pointer = 解引用指针
dereference the address = 解引用地址
dereference a null pointer = 解引用空指针 (often leads to errors)
dereference operator * = 解引用运算符 *
double dereference = 双重解引用 (dereferencing a pointer to a pointer)
