floscularian:/flɒsˈkjuːlə.ri.ən/
n.
floscularian, rotifer
A microscopic aquatic animal of the class Rotifera, characterized by a ciliated corona that resembles a rotating wheel.
Floscularians are sessile, meaning they attach themselves to a substrate. They build protective tubes from debris and secreted materials.
Floscularians are fascinating creatures to observe under a microscope.
