nouthe: /ˈnuːθ/ | n. |  现在 | present; now | The nouthe is always changing. | 近义词: present, now | 反义词: past, future | 词性:名词

英文解析:  "Nouthe" is an archaic word meaning "now" or "at the present time." It is rarely used in modern English. It comes from Middle English "nouthe," from Old English "nu þa," where "nu" means "now" and "þa" is a demonstrative adverb meaning "then."  Over time, "þa" lost its distinct meaning and became fused with "nu" to form "nouthe."
