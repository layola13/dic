词源:

"Non-" is a Latin prefix meaning "not."

"Kaffir" derives from the Arabic word "kāfir," meaning "unbeliever" or "infidel."  It was historically used by Arab traders in East Africa to refer to non-Muslims, specifically Bantu-speaking peoples.  Later, it was adopted by European colonizers, particularly in South Africa, where it became a deeply offensive and dehumanizing slur directed at Black Africans.
