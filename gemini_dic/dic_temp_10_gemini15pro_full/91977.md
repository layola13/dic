词源： "hyper-" (prefix meaning "over, beyond") + "mystical" (adjective meaning "spiritually significant; inspiring a sense of awe and wonder") + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns from adjectives).  "Hyper-" comes from Greek "hyper" (over, above).  "Mystical" comes from Late Latin "mysticus", from Greek "mystikos" (of secret rites), from "mystes" (initiate). "-ness" is a native English suffix.
