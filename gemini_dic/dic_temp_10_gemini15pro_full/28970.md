词源: "Carry-on" originates from the verb phrase "carry on," meaning to continue or proceed.  As a noun referring to luggage, it's a shortened form of "carry-on baggage," referring to items passengers can carry onto a vehicle. The possessive form "carryon's" is less common and generally considered informal or grammatically incorrect.  It's better to use "carry-ons" for the plural or rephrase using "of" (e.g., "the weight of the carry-on").
