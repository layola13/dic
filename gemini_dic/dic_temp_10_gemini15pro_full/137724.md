nonvacuums:/nɒnˈvækjuːmz/
n.|非真空; 充满物质的空间|Areas where matter exists, the opposite of vacuums.|These nonvacuums contain various gases and particles.|近义词: plena, filled spaces|反义词: vacuums|词性: 名词

nonvacuum:/nɒnˈvækjuːm/
n.|非真空; 充满物质的空间|An area where matter exists, the opposite of a vacuum.|This nonvacuum contains air and dust.|近义词: plenum, filled space|反义词: vacuum|词性: 名词

词源:  "Non-" is a Latin prefix meaning "not" or "without." "Vacuum" comes from the Latin "vacuus," meaning "empty."  Therefore, "nonvacuum" literally means "not empty."
