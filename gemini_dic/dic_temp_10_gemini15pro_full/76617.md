词源:
From French *galonner*, from *galon* "braid," perhaps from Old French *gale* "throat, gullet," from Frankish *walgan* "swallow," related to Old High German *walkan* "to roll, toss," literally "to swallow," from PIE root *wel- (3)* "to turn, wind, roll."  The notion is of the braid being wrapped around something.
