PHRASE->
(Inhere is not typically used in common phrases.  It's more formal and academic.)

注意事项:  "Inhere" is an intransitive verb, meaning it doesn't take a direct object.  You can say "justice inheres in society," but not "society inheres justice." You can use prepositions like "in" or "within" to show where something inheres.
