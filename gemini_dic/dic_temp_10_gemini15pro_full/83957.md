half-conservatively:/ˌhæf kənˈsɜːrvətɪvli/ | adv. | 半保留地 | In DNA replication, each new double helix is created with one strand from the original molecule and one new strand. This process is described as half-conservative. | DNA replication is half-conservative, meaning that each daughter DNA molecule receives one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.  DNA复制是半保留的，这意味着每个子DNA分子都接收一条亲本链和一条新合成的链。|  The genetic material is replicated half-conservatively. 遗传物质以半保留的方式复制。 | semi-conservatively |  fully-conservatively/dispersively | adverb
