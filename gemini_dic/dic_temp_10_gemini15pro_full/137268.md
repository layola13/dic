nonsymmetries:/nɒnˈsɪmətriz/
|n.|不对称，非对称性|The lack of symmetry; the absence of or the opposite of symmetry.  The condition of not being symmetrical.|The painting deliberately emphasized the nonsymmetries of the human face.|近义词：asymmetry, imbalance, disproportion, unevenness|反义词：symmetry, balance, proportion, evenness|词性: 名词

Etymology:
non- (prefix) + symmetry + -ies (plural suffix)

"non-"  Latin origin, meaning "not."
"symmetry"  from Late Latin *symmetria, from Greek summetria "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, regularity," from summetros "commensurable, having a common measure, symmetrical," from syn- "together" + metron "measure."
"-ies" plural suffix.
