alleles:/əˈliːlz/| n.|等位基因|One of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.|Example 1: The different alleles for eye color can result in blue, brown, or green eyes. 不同的眼睛颜色等位基因会导致蓝色、棕色或绿色的眼睛。

Example 2:  Scientists are studying the different alleles associated with increased risk of certain diseases. 科学家正在研究与某些疾病风险增加相关的不同等位基因。|Synonym: gene variant, alternative form of a gene|Antonym: N/A (Alleles don't have direct opposites; the concept is about variation within a gene.)|Noun
