nonfrequences:/nɒnˈfriːkwənsiz/ | n. | 非频率，非常见频率 |  This term refers to occurrences or values that do not appear often or regularly in a dataset or signal. It often implies a deviation from the norm or expected pattern of frequencies.  It's constructed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "frequencies". | The analysis revealed several nonfrequences in the audio signal, suggesting the presence of unusual sounds.  分析揭示了音频信号中的几个非常见频率，表明存在异常声音。 | Near synonyms:  infrequencies, rarities, anomalies | Antonyms:  frequencies, commonalities | noun
