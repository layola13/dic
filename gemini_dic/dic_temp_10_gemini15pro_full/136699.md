nonsegmented:/ˌnɒnˈsɛɡmɛntɪd/ | adj. | 非分段的，不分节的 | Not divided into segments or sections; continuous. | The earthworm has a nonsegmented body. 蚯蚓有一个不分节的身体。| The virus has a nonsegmented genome. 这种病毒的基因组是不分段的。| 近义词：continuous, whole, undivided | 反义词: segmented, divided | 词性: 形容词

Etymology:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "segmented" (from Latin "segmentum," meaning "a piece cut off"). "Non-" 表否定，"segmented" 源自拉丁语 "segmentum"，意为“切掉的一块”。
