词源:

"Overintellectualize" is derived from "over-" (meaning "excessive") + "intellectualize" (meaning "to treat or regard in an intellectual manner").  "Intellectualize" itself comes from "intellect" (from Latin "intellectus," meaning "understanding, perception") + "-ize" (a suffix forming verbs meaning "to make or become").  The final "-ations" is a suffix indicating the plural form of a noun of action or process.
