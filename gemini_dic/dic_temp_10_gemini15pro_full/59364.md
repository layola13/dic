ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *ernest* "seriousness, zeal," from Old English *eornost* "seriousness, zeal, strife," of uncertain origin.  Possibly related to Old High German *ernust* "battle, seriousness," or perhaps from Proto-Germanic *er-no-/* "against-man," suggesting a sense of "serious opposition."
