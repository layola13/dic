注意事项:
The word "ginners" is derived from "gin," which originally referred to a machine or engine. The term "cotton gin" specifically refers to the machine used to separate cotton fibers from their seeds.  The "-ers" suffix denotes the people who operate these machines.  Therefore, "ginners" refers specifically to the workers who operate cotton gins.
