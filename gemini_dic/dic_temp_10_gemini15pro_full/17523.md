ETYMOLOGY->
This idiom originates from hunting.  Beaters would literally beat bushes and undergrowth to flush out game birds for the hunters.  The act of beating the bush without actually confronting the game became a metaphor for avoiding the main issue.  这个习语起源于狩猎。 驱赶者会真的拍打灌木丛和矮树丛，以便猎人捕猎野禽。 拍打灌木丛而不实际面对猎物的行为成了避免主要问题的隐喻。
