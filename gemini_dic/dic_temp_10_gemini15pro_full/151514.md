parrying:/ˈpæriɪŋ/| n. |招架，挡开|The swordsman's parrying was swift and precise. |The boxer's parrying of the blow saved him from a knockout. |近义词:blocking, deflecting, warding off|反义词:accepting, receiving|noun

词源: From Middle French *parer*, from Old French *parier*, from Latin *parare* "to prepare, provide, procure, make ready, arrange, order; furnish, equip; get, obtain," from PIE root *pere- (1) "to produce, procure."  The sense development from "prepare" to "ward off a blow" is perhaps via the notion of "preparing (oneself, one's weapon) to meet an attack."
