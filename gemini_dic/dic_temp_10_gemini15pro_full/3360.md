词源:  From the verb "friend" + the suffix "-ed" forming the past participle, but often used adjectivally. "Friend" itself comes from Old English "frēond," meaning "friend, lover, relative," related to Old Frisian "friond," Old Saxon "friund," Old High German "friunt," Old Norse "frændi," Gothic "frijonds," all from a Germanic base meaning "to love." The suffix "-ed" is commonly used to form the past participle and past tense of verbs, but can also form adjectives.
