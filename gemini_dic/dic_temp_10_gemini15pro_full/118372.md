The word "meritot" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you intended a different word, please provide it.

However, I can still explain the requested grammatical points using the word "what" as you demonstrated in your prompt.
