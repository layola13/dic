注意事项:

*  "habit's" itself isn't a standard English word.  It could be a typo for "habit's" meaning "habit is" or "habit has," or it could be a possessive form, although unusual to use "habit's" in this way.  This analysis focuses on "habit" as a noun and its possessive form, "habit's," which would be used to indicate that something belongs to a habit (e.g., "The habit's power was undeniable.").  The possessive form is less common than the noun form on its own.
* The provided etymology traces the word back to its Latin and Old French origins.
*  The usage examples demonstrate the word in various tenses and contexts.
*  The phrases provided are common collocations with "habit."
