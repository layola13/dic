词源：
From Latin *desultorius* "of a vaulter, leaping," from *desultor* "a circus rider who jumps from one horse to another," from *desilire* "to leap down," from *de-* "down" + *salire* "to leap."  The sense evolution is from "leaping from one thing to another" to "irregular, disconnected."  来自拉丁语 *desultorius* “跳马者的”，源自 *desultor* “在马戏团中从一匹马跳到另一匹马上的骑手”，源自 *desilire* “跳下”，来自 *de-* “向下” + *salire* “跳跃”。  词义演变是从“从一件事跳到另一件事”到“不规则的，不连贯的”。
