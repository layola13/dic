ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "act" (meaning to behave or perform) and the adjective "funny" (meaning strange or unusual in this context).  "Act" comes from the Latin "actus" (a doing, a driving). "Funny" has a more complex etymology, ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic. Its meaning has evolved over time from "foolish, silly" to also encompass "strange" or "peculiar."
