gastrulation: /ˌɡæstrəˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 原肠胚形成 | The process in embryonic development during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a trilaminar ("three-layered") structure known as the gastrula.  This creates the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. | Gastrulation is a crucial stage in vertebrate development. 原肠胚形成是脊椎动物发育的关键阶段。 |  embryogenesis, cell differentiation |  N/A | noun

Etymology:  From  Greek *gaster* (γαστήρ) "belly, stomach" + -ulation.
