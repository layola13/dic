Etymology:
From "creature" + "-liness" (a suffix forming abstract nouns denoting a state or quality). "Creature" comes from Old French "creature" (Modern French "créature"), from Latin "creatura" "thing created," from "creare" "to create."


注意事项:  creaturelinesses is a rarely used plural form of "creatureliness".  It emphasizes multiple instances or aspects of the quality of being a creature.  It is far more common to use the singular form.
