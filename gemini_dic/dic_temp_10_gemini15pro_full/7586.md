/əˈnaʊns fɔːr/ | phrasal verb (not a standard phrase - see explanation below) | 为...宣布 | To make a public declaration regarding something intended for a specific person, group, or purpose (This construction is less common than “announce something for someone/something”) |  "The mayor will announce the new park plans for the city tomorrow." 市长将于明天公布城市新的公园计划。 | synonyms: declare for, proclaim for | antonyms: conceal from, withhold from | phrasal verb


USAGE-> "Announce for" isn't a standard phrasal verb.  It's more common to use "announce" followed by the thing being announced and then "for" to indicate the beneficiary or purpose.  It's best to think of these as separate words working together rather than a fixed phrase.  However, for illustrative purposes, using the structure "announce something for someone/something", we can apply it to different tenses.

PHRASE-> (These relate to the word "what", not "announce for")

What the hell! = 搞什么鬼！
what if = 如果...会怎么样
what for = 为了什么
no matter what = 无论如何

注意事项:  As noted above, "announce for" is not a standard phrasal verb in English. It's more natural to use "announce something for someone/something".
