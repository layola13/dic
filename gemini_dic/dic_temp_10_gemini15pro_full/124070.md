morphophyly:/ˌmɔːrfəˈfaɪli/ | n. | 形态谱系 | The study of the evolutionary relationships among organisms based on morphological characters, often without regard to genealogical relationships.  It focuses on overall similarity in form, regardless of whether those similarities arose through common ancestry or convergent evolution. | Example: Morphophyly can be useful in classifying organisms when genetic data is unavailable, but it can also lead to misclassifications if convergent evolution has occurred. 形态谱系在基因数据不可用时对生物分类很有用，但如果发生了趋同进化，它也可能导致错误分类。

Example:  The morphophyly of succulent plants in arid environments reflects adaptations to water scarcity, even though these plants may not be closely related.  干旱环境中肉质植物的形态谱系反映了对缺水的适应，即使这些植物可能没有密切的亲缘关系。 | Near synonyms: phenetics, numerical taxonomy | Antonyms: phylogeny, cladistics | Noun
