beleave:/bɪˈliːv/ | v. | 相信，认为 | To accept something as true; to have confidence in the truth or existence of something. |  I beleave it will rain tomorrow. 我相信明天下雨。| 近义词：believe, think, suppose | 反义词：disbelieve, doubt | verb

词源：This word appears to be a misspelling of "believe." It likely arises from confusion with similar-sounding words or simple typographical error. The word "believe" comes from Middle English *bileven*, from Old English *belīefan* (“believe, trust”), from *geliefan* (“believe”).
