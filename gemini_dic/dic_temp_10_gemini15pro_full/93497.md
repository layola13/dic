词源：
"Illywhacker" is Australian slang, popularized by Peter Carey's novel of the same name.  Its precise origin is uncertain, but it's believed to be derived from "whacker," meaning something exceptional or impressive, combined with "illy," possibly a shortening of "illegal" or suggesting something shady or deceptive.  Therefore, an "illywhacker" is someone who tells impressive but ultimately false or deceptive stories.
