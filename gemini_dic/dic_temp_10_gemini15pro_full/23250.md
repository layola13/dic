词源:
From Middle English *bownen, from Old Norse *búinn (past participle of búa “to dwell, to prepare, to till”), from Proto-Germanic *būaną (“to dwell, to build”).  Cognate with Danish bo (“to dwell”), Swedish bo (“to dwell”), Icelandic búa (“to live, to dwell, to prepare”).  The meaning shifted from “prepared” to “having a natural inclination or talent.”
