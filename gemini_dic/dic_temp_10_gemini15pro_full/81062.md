Etymology:
From "grainedness" + possessive suffix "-'s". "Grainedness" is derived from "grained" + "-ness". "Grained" comes from "grain" (referring to a small, hard particle) + "-ed" (past participle suffix).  Ultimately, "grain" traces back to Proto-Germanic *granam and Proto-Indo-European *ǵr̥h₂nóm.
