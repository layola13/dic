PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in set phrases.  Its formal and somewhat archaic nature makes fixed phrases uncommon.  Therefore, instead of phrases,  I'll offer sentences demonstrating typical usage with prepositions.)

词源:
From Old English *betæcan* "to entrust, commit," from *be-* "about, around" + *tæcan* "to teach, show." The sense shifted to "to commit oneself to a course of action" and then to "to go to, resort to."
