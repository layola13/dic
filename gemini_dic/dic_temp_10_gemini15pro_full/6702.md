anallagmatic:/ˌænəlæɡˈmætɪk/
adjective
变换的，对易的，自反的
Relating to or involving an operation which, when performed twice, yields the original value or state; reciprocal.  Specifically used in mathematics, particularly in group theory, where an anallagmatic curve remains unchanged by a certain type of transformation.  More generally, it can describe anything that returns to its original state after a double application of a process.
The anallagmatic curve remained unchanged after the inversion.  这条自反曲线在反演之后保持不变。
Synonyms: reciprocal, invertible, self-inverse, involutive
Antonyms: non-invertible, non-reciprocal
词性: adjective
