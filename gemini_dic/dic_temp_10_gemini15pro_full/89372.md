注意事项:

*  "Homosexual" can sometimes be considered outdated or clinical. "Gay" or "lesbian" are often preferred in everyday conversation.  While *homosexual* is a perfectly acceptable word in most contexts, some consider it overly formal or clinical-sounding. "Gay" and "lesbian" are generally seen as more natural and inclusive terms. *Same-sex* can be used as a neutral adjective. 

*  Be mindful of the context and audience when using this term.


The term *homoergan* is not a recognized or standard English word.  It appears to be a combination of "homo" (referring to same) and "ergan" (possibly related to "organ" or "ergonomic"). It's possible it's intended to relate to sexual activity or orientation, but without further context, its meaning is unclear.  It's important to use established and understood terminology to avoid confusion and miscommunication.
