词源: From French *cynique*, from Latin *cynicus*, from Greek *kynikós* “dog-like, currish,” from *kýōn* "dog."  The Cynics were a school of ancient Greek philosophers who believed that virtue was the only good and that its essence lay in self-control and independence.  Because of their unconventional lifestyle and rejection of social norms, they were compared to dogs.
