azimoff: /ˈæzɪmɒf/ (US) /ˈæzɪmɒf/ (UK)| n.|方位角偏移，方位偏移|A deviation from a given azimuth; the angular difference between true azimuth and magnetic azimuth.|The azimoff of the target was calculated to be 5 degrees.|近义词: azimuth deviation, bearing error|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

Etymology:  From *azimuth* + *-off*, indicating a deviation or difference from the azimuth.  *Azimuth* ultimately comes from the Arabic *al-sumūt* "the directions".
