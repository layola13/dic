PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It is a medical term and generally used directly.)


注意事项:

This word is considered vulgar and offensive in common usage.  It is primarily used in medical contexts. While "anus" is the clinically preferred term, "anals" is sometimes encountered in medical literature, particularly when referring to the anal canal or surrounding structures.  It is highly recommended to avoid using "anals" in everyday conversation.
