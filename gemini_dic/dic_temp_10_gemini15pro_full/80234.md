goemin:  This word doesn't appear to be a recognized English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (where you saw the word, what it was referring to), I might be able to offer more assistance.  Since I can't analyze "goemin," I'll provide an example analysis using the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something; used to refer to something when you do not know exactly what it is | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Example: What time is it? 现在几点了？ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for 'what') | word type: question word
