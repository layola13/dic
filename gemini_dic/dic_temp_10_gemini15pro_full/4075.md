词源:  Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba.  The word "aikido" is formed from three Japanese characters:  "ai" (harmony), "ki" (spirit, energy), and "do" (way, path).  Thus, aikido translates to "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or "the way of harmonious spirit."
