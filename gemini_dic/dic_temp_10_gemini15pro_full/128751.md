词源：

This word combines "nigger," a deeply offensive racial slur, with "head."  Its origins lie in the dehumanizing language used during slavery and its aftermath to denigrate Black people.  Even when referring to inanimate objects, the word carries the weight of its racist history and is therefore highly problematic.
