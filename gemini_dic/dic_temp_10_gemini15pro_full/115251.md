ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *manipulus* ("handful, bundle," later "maniple," a unit of Roman soldiers) + *-are* (verb-forming suffix). The original sense was "to handle or manage skillfully," especially with the hands. This evolved into the modern meaning of controlling or influencing something or someone, often in a deceitful or exploitative manner.
