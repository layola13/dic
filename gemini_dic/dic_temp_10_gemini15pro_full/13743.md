The word "auctary" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it's a very obscure or archaic term.  The closest possibilities are "auctionary" (related to auctions) or "auxiliary" (providing supplementary or additional help and support).  Since the prompt requests information on "auctary," I will provide information on both "auctionary" and "auxiliary" assuming that one of these was the intended word.

**Assuming the intended word is "auctionary":**

auctionary:/ˈɔːkʃəˌnɛri/ | adj. | 拍卖的 | Relating to auctions; of or pertaining to an auction.  |  例句：Auctionary prices can fluctuate wildly.  拍卖价格可能会大幅波动。 |  例句：The auctionary process was fast and efficient. 拍卖过程快速高效。 | 近义词：auction, bidding | 反义词: (No direct antonym) | 词性: adjective

**Assuming the intended word is "auxiliary":**

auxiliary: /ɔːɡˈzɪliəri/ | adj. n. | 辅助的，附属的; 辅助者，附属物 | Providing supplementary or additional help and support.  | Example:  The hospital has an auxiliary power supply. 医院有备用电源。 | Example: She works as an auxiliary nurse. 她是一名助理护士。| 近义词：supplementary, additional, supporting, reserve, backup | 反义词: primary, main, principal | 词性: adjective, noun
