词源：
"Non-" is a prefix of Latin origin meaning "not."
"Retarded" comes from the Latin "retardare," meaning "to slow down."  Therefore, "nonretarded" literally means "not slowed down."


注意事项:

The term "nonretarded" can be considered outdated and potentially offensive, especially when referring to individuals with intellectual disabilities.  "Typical development," "normal development," or simply "development" are preferred terms in most contexts.  When referring specifically to intellectual ability,  "average intelligence," "normal intelligence," or avoiding any explicit labeling is generally more appropriate and respectful.
