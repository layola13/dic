ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *clæne "free from dirt or defilement," from Proto-Germanic *klainja- (source also of Old Frisian klene, Middle Dutch cleine, Dutch klein "small, fine, slender," German klein "small, little," Old Norse hreinn "clean, pure"). The original sense was likely "bright, shining," later extended to "pure, unblemished." The "-liest" suffix is the Old English superlative ending.
