cotectic:/koʊˈtɛktɪk/| adj. n.|共结的；共结线；共结点|Relating to or denoting a mixture of substances whose components solidify simultaneously from the molten state at a single temperature and having a composition different from either of the components.|The cotectic point on the phase diagram represents the lowest temperature at which a liquid can exist in equilibrium with two solid phases.|近义词：eutectic (often used interchangeably, although technically distinct)|反义词:  (No direct antonym.  Perhaps "peritectic" as it describes a different type of three-phase reaction.)|词性: Adjective, Noun

Etymology:  From Greek "ko-" (together) + "tēktos" (molten).
