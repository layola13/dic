ETYMOLOGY->

From Old French *desconfiture* (Modern French *déconfiture*), from *desconfire* "to defeat, rout," from *des-* (expressing reversal) + *confire* "to preserve, pickle, prepare, finish, complete, defeat."  Ultimately from Latin *conficere* "to accomplish, complete." The semantic shift from "defeat" to "embarrassment" occurred in the 16th century.
