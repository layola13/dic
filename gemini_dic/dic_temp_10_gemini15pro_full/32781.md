词源:  "Choosy" likely originates from the verb "choose" with the added suffix "-y" to form an adjective.  The "-y" suffix often indicates a characteristic or quality, in this case, the quality of being selective or picky.  While the exact etymology is not widely documented, this formation is common in English.
