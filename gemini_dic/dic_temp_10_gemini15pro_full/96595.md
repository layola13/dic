inductional:/ɪnˈdʌkʃənəl/
|adj.|感应的，由归纳得出的|Relating to or produced by induction.  Pertaining to induction or proceeding by induction.|The inductional effect of the magnetic field caused the current to flow.|近义词：inductive|反义词:deductive|词性:形容词

词源: From "induction" + "-al".  "Induction" comes from Late Latin *inductionem (nominative inductio) "a leading into, introduction," noun of action from past-participle stem of inducere "to lead in," from in- "in" + ducere "to lead."
