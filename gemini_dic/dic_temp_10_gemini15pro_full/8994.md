antilibration:/ˌæntiˌlaɪˈbreɪʃən/ | n. |  天秤动 | The apparent slight oscillation of a celestial body about its mean position, especially that of the Moon or a synchronous satellite, caused by the ellipticity of its orbit. | The spacecraft's orbit was designed to minimize the effects of antilibration.  该航天器的轨道设计旨在最大限度地减少天秤动的影响。 |  libration (this is more a contrasting phenomenon than a synonym), oscillation | N/A | noun


antilibration:/ˌæntiˌlaɪˈbreɪʃən/ | n. | 天秤动 | A small periodic oscillation in the apparent position of a celestial body, as the Moon, relative to its mean position. |  Astronomers study the antilibration of the moon to learn more about its orbit. 天文学家研究月球的天秤动以了解更多关于其轨道的信息。| libration (this is more a contrasting phenomenon than a synonym), oscillation | N/A | noun
