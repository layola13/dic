The word "argis" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a lexical analysis for it.  It's possible that it is:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant "ArGIS," which could be a shortened form of "Argonne Geographic Information System," or another similar proper noun related to GIS software or a specific project.
* **A technical term or jargon:** It might be specific to a particular field or company.
* **A newly coined word:**  Although unlikely, it's possible it's a very recent term.
* **A name:** It could be a person's name, a place name, or a product name.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide more information.


Since I cannot analyze "argis," I will provide an analysis for the common English word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
