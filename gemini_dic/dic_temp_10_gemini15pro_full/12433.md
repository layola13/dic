askewness:/skjuːnɪs/
n.|偏度，偏斜度|A statistical measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution about its mean.  It describes the degree to which a distribution is skewed to the left (negative skew) or to the right (positive skew).|The askewness of the data suggests that there are more outliers on the high end.|synonyms: asymmetry, skewedness, lopsidedness|antonyms: symmetry, balance|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From skew + -ness.  Skew itself comes from Old North French eskiuer "to shy away, swerve".
