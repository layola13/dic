ETYMOLOGY->
The surname Brontë is of uncertain origin. It's believed to be a variant of the Irish surname Ó Pronntaigh, meaning "descendant of Prontach".  Patrick Brontë, the father of the Brontë sisters, altered the spelling of the family name several times, eventually settling on Brontë, possibly inspired by the title of Horatio Nelson, Duke of Bronté (a town in Sicily).
