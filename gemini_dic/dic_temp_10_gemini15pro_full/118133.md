注意事项:
* "Menschen" is a German word.  While understandable in some English contexts (particularly academic or philosophical ones with a German influence), "people" or "humans" are generally preferred in standard English.  The usage examples provided reflect this, often translating "Menschen" as "people" or "humans" for natural English sentences.
*  There's no direct antonym for "people" or "humans." The closest antonym would depend on the specific context. For example, in a discussion of rights, the opposite might be "animals." In a discussion of societal structures, it might be "individuals."
* The pronunciation provided is an approximation of how a German speaker would say "Menschen." The actual pronunciation can vary slightly based on regional dialects.
