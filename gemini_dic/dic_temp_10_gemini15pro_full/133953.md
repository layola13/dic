PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically form common phrases.  Its negative nature and formal register limit its colloquial usage.)


词源:
"Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "heinous" (adjective meaning "wicked" or "atrocious") + "-ly" (adverb suffix).  "Heinous" ultimately derives from the Old French "haineus," meaning "hateful."
