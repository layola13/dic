ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *frank*, from Old French *franc* ("free, liberal, generous"), from Frankish *frank* ("free"), from Proto-Germanic *franką* ("free, not in bondage, noble").  The semantic shift from "free" to "honest" occurred because free men, unlike slaves, were able to speak their minds openly.
