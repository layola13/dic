dermobranchiata:/ˌdɜːrmoʊbræŋˈkiːɑːtə/ | n. | 皮鳃亚纲 |A subclass of marine gastropods (sea slugs) that breathe through their skin and often have elaborate, branching external projections.  They are known for their bright colors and often toxic or distasteful properties, which serve as a defense mechanism.| The dermobranchiata exhibit striking colors. 皮鳃亚纲的动物展现出惊人的颜色。| The nudibranch *Tritonia festiva* belongs to the subclass Dermobranchiata.  裸鳃类动物*Tritonia festiva*属于皮鳃亚纲。 | synonym: Nudibranchia (often used synonymously, but taxonomically distinct) | antonym: (No direct antonym, as it is a taxonomic classification. Could consider contrasting it with other gastropod subclasses like Pulmonata (lunged snails)) | noun

Look at that nudibranch! 看看那只裸鳃动物！
The nudibranch's colors are amazing.  裸鳃动物的颜色真是太神奇了。
Have you ever seen a nudibranch before? 你以前见过裸鳃动物吗？
