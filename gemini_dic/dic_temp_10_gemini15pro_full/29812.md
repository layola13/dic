ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "catch out," which combines the verb "catch" (from Old North French cachier, meaning "to chase, pursue, seize") with the adverb/preposition "out" (from Old English ūt, meaning "out, outside"). The meaning evolved from the literal sense of catching someone outside or away from safety to the figurative sense of catching someone in a lie or mistake.
