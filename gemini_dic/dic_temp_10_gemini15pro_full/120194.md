ETYMOLOGY->

"Mine" comes from the Old English word "min," meaning "ore," which itself comes from the Proto-Germanic "*meino," also meaning "ore."  It relates to the act of digging and extracting materials from the earth.

"Craft" comes from the Old English word "cræft," meaning "strength, skill, art,"  from the Proto-Germanic "*kraftiz."  It implies skill, artistry, and creation.

The combination of "mine" and "craft" reflects the core gameplay of the game: mining for materials and crafting items and structures.
