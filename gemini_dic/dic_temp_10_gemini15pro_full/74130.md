ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *founden*, from Old French *fonder* (to melt, cast metal), from Latin *fundere* (to pour, melt), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰewd- (to pour, libate). The meaning "establish" developed from the sense of "laying a foundation."  The meaning "discover" is a development from Old French *trover* which was influenced by *fonder*.
