PHRASE->
Not applicable. "Blaze forth" is typically used on its own and doesn't form common phrases.


词源：
"Blaze" comes from Old English *blǣsan, meaning "to blow, blast, burn."  "Forth" comes from Old English forþ, meaning "forward, onward, out."  Therefore, "blaze forth" literally means to burn or shine outwards.
