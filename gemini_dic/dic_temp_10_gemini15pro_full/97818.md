From "ink" + "horn" + "-ism."  "Inkhorn" referred to the small container of ink carried by scholars, symbolizing learning.  The term "inkhorn term" arose in the 16th century to describe words borrowed from Latin or Greek that seemed unnecessarily complex and showy. Over time, "inkhornism" became the preferred form.
