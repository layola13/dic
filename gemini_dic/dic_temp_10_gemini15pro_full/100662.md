Etymology-> From Late Middle English *entonen*, from Old French *entoner*, from Latin *intonare* (“to thunder, intone”), from *in* (“in”) + *tonare* (“to thunder”).  The sense development appears to have proceeded from "to make a thundering sound" to "to sing" to "to chant" to "to speak in a monotone".
