注意事项:
*The term "nigritic" can be considered outdated and potentially offensive.  While it appears in some scientific and historical texts, it's generally preferable to use more contemporary and respectful terms like "Black" or "African" when referring to people of African descent.  This response provides information on the word as requested, but it is important to be mindful of the potential for offense when using this term.
