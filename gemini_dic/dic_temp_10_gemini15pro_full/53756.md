ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *desconfit*, past participle of *desconfire* "to defeat, rout," from *des-* "expressing reversal" (from Latin *dis-*) + *confire* "to prepare, accomplish, finish," from Latin *conficere* "to do thoroughly, complete, execute."  The original meaning was "to defeat utterly," which evolved to "to frustrate" and then to its current sense of "to embarrass or disconcert."
