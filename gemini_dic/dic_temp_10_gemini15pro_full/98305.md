PHRASE->
(While "insight's" as a possessive is grammatically correct, it's less common and often sounds awkward.  It's more natural to rephrase using "of".)

the power of someone's insight = 某人洞察力的力量
the depth of someone's insight = 某人洞察力的深度
the clarity of someone's insight = 某人洞察力的清晰度
the brilliance of someone's insight = 某人洞察力的光辉
the accuracy of someone's insight = 某人洞察力的准确性


注意事项:
Although grammatically correct, using "insight's" can sound awkward. It is generally recommended to rephrase using "of" constructions. For example, instead of "The expert's insight's significance," use "The significance of the expert's insight." This improves clarity and flow.
