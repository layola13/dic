ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + proportion + -al + -ly.  "Dis-" is a Latin prefix meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force.  "Proportion" comes from the Latin "proportio," meaning "comparative relation of one thing to another, analogy, symmetry." "-al" forms adjectives meaning "relating to," and "-ly" forms adverbs from adjectives.
