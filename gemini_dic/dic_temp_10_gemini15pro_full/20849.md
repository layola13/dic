blastula:/ˈblæstʃələ/ (US) /ˈblæstjʊlə/ (UK)| n. |囊胚|An early stage of embryonic development in animals, consisting of a hollow sphere of cells enclosing a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel.  It is formed by the cleavage of a fertilized ovum and precedes the gastrula stage.|The blastula stage is crucial for the development of the embryo.|Synonyms: blastosphere, blastocyst (in mammals)|Antonyms: N/A|noun
