Etymology:
From motion + -less + -ness + -es

motion (n.)
late 14c., "the act of moving; change of place or position," from Old French mocion "motion, gesture, movement" (12c.), and directly from Latin motionem (nominative motio) "a moving, motion, movement; a proposal, proposition," noun of action from past-participle stem of movere "to move" (from PIE root *meue- "to push away").

-less (suffix)
Old English -leas "free from, without," from Proto-Germanic *-lausaz (source also of Old Saxon -los, Old Frisian -les, Dutch -loos, German -los, Old Norse -lauss, Gothic -laus), from PIE root *leik- "to leave, quit, let go."

-ness (suffix)
Old English -nes(s), -nis(s), -nys(s), from Proto-Germanic *-nassjaz (source also of Old Saxon and Old Frisian -nissi, Dutch -nis, German -nis, Gothic -inassus), from PIE *-t-ya forming abstract nouns, from PIE root *nei- "to lead, guide."

-es (suffix)
plural marker.
