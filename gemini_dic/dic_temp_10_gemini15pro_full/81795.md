ETYMOLOGY->
From French *grenadier* (referring to a soldier originally trained to throw grenades), from *grenade* "pomegranate," from Old Provençal *granada*, from Late Latin *granata*, noun use of feminine of Latin *granatus* "having many grains," from *granum* "grain." The sense shift occurred because early grenades resembled pomegranates in shape and the scattering of their fragments.
