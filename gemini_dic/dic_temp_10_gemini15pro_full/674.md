ETYMOLOGY->
From abbreviation of *abdominals*, from Latin *abdomen* (belly).

USAGE->
Possession:
My abs's are sore after the workout. = 我的腹肌在锻炼后很酸痛。
His abs's are very defined. = 他的腹肌线条分明。

Description:
Her abs's look strong. = 她的腹肌看起来很强壮。
The trainer focused on exercises for the abs's. = 教练专注于腹肌锻炼。

Pluralization (less common, but sometimes used for emphasis on individual muscles within the group):
He has well-defined upper and lower abs's. = 他有清晰的上下腹肌。  (More commonly phrased as "upper and lower abs")
She's working on all her different abs's. = 她正在锻炼她所有不同的腹肌。(More commonly phrased as "all her different ab muscles")


PHRASE->
work on one's abs's = 锻炼腹肌
toned abs's = 健美的腹肌
defined abs's = 线条分明的腹肌
rock-hard abs's = 坚硬的腹肌
show off one's abs's = 展示腹肌

注意事项:

While "abs" is already a plural noun (short for abdominals), the use of "abs's" to indicate possession is quite informal and sometimes considered grammatically incorrect.  It's more common and generally accepted to simply use "abs" to express possession (e.g., "my abs are sore").  "Abdominal muscles" is a more formal alternative.  Using "abs'" with an apostrophe after the "s" (to pluralize "abs") is generally avoided.
