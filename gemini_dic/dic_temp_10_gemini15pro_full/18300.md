词源:

"Bellan" likely originates from Italian "bella," meaning "beautiful" or "fair." It's also possible it's a variant of "belladonna," literally meaning "beautiful woman" in Italian, but more commonly associated with the poisonous plant deadly nightshade.  The use of "bellan" as a standalone word is relatively uncommon and might be considered informal or dialectal.
