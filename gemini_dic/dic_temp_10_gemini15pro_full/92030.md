hyperpathetically:/ˌhaɪpərˈpəˈθetɪkli/| adv.| 假设地，超假设地|In a way that is exaggerated or based on extreme assumptions; in a hypothetical manner that goes beyond the realm of reasonable possibility.  It implies a level of speculation that is so extreme as to be almost absurd.|Hyperpathetically speaking, if everyone on Earth jumped at the same time, the planet would shift its orbit.|近义词：theoretically, hypothetically, conjecturally|反义词：actually, factually, realistically|词性:副词

Etymology:
From hyper- "excessive" + pathetically (from Greek pathos "suffering, feeling") + -ally (adverbial suffix).  While "pathetically" usually means "in a way that arouses pity," in this context, it refers to the emotional or imaginative basis of a hypothesis.
