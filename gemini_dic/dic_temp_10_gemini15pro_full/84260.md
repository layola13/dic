half-sterile:/ˌhæf ˈsteraɪl/ | adj. | 半不育的，部分不育的 | Partially sterile; not completely sterile.  Refers to something that reduces fertility but doesn't eliminate it completely. |  The half-sterile hybrid plants produced fewer seeds. 这些半不育的杂交植物产生的种子较少。| Near Synonyms: subfertile, partially fertile | Antonyms: fertile, fully sterile | Adjective


half-sterile:/ˌhæf ˈsteraɪl/ | n. | 半不育个体 | An organism that is partially sterile. | The study focused on the genetics of half-steriles. 这项研究集中在半不育个体的遗传学上。 | Near Synonyms: subfertile organism | Antonyms: fertile organism | Noun

Etymology:
"half-" (Old English healf) meaning "one of two equal parts" + "sterile" (from Latin sterilis meaning "barren, unproductive").
