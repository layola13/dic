词源:
"Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Frigid" comes from the Latin "frigidus," meaning "cold," ultimately from "frigus," meaning "coldness" or "frost."  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. “Non-”是一个前缀，意思是“不”。“Frigid”来自拉丁语“frigidus”，意思是“冷”，最终来自“frigus”，意思是“冷”或“霜”。“-ness”是一个用来从形容词构成名词的后缀，表示状态或性质。
