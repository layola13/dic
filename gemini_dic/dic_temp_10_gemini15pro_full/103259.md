注意事项:
The term "Jewess" is now largely considered archaic and offensive. While it has been used historically to refer to Jewish women,  "Jewish woman" is the preferred and respectful term in modern usage.  Using "Jewess" can be perceived as othering and perpetuating harmful stereotypes.  Avoid using this term unless in a historical context where accuracy requires it, and even then, consider adding a disclaimer about its modern connotations.
