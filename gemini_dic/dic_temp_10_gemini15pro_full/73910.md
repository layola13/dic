ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *forstallen*, from Old English *forsteallan* ("to hinder, prevent, anticipate"), from *for-* ("before, against") + *steallan* ("to steal, leap").  The original sense was "to intercept or hinder by prior action," akin to lying in wait for someone to rob them.  Over time, the meaning shifted to preventing something from happening, not just by interception, but by any preemptive action.
