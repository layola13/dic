ependymis:/ɛˈpɛndɪmɪs/
noun
室管膜
A thin membrane of glial cells lining the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. It produces and circulates cerebrospinal fluid.
The ependymis plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the cerebrospinal fluid. 室管膜在维持脑脊液的稳态中起着至关重要的作用。
Damage to the ependymis can disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.  对室管膜的损害会扰乱脑脊液的流动。
synonym:  lining, epithelium (in a broader sense)
antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical structure)
n.
