"Coier" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a slang/vulgar term, possibly derived from "coitus."  Because it's not a standard word, providing a full lexical analysis is difficult. However, I can analyze the likely intended word, "coitus," and address the possible misspelling.

**Coitus:** /ˈkoʊɪtəs/ | n. |性交 | Sexual intercourse. |例句：Coitus is the biological act of reproduction in humans. 性交是人类的生物繁殖行为。

|例句：The study investigated the frequency of coitus among married couples. 这项研究调查了已婚夫妇性交的频率。|近义词：intercourse, copulation, sexual relations |反义词: abstinence |词性: noun

**Possible interpretations of "coier":**

* **Misspelling of "coitus":**  This is the most likely scenario. In this case, the meaning would be the same as "coitus."

* **Slang/vulgar term:**  It could be a vulgar or slang term derived from "coitus," possibly used as a verb meaning "to have sexual intercourse with." However, this usage is not standard and could be considered offensive.
