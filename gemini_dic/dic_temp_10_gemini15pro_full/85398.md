词源：  "Haruku" appears to be a loanword, potentially from Indonesian or Malay.  In Indonesian, "haruku" isn't a standard word, but it bears resemblance to words related to disruption or chaos.  Further investigation into the specific language of origin would be needed for a more accurate etymology.  Since it's not a common English word, it lacks a documented etymology in English resources.  It's essential to verify the intended language and meaning if encountered.
