What happened to myir? = 我的东西怎么了？
Give me myir back! = 把我的东西还给我！
That's myir! = 那是我的东西！

注意事项:

"myir" is not standard English. While it might be used in certain dialects (possibly Irish influenced), it would be considered incorrect in formal or standard English contexts.  Use "my" or "mine" instead.
