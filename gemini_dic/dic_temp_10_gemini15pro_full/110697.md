linearities:/ˌlɪniˈæɹɪtiz/| n.|线性，线性关系|The property of being linear; the relationships or patterns that follow a straight line or adhere to the principles of linearity.  This often involves a direct proportionality between two variables.|The graph demonstrates the linearities of the relationship between force and acceleration.|Synonyms: linearity, proportional relationships, direct variations|Antonyms: nonlinearities, nonlinear relationships, exponential growth|noun
