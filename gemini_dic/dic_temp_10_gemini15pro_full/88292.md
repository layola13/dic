PHRASE->
(While "hip's" isn't commonly used in set phrases, here are examples using "hip" that can be adapted to possessive form if context allows):
catch someone on the hip  抓住某人的弱点
smite hip and thigh  彻底击败

注意事项:
Though grammatically correct, "hip's" as a possessive is less common than "one's hip" or "the hip." Using "hip's" can sometimes sound awkward or informal.  Rephrasing with "of the hip" might be smoother in some cases.  For instance, "the flexibility of the hip" is preferable to "the hip's flexibility" in formal writing.
