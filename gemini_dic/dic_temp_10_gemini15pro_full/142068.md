The word "orgeis" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from a specialized field or a different language.  If you can provide more context (like where you encountered this word), I can try to help further.

Since I can't analyze "orgeis", I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "what":
