词源:
Originating in the American West in the mid-19th century, the etymology of "mosey" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's a blend of "mose" (an obsolete variant of "moose") and "easy," implying a slow, meandering movement like a moose.  Another possibility is a connection to the Spanish verb "vamos," meaning "let's go," which might have been transformed into "mosey" through colloquial usage.
