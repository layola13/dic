{isdns}  This is not a valid English word. It appears to be a combination of "is" and "DNS".  There is no standard meaning for this combination. It could potentially be used in informal technical contexts as shorthand for "is DNS"  as in "The problem is DNS," meaning the problem lies with the Domain Name System.  However, this is not standard usage.
