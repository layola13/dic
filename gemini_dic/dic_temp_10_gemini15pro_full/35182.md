词源: From Middle English *cloyen, from Anglo-Norman encloyer (“to stop up, to clog, to nail”), from Old French enclouer (“to nail up, to spike a cannon”), from en- + clou (“nail”), from Latin clavus.  The figurative sense of “to surfeit, satiate” arose from the idea of clogging or stopping up the appetite.
