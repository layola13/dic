注意事项:
The word "devis" is primarily used in British English, particularly in construction and engineering contexts.  While it can technically also mean "device" or "motto," these meanings are less common.  It is crucial to understand its primary meaning as an estimate or quotation.  In American English, "estimate" or "quote" are the more common terms.
