ETYMOLOGY->
From dainty + -fy.  "Dainty" comes from Old French *daintie, from Latin dignitatem "worthiness, dignity,"  meaning something of value and thus worthy of care and refinement.  The "-fy" suffix comes from Old French -fier and ultimately from Latin -ficare, meaning "to make."  Thus, "daintify" literally means "to make dainty."
