ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English fæthm "embracing arms, grasp, length of outstretched arms," (related to Old Frisian fethum, Old Norse faðmr "bosom, embrace," Gothic faþms "embrace") + -less.  Originally literal, referring to something too deep to be measured by a sounding line, it later acquired the figurative sense of "incomprehensible."
