There seems to be a misunderstanding.  "Kuan" isn't a recognized English word.  It might be a misspelling, slang, a name, or a word from another language. If you can provide more context (like a sentence where you saw it used), I might be able to help.

Since I can't analyze "kuan," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv.| 什么,哪一个,多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for 'what') | Pronoun/Determiner/Adverb


what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) |  int. |  多么 | Used to express surprise or strong feelings. | Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！| Synonym: how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for 'what') | Interjection
