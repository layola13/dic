词源： "joller" likely comes from the verb "to joll" or "to jolle," which are obsolete terms meaning "to knock about, to shake, to jolt."  The sense of playful or mischievous movement is likely how the word evolved to its current meanings.  Unfortunately, precise etymological details are scarce for this word.  It's considered a colloquial or dialectal term and doesn't appear in many standard dictionaries.
