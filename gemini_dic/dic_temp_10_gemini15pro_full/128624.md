nickelian: /nɪˈkɛliən/ | adj. | 镍的；含镍的 | Containing or relating to nickel. |  The nickelian ore is valuable. 这种含镍的矿石很值钱。 |  Nickel-bearing, nickel-rich |  N/A | adjective

Etymology->
From nickel + -ian.  Ultimately from German *Kupfernickel 'copper demon,' as the ore resembled copper but yielded none, as if a mischievous sprite had bewitched it.
