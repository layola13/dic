PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases. The singular form, "ill-disposedness," is slightly more common, but still infrequent.  Therefore, providing phrases for the plural form is difficult and might not reflect actual usage.)


词源：From ill- + disposed + -ness.  "Ill" meaning bad or unfavorable, "disposed" meaning inclined or having a tendency, and "-ness" forming a noun denoting a state or quality.
