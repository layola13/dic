geophysicses:/ˌdʒiːoʊˈfɪzɪksɪz/ | n. | 地球物理学(geophysics的复数形式，很少使用) | The study of the physical properties and processes of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, including the structure, composition, and dynamics of the Earth's interior, oceans, atmosphere, and magnetosphere. |  Geophysicses is rarely used; "geophysics" is typically treated as an uncountable noun.  It's better to say "various branches of geophysics" or "different geophysical methods". |  Near Synonyms:  geophysics | Antonyms: N/A | noun
