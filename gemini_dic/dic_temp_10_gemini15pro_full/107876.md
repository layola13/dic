largifical: /lɑːrdʒɪfɪkəl/
adjective
慷慨的，大方的 (Not a standard English word)
This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It seems to be a blend of "large" and "beneficial," perhaps intended to mean generous or giving freely.  It's likely a neologism or informal creation.
There are no established examples for this word as it isn't a recognized English word.  You could try a construction like:  "He made a largifical donation to the charity," but it would be better to use a standard word like "generous" or "substantial."
