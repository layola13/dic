nonsymmetric:/ˌnɒn sɪˈmetrɪk/ /ˌnɑːn sɪˈmetrɪk/| adj.|非对称的，不对称的|Not symmetric; lacking symmetry.  A figure is nonsymmetric if it cannot be divided into two identical halves.|The design was intentionally nonsymmetric, giving it a more modern feel.  该设计有意地采用了不对称的形式，使其更具现代感。|asymmetric, unsymmetric, dissymmetric|symmetric, symmetrical|adjective
Etymology->
From non- + symmetric.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "symmetric" comes from the Greek "symmetria," meaning "agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement."
