词源: "agers" is derived from "age" (n.), ultimately from Old French "age," from Latin "aetatem" (nominative "aetas") "lifetime, age, generation." The "-er" suffix is used to form agent nouns, indicating someone or something that performs the action of the verb or embodies the quality of the noun. In this case, "agers" denotes individuals associated with a particular age or period.
