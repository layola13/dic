**词源:**

Both "manille" and "Manila" ultimately derive from the Tagalog word *Maynilà*,  the name of the region where the abacá plant is native and where the city of Manila is located. The name likely refers to the presence of *nila* plants, a type of indigo.  Over time, the pronunciation and spelling evolved, leading to the two distinct forms in English.  "Manille" primarily refers to the fiber or the card game, while "Manila" refers to the city.
