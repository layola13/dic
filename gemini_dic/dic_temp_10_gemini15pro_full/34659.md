词源: From Old French clergie "clergy, scholarship," from Late Latin clericatus "clerical office," from clericus "cleric" (see cleric). Originally "learning, scholarship" (as in clerk). The meaning "clergy" arose from the fact that in the Middle Ages, learning and scholarship were largely confined to the clergy.
