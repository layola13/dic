ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *higlen, frequentative of obsolete *higen "to hire," of uncertain origin.  Possibly related to Old Norse hyggja "to comfort, cherish," or to a lost Germanic root *hugjan, meaning "to think, consider, intend." The semantic shift from "hire" to "bargain" likely arose through the process of negotiating wages or hiring prices.
