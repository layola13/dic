compiler:/kəmˈpaɪlər/| n.|编译器|A program that translates source code written in a high-level language (like Java or C++) into a lower-level language (like assembly language or machine code) that a computer can understand and execute.|The compiler detected several errors in the code.|Synonym: translator|Antonym: interpreter|noun

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The compiler has been working on this large project for hours. = 编译器已经在这个大型项目上工作了几个小时。
The compiler has been optimizing the code for better performance. = 编译器一直在优化代码以获得更好的性能。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The compiler detected a segmentation fault. = 编译器检测到一个段错误。
The compiler generated the assembly code successfully. = 编译器成功生成了汇编代码。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The compiler was processing the code when the power went out. = 断电时，编译器正在处理代码。
The compiler was optimizing the code for speed. = 编译器当时正在优化代码的速度。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The compiler had finished compiling the program before the deadline. = 编译器在截止日期前完成了程序的编译。
The compiler had already detected the error before I noticed it. = 在我注意到之前，编译器已经检测到了错误。

By the time you return, the compiler will have been compiling the program for several hours. = 当你回来的时候，编译器将已经编译程序几个小时了。


虚拟语气:
If I had a better compiler, I could compile this code faster. = 如果我有一个更好的编译器，我就可以更快地编译这段代码。
I wish the compiler would give me more helpful error messages. = 我希望编译器能给我更多有用的错误信息。

被动语态:
