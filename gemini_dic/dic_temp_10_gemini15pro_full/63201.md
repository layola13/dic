PHRASE->
(Entend doesn't typically form strong idiomatic phrases.  It's more formally used. Here are some examples using "understand" which shares a similar meaning and is more commonly used in phrases.)
Do you understand? = 你明白了吗？
I understand perfectly. = 我完全理解。
I don't understand what you mean. = 我不明白你的意思。
It is understood that... = 据了解……
Make yourself understood. = 把你的意思表达清楚。


注意事项:  "Entend" is less commonly used than "understand" and can sound overly formal or archaic in modern English.  Consider using "understand" in most cases.
