词源:  "Deconstruct" and its derivatives come from the French word "déconstruire," which literally means "to deconstruct" or "to take apart."  The French word is formed from the prefix "dé-" (meaning "un-" or "reverse") and the verb "construire" (meaning "to construct").  The philosophical term "deconstruction" was coined by Jacques Derrida.
