nanoseconds:/ˈnænoʊˌsekəndz/ |n.|纳秒|A unit of time equal to one billionth of a second.|The computer processed the information in nanoseconds.|近义词: ns (abbreviation)|反义词: (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement.  Could consider larger units like milliseconds, seconds, etc.)|noun

Etymology:
From nano- + second,  "nano-" being a prefix denoting one billionth. Ultimately from Greek "nanos" (dwarf) and Latin "secundus" (following, second).
