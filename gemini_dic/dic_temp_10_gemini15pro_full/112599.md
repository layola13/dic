Etymology: From "loving" (adjective) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition).  "Loving" comes from the Old English "lufiende," present participle of "lufian" (to love), which is related to the Old High German "lubôn" and the Gothic "liuban," all from a Proto-Germanic root meaning "to love" or "to be dear."
