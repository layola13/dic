词源： "over-" (prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much") + "fee" (noun meaning "a payment made to a professional person or to a professional or public body in exchange for advice or services").  "Over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above," "over," "beyond." "Fee" comes from Old French "fie," ultimately from Latin "feudum," meaning "feudal estate."
