nondissipatedly:/nɒndɪˈsɪpeɪtɪdli/ | adv. | 非耗散地，不消散地 | In a way that does not dissipate or scatter; in a concentrated or focused manner.  The energy was transmitted nondissipatedly through the system. 能量以非耗散的方式在系统中传输。 | 近义词: cohesively, concentratedly, focally | 反义词: dissipatedly, diffusely | 词性: 副词

Etymology:
non- (prefix):  from Latin *non, meaning "not"
dissipated (adjective): from Latin dissipatus, past participle of dissipare "to scatter," from dis- "apart" + sipare "to throw, scatter"
-ly (suffix): forms adverbs
