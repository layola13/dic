fractals:/ˈfræktəlz/
n.
分形，分形体
A fractal is a curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.
Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales.
分形是无限复杂的图案，在不同的尺度上自相似。

The branching of trees and the intricate patterns of snowflakes are examples of fractals in nature.
树木的分支和雪花的复杂图案是自然界中分形的例子。


Synonym:
self-similar patterns, recursive patterns


Antonym:
Euclidean geometry (arguably)
