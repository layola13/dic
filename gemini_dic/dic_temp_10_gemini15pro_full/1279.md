ETYMOLOGY->
From French accouchement, from accoucher "to put to bed," from à "to" + coucher "to lie down."

USAGE->
This word is somewhat dated and formal and is less common than "childbirth" or "delivery."  It's more likely to be found in older literature or medical texts.

Examples in sentences (though somewhat contrived due to the word's infrequent usage):

一般现在时:
The accouchement is scheduled for next week. = 分娩安排在下周。
The hospital specializes in accouchement and postnatal care. = 这家医院专门从事分娩和产后护理。

一般过去时:
Her accouchement was uncomplicated. = 她的分娩很顺利。
The accouchement took place at home. = 分娩是在家里进行的。


现在完成时:
The accouchement has been successful. = 分娩成功了。
She has experienced a difficult accouchement. = 她经历了一次艰难的分娩。

过去完成时:

They had prepared everything for the accouchement. = 他们已经为分娩做好了一切准备。

将来时:

被动语态:

PHRASE->
(Due to the formal and less common nature of "accouchement,"  set phrases are rare.  It's typically used standalone.)


注意事项:
As noted above, this word is somewhat archaic and formal. While understood,  "childbirth" or "delivery" are generally preferred in modern usage.  Using "accouchement" might sound overly formal or even pretentious in everyday conversation.
