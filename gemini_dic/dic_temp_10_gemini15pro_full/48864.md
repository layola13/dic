词源：deformedness comes from the adjective "deformed" + the suffix "-ness," which turns an adjective into a noun indicating a state or quality. "Deformed" itself comes from the Old French "deformer," meaning "to disfigure," ultimately derived from the Latin "deformare," from "de-" (from, away from) + "formare" (to form).  The plural form simply adds the regular English plural suffix "-es."
