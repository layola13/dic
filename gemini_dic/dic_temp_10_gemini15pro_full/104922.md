The word "kejia" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.

Assuming you meant a similar-sounding English word or perhaps a Chinese word transliterated into English,  I will analyze the word "what" as a placeholder since your prompt focuses heavily on the grammar and usage of "what."
