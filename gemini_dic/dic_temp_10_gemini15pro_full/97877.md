词源: "inmostly" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word formed by combining "in" and "mostly." While "mostly" itself is a common adverb meaning "mainly" or "for the most part," adding "in" suggests a spatial or conceptual inwardness.  Its usage is not established and may be considered informal or even incorrect in formal contexts.  It's more effective to use established words like "primarily," "mainly," "chiefly," or "largely."  If emphasizing location, use phrases like "mostly inside" or "primarily within."
