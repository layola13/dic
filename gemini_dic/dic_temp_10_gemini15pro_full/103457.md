ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *jobbe*, *jobben* (“a lump, piece, portion”), perhaps from Anglo-Norman *job* (compare Old French *jobe* (“a game of chance”)), of uncertain origin.  Some suggest a connection with gob ("mouthful, lump").  The sense of “a piece of work” developed from the notion of a lump or portion of work to be done. The modern sense of "regular paid employment" emerged in the 18th century.
