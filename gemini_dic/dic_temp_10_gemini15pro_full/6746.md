analyticity:/ˌænəˈlɪsɪti/ | n. | 解析性 | The quality or state of being analytic.  A function is said to have analyticity in a region if it is differentiable at every point in that region and its derivative is also continuous. | The analyticity of the function allows us to represent it as a power series.  这个函数的解析性允许我们将其表示为幂级数。 | 近义词: differentiability, holomorphism (for complex functions) | 反义词: non-analyticity | 词性: noun

词源: From analytic + -ity.  "Analytic" comes from the French *analytique* and ultimately from the Greek *analutikós*, from *analúein* "to unloose, resolve".
