词源： fraud (n.)  late 14c., "dishonesty, deceit, trickery," from Old French fraude "fraud, deceit, trickery, dishonesty" (12c.), from Latin fraudem (nominative fraus) "injury, harm, damage; offense; deceit, trickery, treachery," of uncertain origin.  Perhaps ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bhreu- "to deceive, fail, make a mistake."
