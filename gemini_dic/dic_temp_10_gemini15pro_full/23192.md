Etymology->
From bow (verb) + -ed + -ness.  "Bow" in this context refers to bending or curving.  The "-ed" suffix creates an adjective (bowed), and the "-ness" suffix turns the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being bowed.  Ultimately derived from Old English *būgan "to bend."
