Etymology:
From Middle English *fondere*, comparative of *fond*, from Old English *gefond*, past participle of *gefondian* "to try, test, experience," from Proto-Germanic *fandijaną* "to try, tempt, find," from Proto-Indo-European *pent-* "to tread, go, find."  The semantic shift from "try" to "be fond of" likely occurred through the notion of finding something agreeable or pleasant after trying it.
