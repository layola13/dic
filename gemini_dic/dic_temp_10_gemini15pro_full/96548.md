indophenol:/ˌɪndoʊˈfiːnɒl/ | n. |靛酚|A class of organic compounds, many of which are intensely colored and used as dyes or indicators in chemical reactions. They are formed by the condensation of a phenol with a nitroso compound or quinoneimine.|The indophenol test is used to detect the presence of ammonia.|Synonyms: indicator, dye|Antonyms: N/A|noun


indophenol:/ˌɪndoʊˈfiːnɒl/ | n. |靛酚|A class of organic compounds often used as redox indicators due to their distinct color changes upon oxidation and reduction.  They are characterized by a nitrogen atom linked to two aromatic rings, one of which is a phenol.|The solution turned blue upon addition of the indophenol indicator, signaling the completion of the reaction. |Synonyms: redox indicator, dye|Antonyms: N/A|noun
