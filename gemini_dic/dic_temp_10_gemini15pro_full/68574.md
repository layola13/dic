fanka is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  It's possible this is:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "fanatic," "funk," "fang," or another similar-sounding word.
2. **Slang/informal:**  It could be a newly coined slang term, a regionalism, or a word used within a specific community.
3. **A proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand.
4. **From another language:**  While less likely given the letters used, it could be borrowed from another language.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more accurate interpretation.
