词源:  The origin of "jigger" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's related to "chigger," a type of mite, due to the small size of both. Another suggests a connection to the verb "jig," referring to a quick, jerky movement.  The meaning related to alcohol measures likely comes from the 19th century.
