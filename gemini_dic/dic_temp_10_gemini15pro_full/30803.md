注意事项:

Cevapi (ćevapi) is the plural form.  The singular is ćevap.  The pronunciation given is a simplified, anglicized pronunciation.  The more accurate pronunciation would involve a sound not present in English.

Different spellings exist, including cevapi, ćevapi, ćevapčići, and other variations.


While technically a noun, it functions similarly to a mass noun in English, so you wouldn't typically say "a cevapi" except when referring to a single piece (ćevap) or a specific serving (e.g., "a plate of cevapi").
