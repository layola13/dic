These creatures are characterized by their flattened, segmented bodies and seven pairs of legs. |  例句：The creature discovered in the deep sea had a distinctly isopodiform appearance.  在深海发现的这种生物具有明显的等足类动物的外形。

例句：Scientists are studying the unique adaptations of isopodiform crustaceans to extreme environments. 科学家正在研究等足类甲壳类动物对极端环境的独特适应性。 | 近义词：isopod-like,  | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
From "Isopoda" + "-form".  "Isopoda" comes from the Greek "isos" (equal) + "pous" (foot), referring to the similar size and shape of their legs.  "-form" is a suffix meaning "having the form of".
