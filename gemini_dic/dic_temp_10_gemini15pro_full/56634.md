词源:
"donkeyest" is a superlative adjective formed by adding the suffix "-est" to the noun "donkey".  "Donkey" itself comes from the Old English "dunki", of uncertain origin, perhaps related to a Celtic word meaning "dun-colored".  The association of donkeys with stupidity is a long-standing one, likely based on their perceived stubbornness.
