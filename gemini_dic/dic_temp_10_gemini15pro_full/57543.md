ETYMOLOGY->
From "drain" + "pipe".  "Drain" comes from the Old English *drēahnian, meaning "to strain" or "to filter," related to the Old Norse *draugr, meaning "dregs." "Pipe" comes from the Old French pipe, ultimately from the Latin pipare, meaning "to chirp" or "to peep," referring to the sound of a pipe instrument.  The combined term "drainpipe" refers to a pipe specifically designed for draining.
