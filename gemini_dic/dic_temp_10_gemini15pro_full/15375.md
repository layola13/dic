backtracking:/ˈbækˌtrækɪŋ/| n.|回溯，回溯法|The process of returning to a previous point or decision, especially in a computer program, when a dead end is reached, in order to try a different path.  This is often used in problem-solving and algorithms.|The maze was so complex that we had to resort to backtracking several times.|synonyms: regression, reversion, retraction|antonyms: progression, advance|noun
