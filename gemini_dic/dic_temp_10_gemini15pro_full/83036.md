"guong" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context, such as the language it's from or the sentence you saw it in, I can try to help you further.  However, since I cannot analyze a non-existent English word, I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "what".

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something.  It can also be used as an exclamation of surprise, anger, or disbelief. |
例句：What is your name? = 你叫什么名字？

例句：What a beautiful day! = 多么美好的一天！

近义词：which, how, who | 反义词: (No direct antonym for "what") |词性: pronoun, determiner, adverb
