dolichocephaly:/ˌdɒlɪkoʊˈsɛfəli/| n. | 长头畸形 | A condition in which the head is longer than would be expected, relative to its width.  It is characterized by a cephalic index (the ratio of the maximum width of the head to its maximum length) of less than 75. |  Dolichocephaly can be a normal variation, or it can be associated with certain genetic syndromes. 长头畸形可以是一种正常的变异，也可能与某些遗传综合征有关。| Example 1: The archaeologist discovered a skull exhibiting dolichocephaly in the ancient burial site. 考古学家在古代墓地发现了一个长头畸形的头骨。

Example 2:  Dolichocephaly is a common feature in some dog breeds, such as Greyhounds. 长头畸形是一些犬种（如灰狗）的常见特征。 | 近义词:long-headedness | 反义词:brachycephaly |词性:noun
