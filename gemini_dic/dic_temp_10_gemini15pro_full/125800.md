None. "Murkier" is not typically used in set phrases. It's grammatically correct to say things like "What's the murkier side of this issue?", but these aren't established phrases.  The base word "murky" however, can be found in phrases like "murky waters".


词源:
From Middle English *mirky, from Old English *mierce (“dark, murky”), from Proto-Germanic *merkjaz, from Proto-Indo-European *merk- (“dark”). Related to Dutch merk (“mark, sign”), German merken (“to notice, mark”).  The "-ier" suffix is a comparative adjective ending.
