macrodome:/ˈmækrədoʊm/| n. |大圆顶，宏观穹顶|A large dome-like structure, often used in mineralogy to describe a crystal form.  It refers to a crystal form composed of two faces that are symmetrically related and form a dome-like shape, but on a larger scale than a typical dome.|The macrodome on the mineral specimen was particularly well-developed.  该矿物标本上的大圆顶特别发达。|Synonyms: dome (in some contexts), crystal form|Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as it is a descriptive term for a crystal shape)|noun
