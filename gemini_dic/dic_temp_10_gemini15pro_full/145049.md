over the top = 过分；夸张

all over = 到处，遍及
over and over = 反复；再三
over time = 随着时间的推移

agitated about = 对…感到焦虑

词源:  "Over-" is an Old English prefix meaning "above, beyond, excessively." "Agitate" comes from the Latin "agitare," meaning "to set in motion, stir, rouse."  Therefore, "overagitate" literally means to stir or rouse excessively.
