词源:  "Nicotize" is derived from "nicotine," the addictive substance in tobacco.  The suffix "-ize" transforms the noun into a verb meaning "to affect with or like nicotine."  Therefore, the word literally means "to make addicted to nicotine," but its meaning has broadened to encompass addiction to other things as well.
