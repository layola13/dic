hamming:/ˈhæmɪŋ/| n.| 海明码，汉明码|A method for detecting and correcting errors in data transmission, named after Richard Hamming who invented it. It involves adding extra parity bits to the data which allow the receiver to detect and correct single-bit errors.|The data is protected by Hamming coding. 数据通过海明码进行保护。|近义词: error correction, error detection|反义词: N/A|noun


hamming distance:/ˈhæmɪŋ ˈdɪstəns/| n.| 海明距离|The number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different between two strings of equal length. It is used in coding theory and information theory.|The Hamming distance between "karolin" and "kathrin" is 3.  “karolin”和“kathrin”之间的海明距离是3。|近义词: edit distance (in some contexts)|反义词: N/A|noun
