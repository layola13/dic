词源:  "Low-down" originated in American English in the late 19th century.  "Low" refers to a base or morally degraded position, and "down" emphasizes the thoroughness of this degradation.  It initially meant "dishonorable" or "contemptible," later evolving to encompass the meaning of "inside information" or "the real facts."
