ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *accordingli*, from Old French *acordemment*, from *acordant* (“agreeing”) + *-ment* (suffix forming adverbs). *Acordant* is the present participle of *acorder* (“to agree”), from Vulgar Latin *accordāre*, from Latin *ad* (“to”) + *cor, cord-* (“heart”).

USAGE->

The adverb "accordingly" is used to connect a consequence to a reason. It's generally used at the beginning of a sentence or clause, followed by a comma. It doesn't modify a verb directly, but rather the whole sentence or clause.  It doesn't have specific tenses associated with it.

Example 1: The boss asked for the report by Friday, and I acted accordingly. = 老板要求周五前提交报告，我也照做了。

Example 2:  She found the recipe online and followed the instructions accordingly. = 她在网上找到了食谱，并按照说明操作。

Example 3:  The situation has changed, and we must adjust our plans accordingly. = 情况有变，我们必须相应地调整我们的计划。

Example 4:  He had been warned about the dangers, and he accordingly proceeded with caution. = 他已被警告过危险，因此他谨慎行事。

PHRASE->

"Accordingly" doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way that some other words do.  It's usually used standalone.  However, it can be used in conjunction with phrases that express reason or cause, such as:

1.  in accordance with:  He acted in accordance with the rules. = 他按照规则行事。 (This is a related phrase, but note the different meaning and grammatical function.)

2.  as a result: As a result of the storm, the game was cancelled, and we accordingly went home. = 由于暴风雨，比赛取消了，所以我们回家了。

3.  due to: Due to the heavy traffic, she was late, and accordingly missed the beginning of the meeting. = 由于交通拥堵，她迟到了，因此错过了会议的开始。

4.  given that: Given that the weather was poor, they accordingly decided to stay indoors. = 鉴于天气不好，他们决定待在室内。

5.  seeing as/since: Seeing as it was late, we accordingly decided to call it a night. = 既然已经晚了，我们决定结束这一晚。
