ETYMOLOGY->
From "accepted" + "-ly". "Accepted" comes from the Latin "acceptus," the past participle of "accipere," meaning "to receive."


USAGE->
This word is not commonly used in modern English.  While grammatically correct, it sounds formal and somewhat archaic.  It's often better to use more common adverbs like "generally," "commonly," or "widely."

Example 1:  It is acceptedly difficult to master a new language. =  掌握一门新的语言是公认的难事。

Example 2: Acceptedly, the Earth revolves around the Sun. =  地球绕着太阳转，这是公认的事实。


PHRASE->
This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  It is more often used in formal writing or technical contexts.  Instead of using phrases with "acceptedly," it's generally more natural to rephrase the sentence using more common synonyms. For example, instead of saying "acceptedly true," one might say "generally accepted as true."
