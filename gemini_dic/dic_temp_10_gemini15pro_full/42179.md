couldn't-care-less:/ˈkʊdnt ˈkɛər ˈlɛs/ | adj. |  漠不关心的，毫不在意的 |  Indicates a complete lack of interest or concern.  It's often used hyperbolically, meaning the speaker actually cares a little.  While grammatically "could care less" would imply some care exists, the phrase "couldn't care less" is the standard and accepted usage. | I couldn't care less about what he thinks. 我一点也不在乎他怎么想。 |  indifferent, apathetic, uninterested | concerned, interested | adjective


could-care-less (This spelling is less common and considered incorrect by some): /ˈkʊd ˈkɛər ˈlɛs/ | adj. | 漠不关心的，毫不在意的 (Technically implies some care exists, but often used interchangeably with "couldn't care less") |  This form is logically flawed, but commonly used in informal speech. It should technically mean that the speaker does care somewhat, but is often used with the same meaning as "couldn't care less". | He could care less about the outcome.  他不在乎结果。（尽管逻辑上存在问题，但这通常与"couldn't care less"意思相同）| indifferent, apathetic, uninterested | concerned, interested | adjective
