词源:
The origin of "dicky" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's related to "dicky-bird," a childish term for a bird, perhaps referencing the bird's breast.  Another connects it to the proper name Richard (Dick), though the connection is unclear.  The meaning of "unwell" or "unreliable" likely evolved later.
