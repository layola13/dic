PHRASE->
(Hart is rarely used in phrases.  It primarily functions as a standalone noun.)


词源:
From Middle English *hart, *herte, from Old English heorot (“hart, stag”), from Proto-Germanic *herutaz (“hart”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱer- (“horn; head”). Cognate with Dutch hert, German Hirsch, Old Norse hjǫrtr, Gothic 𐍀𐌰𐌹𐍂𐍄𐌰 (hairta).


注意事项:
While "hart" can technically refer to any male deer, it is most commonly used in a poetic or literary context when referring specifically to a red deer stag.  In everyday conversation, "stag" or "buck" are more common.
