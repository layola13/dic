monureid: /mɒnˈjʊrɪɪd/ | n. | 氮循环中的中间产物 |  A nitrogenous compound formed as an intermediate in the nitrogen cycle, specifically in the breakdown of urea. It is typically not stable and quickly converts to other compounds. | There is little information available on monureid's specific properties as it is a transient intermediate in a complex biological process.  | 近义词:  urea derivative | 反义词: None (due to its transient nature) | 词性: Noun
