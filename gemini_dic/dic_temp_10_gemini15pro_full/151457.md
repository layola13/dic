parorchis:/pærˈɔːrkɪs/| n. |并殖吸虫属|A genus of flukes (trematodes) that are parasitic in the intestines of birds and mammals.  These flukes have a complex life cycle involving multiple hosts, including snails and fish. |The researchers discovered a new species of *Parorchis* in the intestines of a seagull.|近义词:fluke, trematode|反义词: (No direct antonym for a genus.  One might consider "host" as a loose antonym, representing the organism the parasite lives in.)|noun
