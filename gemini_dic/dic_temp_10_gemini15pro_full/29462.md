catalyzed:/ˈkætəlaɪzd/| v. |催化的；被催化的|Caused or accelerated by a catalyst. |The reaction was catalyzed by an enzyme. 该反应是由一种酶催化的。|The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is catalyzed by manganese dioxide. 过氧化氢的分解是由二氧化锰催化的。|近义词:accelerated, facilitated, promoted|反义词:inhibited, retarded|词性:动词

词源: From the noun "catalyst" + "-ized" (suffix forming verbs meaning "to subject to the action of," "to make into," "to become like," etc.).  "Catalyst" comes from the Greek "katalysis," meaning "dissolution," from "kata-" (down, thoroughly) + "lyein" (to loosen).
