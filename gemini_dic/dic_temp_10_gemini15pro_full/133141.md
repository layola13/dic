Etymology:
"none" + "eternities"
"none" indicates negation or absence.
"eternities" refers to infinite or unending time.
The word is a neologism, meaning it's a relatively recently coined term.  It's formed by combining the negative prefix "non-" with the plural of "eternity."  This creates a word that emphasizes the finite and temporary nature of something.
