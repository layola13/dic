cotransducing:/ˌkoʊtrænsˈdjuːsɪŋ/ | adj. | 共转导的 | Transferring genes simultaneously.  Relating to or denoting two or more genes that are transferred together from one bacterium to another by transduction. | Cotransducing phages are valuable tools in genetic mapping. 共转导噬菌体是基因作图中的宝贵工具。 |  linked, co-transferred |  unlinked | adjective

Etymology:
co- (prefix) + transduce + -ing (suffix)
* co-: meaning "together," "jointly," "mutually," from Latin *com-* (cum "with").
* transduce: from Latin transducere "to lead across," from trans- "across" + ducere "to lead."
* -ing: present participle suffix, forming adjectives from verbs.
