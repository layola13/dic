macaronism: /ˈmækərənɪzəm/ | n. | 马卡龙主义，堆砌辞藻 | An affected or excessively ornate style of writing, characterized by the use of unusual or obsolete vocabulary, strange inversions, and other stylistic eccentricities, often to appear learned or sophisticated. | His writing was full of macaronism, making it difficult for the average reader to understand. 他的文章充满了马卡龙主义，让普通读者难以理解。 | 近义词：bombast, grandiloquence, purple prose | 反义词：simplicity, conciseness | 词性: noun

词源: From French *macaronisme*, from Italian *macaronesco* "macaronic (style)," from *macarone* "macaroni," perhaps ultimately from Greek *makaria* "blessed food, barley broth."  The connection is likely due to the perceived "crude mixture" of languages in macaronic verse, similar to the mixture of ingredients in macaroni.
