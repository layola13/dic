ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + sanguine + -ly.  "Over-" signifies "excessively" or "too much." "Sanguine" comes from Latin "sanguis" meaning "blood."  Historically, a sanguine temperament was associated with having an excess of blood, which was believed to lead to optimism and cheerfulness.  Thus, "oversanguine" denotes an excessive degree of this optimism.
