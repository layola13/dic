cycloidal:/saɪˈklɔɪdəl/
adj.
摆线的，圆形的
Relating to or resembling a cycloid.  A cycloid is the curve traced by a point on the rim of a circular wheel as the wheel rolls along a straight line.
The toy car followed a cycloidal path down the ramp.  玩具小车沿着斜坡走了一条摆线路径。

近义词:circular, rotating, rolling
反义词:linear, straight

词性:adjective (形容词)

词源: From Late Latin *cycloidalis,  from cycloideus (“cycloid”) + -alis (adjectival suffix).  Cycloideus comes from  Ancient Greek κύκλος (kúklos, “circle, wheel”) + -ειδής (-eidḗs, “-oid”).
