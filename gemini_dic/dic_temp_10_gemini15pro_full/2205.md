ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *adelian, frequentative of *adan "to be or become bad, sick," from Proto-Germanic *aþaljanan "to make or become noble, excellent," later "to deteriorate, become ill." This semantic shift is unusual but parallels the development of Latin *nobilitare "to ennoble," later "to make sick."  The original sense of "make noble" is preserved in the related word "atheling" (a noble youth).
