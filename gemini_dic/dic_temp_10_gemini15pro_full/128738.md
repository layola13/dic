ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *nigard*, from Old Norse *hnǫggr* ("stingy, parsimonious"), from Proto-Germanic *knukaz* ("tight, close"). Cognate with Middle Low German *niggard*, Middle Dutch *nicker* ("stingy person"), German *knorrig* ("gnarled, grumpy").  The negative connotations are a later development; originally, the word simply meant "frugal" or "thrifty."  Due to its phonetic similarity to a racial slur, the word has become largely taboo.
