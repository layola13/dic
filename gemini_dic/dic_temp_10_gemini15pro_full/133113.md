词源：  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "erudite" (adjective meaning "having or showing great knowledge or learning") + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality). "Erudite" comes from the Latin "eruditus," past participle of "erudire" ("to educate," "to instruct"), from "e-" ("out," "from") + "rudis" ("rough," "untrained").
