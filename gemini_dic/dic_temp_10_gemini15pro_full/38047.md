composability:/kəmˌpoʊzəˈbɪləti/| n.|可组合性，可复用性|The quality of being easily combined or integrated with other things, especially in a modular or flexible way.  It refers to the ability of independent components to be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.|Software components designed with composability in mind allow developers to create complex applications more efficiently.|近义词：modularity, flexibility, interoperability|反义词：inflexibility, rigidity|词性:noun

Etymology:
From compose (v.) + -ability.  Compose ultimately comes from Latin componere "to put together," from com- "together" + ponere "to put, place."
