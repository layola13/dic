ETYMOLOGY->

The precise origin of the word "flamenco" is uncertain. Several theories exist, including:

* Association with Flanders:  One theory suggests a connection to Flemish immigrants in Spain, perhaps because of their perceived flamboyant dress or behavior.
*  Flamingo:  The Spanish word for flamingo ("flamenco") shares the same spelling, and the bird's vibrant pink color and flamboyant movements might have led to an association with the passionate flamenco dance.
* "Flame-like":  The word might be related to the Spanish word "flama" (flame), referencing the fiery and passionate nature of the art form.
