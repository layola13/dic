literals:/ˈlɪtərəlz/| n.|字面量，文字，常量|A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. It is a value that is written directly into the program, rather than being stored in a variable. In simpler terms, it's a way to directly express a value within your code.  For example, in the expression `x = 5`, `5` is a literal.|例句：The number 5 in the code `x = 5` is a literal. 代码`x = 5`中的数字5是一个字面量。

例句：String literals are enclosed in quotes. 字符串字面量用引号括起来。|近义词：constant, value|反义词:variable|词性:noun
