ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *jeu parti* "divided game, game with even chances," from *jeu* "game" (from Latin *jocus*) + *parti* "divided" (from Latin *partitus*). The original sense in English was of "an even or balanced situation in a game." The modern sense of "danger" developed from the idea of being in a precarious or uncertain position.
