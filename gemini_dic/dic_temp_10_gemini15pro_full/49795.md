Etymology:
From Greek *dēmos* (δῆμος, “common people”) +  *-kratía* (-κρατία, "power, rule").  The "demon-" prefix evokes the sense of a malevolent or destructive force, similar to the use of "demon" in words like "demonic."  The term is a blend of "demon" and "democracy," suggesting a perversion of democratic principles.
