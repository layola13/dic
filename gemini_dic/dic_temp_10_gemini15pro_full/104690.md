karyostenosis:/ˌkærioʊstɪˈnoʊsɪs/| n. |核固缩，核浓缩|The shrinking and condensation of the cell nucleus, typically occurring during apoptosis (programmed cell death).  It is characterized by increased basophilia and a decrease in nuclear size.|The pathologist observed karyostenosis in the biopsied tissue, suggesting cellular apoptosis.|Synonyms: pyknosis, nuclear condensation|Antonyms: karyolysis|noun
