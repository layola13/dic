ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of "dogbox" likely comes from its literal meaning, a small box or house for a dog.  The extended meaning of a cramped and uncomfortable space arose from the association with the small size of a dog's kennel.  The use of "dogbox" to refer to a manual transmission is thought to be related to the H-pattern of the gear shift, which resembles the layout of some dog kennels.
