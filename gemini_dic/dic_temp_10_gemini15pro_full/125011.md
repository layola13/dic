Etymology:
From Mugwump + -ian.  "Mugwump" comes from the Algonquian (Natick) word *mugquomp*, meaning "important person, war leader."  In the 1880s, it was applied derisively to Republicans who bolted from the party to support Democratic presidential candidate Grover Cleveland.  The implication was that they considered themselves superior or too good for their party.
