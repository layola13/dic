词源: From Late Latin *confutare, from Latin confutare “to check, restrain, overcome,” from com- “together, completely” + -futare, related to fundere “to pour, melt.”  The original sense was "to cool by pouring water on," then "to quench, check, restrain."  The meaning shifted to "disprove" in Late Latin.
