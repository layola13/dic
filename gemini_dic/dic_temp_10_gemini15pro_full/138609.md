注意事项:
Since "nucin" isn't a widely used term, its pronunciation might vary slightly depending on the context or individual.  "Kernel" or "core" are often used as more common synonyms.  There's also no established antonym for "nucin."  The suggested antonyms relate to the outer part of a nut, contrasting with the inner "nucin."
