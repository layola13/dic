注意事项：
"Bunga" primarily appears in Malay and Indonesian, and while it can be understood in some other Southeast Asian contexts, it's not a common word in English.  Its usage in English is generally limited to those familiar with Malay/Indonesian or within specific contexts like discussions of Southeast Asian finance or flora.
