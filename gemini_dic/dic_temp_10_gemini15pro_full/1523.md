acetylenes:/əˈsɛtɪliːnz/
noun
乙炔，炔烃
Any of a class of unsaturated hydrocarbons having a triple carbon-carbon bond.  The simplest example is ethyne (C2H2), also called acetylene.
Acetylenes are highly reactive and used in various chemical processes and industrial applications.
例句：Acetylenes are commonly used in welding and cutting torches. 乙炔常用于焊接和切割炬中。

例句：The reaction produced a mixture of acetylenes. 该反应产生了一种炔烃的混合物。

近义词:alkynes
反义词:alkenes, alkanes
词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From acetyl + -ene (suffix denoting unsaturated hydrocarbons). Ultimately from Latin acetum ("vinegar") + Greek hyle ("wood, matter").


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Acetylenes are important in organic chemistry. = 炔烃在有机化学中很重要。
