词源:  "Kitty-corner" has a somewhat obscure etymology. One theory suggests it's a corruption of the phrase "cater-cornered," which itself possibly derives from the French "quatre," meaning four, referring to the four corners of an intersection.  Another theory connects it to the archaic word "cat," meaning oblique or askew.  The "kitty" form likely arose through folk etymology.
