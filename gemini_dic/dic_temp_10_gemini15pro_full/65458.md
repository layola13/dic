eurite: /ˈjʊəraɪt/
n.
轴突; 神经突
A slender threadlike process extending from a nerve cell.  A neurite refers to any projection from the cell body of a neuron. This projection can be either an axon or a dendrite.
The researchers observed the growth of neurites in the cell culture.  研究人员观察了细胞培养物中神经突的生长。
近义词: axon, nerve fiber
反义词: (No direct antonym for a physical structure like a neurite)
词性: noun
