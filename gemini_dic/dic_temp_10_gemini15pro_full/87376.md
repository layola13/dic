注意事项：

* "heros" is a misspelling. The correct plural of "hero" is "heroes."  This entire analysis uses the correct spelling "heroes."
* While "champions," "idols," and "legends" are close in meaning, they are not perfect synonyms.  A "hero" implies courage and nobility, while these other terms may not.  Similarly, "villains" and "cowards" are antonyms in a narrative sense but don't fully capture the opposite of "hero" in all contexts.
