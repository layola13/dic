ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *loweren*, *louren*, from Old English *hūrian* (“to lower, let down, humiliate”), from Proto-Germanic *hūrijaną* (“to lower, let down”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱer-*, *ḱerh₂-* (“to bend down, turn”). Cognate with Old Frisian *huria* (“to lower”), Dutch *hurken* (“to crouch”), German *huren* (“to fornicate”).  The meaning "to frown" may be influenced by Middle Dutch *luren* (“to frown, leer”).
