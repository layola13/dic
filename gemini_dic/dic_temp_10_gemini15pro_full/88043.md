Etymology->
"High" and "end" are both native English words with Germanic roots.  "High" relates to elevation and has been used to denote superior quality since Old English. "End" refers to the extremity or furthest point, and in this context, implies the top of a scale or range.  The compound "high-end" emerged in the mid-20th century, likely in the context of consumer goods and technology.
