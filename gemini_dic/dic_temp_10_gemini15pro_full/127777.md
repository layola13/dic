词源:  From Middle English *neif*, variant of *naif*, from Old French *naïf*, masculine, and *naïve*, feminine, "natural, native, ingenuous," from Latin *nativus* "born, innate," from *nasci* "to be born."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe someone who is unaffectedly simple or lacking in worldly wisdom, sometimes to the point of being foolish.
