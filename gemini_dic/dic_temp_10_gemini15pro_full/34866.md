clinostat:/ˈklaɪnəstæt/ /ˈklɪnəˌstæt/ | n. | 旋转器，临床旋转器 | A device used to negate the effects of gravity on plant growth, usually by slowly rotating plants so that each side is equally exposed to gravity. | The scientists used a clinostat to study the growth of roots in a microgravity environment. 科学家们使用旋转器来研究微重力环境下根的生长。

The clinostat rotated slowly, ensuring even exposure to light. 旋转器缓慢旋转，确保均匀受光。 | 近义词: rotating apparatus, gravity compensator | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "stationary platform" in a specific context) | 词性: noun


Etymology: From Greek *klīnō*  (I bend, incline) + *statos* (stationary).
