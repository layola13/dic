词源： "aify" is a neologism (a newly coined word) formed by combining "AI" (artificial intelligence) with the suffix "-ify," meaning "to make or cause to be."  The suffix "-ify" is commonly used to create verbs that describe transformations, such as "simplify," "purify," and "classify." This construction suggests the process of transforming something by incorporating or applying artificial intelligence.  It's not a word with a long historical etymology, but rather a product of recent technological advancements.
