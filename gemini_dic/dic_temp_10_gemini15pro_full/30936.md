词源： "chairmanned" comes from "chairman" + "-ed." "Chairman" itself originated from "chair" (referring to the seat of authority) + "man."  While "chairman" has become less common due to its gendered nature, "chairmanned" retains the same structure.  More inclusive alternatives for the verb form include "chaired" and "presided over."
