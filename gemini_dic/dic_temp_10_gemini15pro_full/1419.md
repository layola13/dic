ETYMOLOGY->
From accustomed + -ness.  Accustomed itself comes from the past participle of the verb accustom, which is derived from the Old French acostumer, ultimately from Latin consuetudin-, consuetudo "custom, habit," from consuescere "to accustom," from com- "together" + suescere "to become used to."


USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and considered archaic or even obsolete.  It's highly unlikely you would encounter it in modern English.  Using "accustomedness" would sound unnatural and overly formal.  Prefer using synonyms like "habituation," "familiarity," or "custom."  Therefore, providing usage examples in various tenses is not practically useful, as the word itself is not commonly used.

It's better to avoid using this word in contemporary English.  If you absolutely must use it in a sentence for a specific stylistic purpose (e.g., to create an archaic feel in a historical novel), simply ensure the subject and verb agree:

The accustomednesses of the local tribes were fascinating to the anthropologist. = 当地部落的习惯让这位人类学家很着迷。

His accustomednesses to the rigors of military life served him well. = 他对军队生活严酷的适应性对他很有帮助。

PHRASE->
Due to its rarity, "accustomednesses" does not have common phrases associated with it.  It's better to use phrases with its synonyms:

* be accustomed to: 习惯于
* become accustomed to: 逐渐习惯于
* get accustomed to:  适应于
* grow accustomed to: 越来越习惯于
* in the accustomed manner: 以惯常的方式
