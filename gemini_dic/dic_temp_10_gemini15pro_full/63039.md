ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *enravir*, from en- (“in, into”) + ravir (“to ravish, to seize, to carry away”), from Latin rapere (“to seize, to carry off”).  The original meaning was "to carry away with joy," reflecting the Latin root.  Over time, the meaning shifted to focus on the intense joy and delight rather than the physical act of carrying away.
