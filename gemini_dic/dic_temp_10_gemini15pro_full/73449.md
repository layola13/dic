forendihaz is not a recognized English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to analyze it for you.


If you're interested in learning about word formation and etymology, I can offer some general information about how new words enter the English language:

* **Borrowing:**  English frequently adopts words from other languages. Examples include "taco" (Spanish), "karaoke" (Japanese), and "safari" (Swahili).
* **Compounding:** Two existing words are combined to create a new word. Examples include "firefly," "keyboard," and "watermelon."
* **Derivation:** A new word is created by adding prefixes or suffixes to an existing word. Examples include "unhappy" (prefix "un-" added to "happy"), "quickly" (suffix "-ly" added to "quick"), and "nationalization" (suffix "-ization" added to "national").
* **Back-formation:**  A shorter word is created from a longer word, often by removing what appears to be a suffix.  For example, "edit" was back-formed from "editor."
* **Acronyms and initialisms:** New words are formed from the initial letters of multiple words. Examples include "laser" (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and "NATO" (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).
* **Blending:** Parts of two words are combined to create a new word. Examples include "smog" (smoke + fog) and "brunch" (breakfast + lunch).
* **Neologisms:**  Entirely new words are created, sometimes through creative invention or as slang.
