PHRASE-> (Given the infrequent use of "arrayment," phrases are difficult to construct naturally. These examples use the more common verb "array.")
array oneself in = 穿上，打扮成
array against = 对...进行排列；使对抗
array oneself for battle = 准备战斗


注意事项:

While "arrayment" is a valid word, it's archaic and rarely used in modern English.  The verb "array" and the noun "arrangement" are far more common and preferable in most contexts.  Therefore, many of the examples above use "array" and its various forms instead of "arrayment" to provide more natural-sounding sentences.  Using "arrayment" often leads to awkward phrasing.
