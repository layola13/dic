注意事项:

"bloatedness's" itself is grammatically unusual.  While possessive forms are possible with nouns, they are rare with abstract nouns like "bloatedness."  It would be more natural to say "the discomfort *of* bloatedness" or "the pain *caused by* bloatedness."  I have followed your instructions and provided examples using "bloatedness's," but please be aware that native speakers would generally avoid this construction.
