hypothenuse:/haɪˈpɒtənjuːs/ (US) /haɪˈpɒtənjuːz/ (UK)| n.|斜边|The longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle. |The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.|近义词:long side (informal)|反义词:leg, cathetus|词性:noun

Etymology->
From Late Latin *hypotenusa, from Ancient Greek ὑποτείνουσα (hupoteinousa, “stretching under [the right angle]”), present participle feminine of  ὑποτείνω (hupoteinō, “I stretch or extend under”), from ὑπό (hupó, “under”) + τείνω (teinō, “I stretch”).
