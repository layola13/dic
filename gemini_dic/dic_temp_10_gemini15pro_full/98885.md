The word "inteneration" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  It could be confused with "interpretation," "integration," or "generation."  Since the intended word is unclear, I will analyze "interpretation" as it seems the closest possibility.


interpretation: /ɪnˌtɜːrprɪˈteɪʃn/ | n. | 解释，阐释，理解 |  The act of explaining, translating, or understanding something in a particular way. |  Her interpretation of the poem was very different from mine. 她对这首诗的理解与我的截然不同。|  The musician's interpretation of the piece was breathtaking.  这位音乐家对这首作品的演绎令人叹为观止。| synonyms: explanation, elucidation, understanding, rendition, analysis | antonyms: misinterpretation, distortion, misreading | noun
