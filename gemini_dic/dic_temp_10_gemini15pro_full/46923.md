"Darlinger" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a surname), a newly coined word, or specific to a certain dialect or niche community.  Therefore, providing a standard lexical analysis is impossible.

If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer a more specific explanation.  For example, knowing the source (a book, a website, a conversation) could help determine its intended meaning.
