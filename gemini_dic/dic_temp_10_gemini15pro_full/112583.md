lovery: /ˈlʌvəri/ | n. | 爱人; 情人; 恋人 (non-standard) |  A term of endearment, similar to "lover," but often considered childish or dialectal.  It is not a standard English word and is rarely used in formal contexts. |  "He called her his 'lovery.'" 他称她为他的“爱人”。(This example demonstrates the informal and somewhat childish usage.)| 近义词: lover, sweetheart, darling, beloved | 反义词: enemy, foe | 词性: noun

词源:  Likely a diminutive form of "lover," formed by adding the suffix "-ery," which can be used to form nouns denoting a place or state associated with something (e.g., bakery, fishery).  However, its usage is not widespread enough to have a definitive etymology documented in major dictionaries.
