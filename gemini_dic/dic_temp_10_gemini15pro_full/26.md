ETYMOLOGY->
"Color" in this context historically referred to skin color different from white Europeans.  The phrase gained prominence during periods of racial segregation and discrimination.  While once used with the intention of being inclusive of non-white individuals, it has become problematic due to its vagueness and the implication that "white" is the default or standard race.

USAGE->
This term is generally avoided in modern usage due to its potential to cause offense.  It's preferable to use more specific and respectful terms that reflect an individual's specific racial or ethnic background.  If referring to historical contexts where the term was commonly used, it's important to acknowledge its problematic nature.

Example 1:  Historical documents sometimes referred to "men of color" as a group distinct from white men.  (历史文献中有时将“有色人种男性”作为一个不同于白人男性的群体来指代。)
Example 2: The term "a man of color" was used in the 19th century, but it's no longer considered appropriate. (19世纪曾使用“有色人种男性”这个词，但现在它已不再被认为是合适的。)


PHRASE->
This term is not typically used in phrases.  It's more common to see phrases using more specific racial or ethnic designations.  For example, instead of "rights of men of color," one would say "rights of Black men," "rights of Asian men," etc., depending on the specific group being referred to.
