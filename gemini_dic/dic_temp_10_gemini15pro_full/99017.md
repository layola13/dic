interadditive:/ˌɪntərˈædɪtɪv/ | adj. | 相互加性的，互加的 |  Relating to or involving the addition of separate parts or elements, where the combined effect is equal to the sum of the individual effects.  It implies a simple, linear relationship between the parts and the whole. | The effects of the two drugs were interadditive, meaning the combined effect was simply the sum of the individual effects. 这两种药物的作用是相互加性的，意味着其联合作用仅仅是各自作用的总和。|  additive, cumulative | antagonistic, synergistic | adjective
