The word "kelmer" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It doesn't appear to have a common etymology or established usage. It's possible it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, a proper noun, or even a neologism (newly coined word).  Without more context, it's impossible to provide a meaningful analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, or what you believe it might mean, I can try to offer further assistance.
