overfitting:/ˌoʊvərˈfɪtɪŋ/| n.|过拟合|A phenomenon in statistics and machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This results in excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data.|The complex model showed signs of overfitting, performing perfectly on the training set but poorly on the test set. 该复杂模型显示出过拟合的迹象，在训练集上表现完美，但在测试集上表现很差。|近义词：overtraining|反义词: underfitting|词性: noun

overfit:/ˌoʊvərˈfɪt/| v. |过拟合|To train a statistical model to such an extent that it captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor generalization to new data.|The data scientist realized he had overfit the model and needed to simplify it.  数据科学家意识到他已经过拟合了模型，需要简化它。|近义词：overtrain|反义词: underfit|词性: verb
