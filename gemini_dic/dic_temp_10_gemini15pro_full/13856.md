augite:/ˈɔːdʒaɪt/| n. |普通辉石|A common rock-forming mineral of the pyroxene group, usually black, greenish-black, or dark green in color. It is a single-chain inosilicate containing calcium, sodium, magnesium, iron, aluminum, and titanium. |The geologist identified the dark crystals in the volcanic rock as augite.  地质学家将火山岩中的黑色晶体鉴定为普通辉石。

Augite is a major component of basalt. 普通辉石是玄武岩的主要成分。|近义词：pyroxene, diopside|反义词: None|词性:noun
