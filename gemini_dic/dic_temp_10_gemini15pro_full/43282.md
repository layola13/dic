Etymology:
craft (n.) Old English cræft "strength, skill, power, art," from Proto-Germanic *kraftiz (source also of Old High German kraft "strength, power," Old Norse kraptr "strength, might, virtue," Gothic krafts "strength"). The meaning shifted in Middle English from "physical strength" to "skill, dexterity," then to "art, trade, occupation requiring special skill."
master (n.) Old English mægester "one having control or authority," also "teacher, scholar," from West Germanic *maistra- (source also of Old Frisian meister "master," Dutch meester, German Meister), from Latin magister (n.) "chief, head, director, teacher," literally "he who is greater," from magis (adv.) "more," from PIE root *meg- "great."
