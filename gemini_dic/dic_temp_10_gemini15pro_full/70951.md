ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fȳrflēoma (attested only as fyrflēoma "fire-flame"), from fȳr "fire" + flēoma "flame."  "Fire" comes from Proto-Germanic *fūr- (source also of Old Saxon fiur, Old Frisian fiur, Old Norse fýr, Dutch vuur, German Feuer, Gothic fōn "fire"), from Proto-Indo-European *pūr- (source also of Sanskrit pū́rvaḥ "prior, eastern," Latin pūrus "pure," Russian пыл pyl "dust, ardor"). "Flame" comes from Old English flēoma "flight," also "stream of fire," from Proto-Germanic *flaumaz, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *pleu- "to flow."
