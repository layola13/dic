PHRASE->
(Since "ferme" is a relatively uncommon word in English, phrases using it are limited and generally confined to French contexts.)


注意事项:
As noted above, while "ferme" exists as a French word borrowed into English, its usage, especially as a verb, is uncommon and often replaced by more common English equivalents like "closed," "shut," "firm," or "farm."  It's important to be mindful of context and audience when using this word.
