The word "deliciate" doesn't exist in standard English.  The closest words are "delicate" and "delicious."  I'll analyze both.

**Delicate:**

/ˈdɛlɪkət/ | adj. | 精致的；微妙的；易碎的；脆弱的 | Easily broken or damaged; finely made; needing careful treatment; a subtle difference | The delicate flowers wilted in the heat.  这些娇嫩的花朵在高温下枯萎了。 | fragile, frail, subtle, dainty | robust, strong, coarse | adjective


/ˈdɛlɪkət/ | adj. | 美味的；可口的 (This meaning is less common, and usually refers to a subtle and refined flavor) | Having a subtle and pleasant taste or smell. | The wine had a delicate, fruity aroma. 这酒有一种精致的水果香味。| subtle, refined, exquisite | strong, overpowering, coarse | adjective


**Delicious:**

/dɪˈlɪʃəs/ | adj. | 美味的；可口的 |  Highly pleasing to the taste or smell. | The cake was absolutely delicious.  蛋糕非常美味。 | tasty, yummy, savory, palatable | unappetizing, disgusting, unpleasant | adjective


**Etymology (Delicate):**

From Late Middle English *delicat*, from Old French *delicat*, from Latin *dēlicātus* "alluring, charming, delightful, luxurious, dainty," past participle of *dēlicāre* "to entice, allure," from *dēliciae* "pleasures, delights."

**Etymology (Delicious):**

From Middle English *delicious*, from Old French *delicieus*, from Latin *dēliciōsus* "delightful, charming," from *dēliciae* "pleasures, delights."
