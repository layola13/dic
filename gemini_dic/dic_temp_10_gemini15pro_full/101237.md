Etymology:
From inviting + -ness.  Inviting itself comes from the verb invite, which traces back through Middle English inviten to Old French inviter, ultimately from Latin invitare "to invite, summon, entertain," from in- "in" + votare "to vow, promise, dedicate."  The suffix -ness forms nouns expressing a state or quality.
