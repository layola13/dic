ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek "pathos" (πάθος) meaning "suffering" or "experience," via Late Latin "patheticus," and then through French "pathétique."  "Hetic" appears as a variant, potentially influenced by words like "hectic" (though different in meaning) and sharing a sense of emotional intensity.
