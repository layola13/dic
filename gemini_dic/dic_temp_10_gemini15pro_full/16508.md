注意事项:

*  "Barish" is primarily used in South Asia, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.  It's not a standard English word but rather a loanword from Hindi and Urdu. In standard English, "rain" is the more common term.
* The word "barish" itself does not change form to indicate tense or number.  Tense is conveyed through the verbs used in the sentence.
