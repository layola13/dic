ETYMOLOGY->
From illusion + -istic.
"illusion" comes from Late Latin illusio "a mocking," from Latin illudere "to mock, play upon," from assimilated form of in- "on, upon" (from PIE root *en "in") + ludere "to play" (from PIE root *leid- "to play").
"-istic" is a suffix forming adjectives from other adjectives or nouns, meaning "of or pertaining to," "having the character or form of," "in accordance with," "practicing."
