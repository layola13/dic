词源：
"Badass" is American slang that originated in the late 1960s or early 1970s. It's a compound word formed from "bad" and "ass."  "Bad" in this context meaning "tough" or "rebellious" and "ass" referring to a donkey or a person's buttocks.  It initially carried negative connotations of rebelliousness and aggression but has evolved to also encompass positive qualities like competence and coolness.
