"Behete" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a regional dialect word, slang, or a newly coined term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered the word, or if you meant a different word, I can try to offer a more helpful response.


However, given the request to demonstrate the format with the word "what," I can provide that analysis:


what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something.  | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which (in some contexts)
