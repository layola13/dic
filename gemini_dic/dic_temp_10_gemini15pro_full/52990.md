词源:

Australian slang, probably from a dialect word in the English Midlands, *dinkum*, meaning ‘work’, ‘hard work’, ‘proper’, which in turn is probably from a now obsolete word, *dincum*, meaning ‘valuable’, ‘of good quality’.


注意事项:  This word is primarily used in Australian English. While understood elsewhere, it carries a distinctly Australian flavor.
