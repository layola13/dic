词源:  "Flyabilities" is a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "fly" (verb, meaning to move through the air using wings) and "abilities" (noun, meaning the power or skill to do something). It reflects the emerging field of drone technology and the focus on their aerial maneuvering capabilities.
