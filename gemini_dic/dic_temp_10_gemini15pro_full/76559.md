词源：
From Old French *galerie, from Medieval Latin galeria "long portico, colonnade, gallery," from galilea "Galilee," name of a porch or chapel in certain churches. The sense transfer likely happened because a particular galilea porch at the basilica of Saint Sepulchre in Jerusalem was used to display relics.  来自古法语 *galerie，源自中世纪拉丁语 galeria “长门廊、柱廊、走廊”，源自 galilea “加利利”，某些教堂中门廊或小教堂的名称。意义的转移可能是因为耶路撒冷圣墓教堂的一个特定的加利利门廊被用来展示文物。
