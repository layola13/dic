PHRASE->
There's no phrase specifically using "missend," as it's a relatively uncommon word.  It's generally used directly in a sentence explaining the action of sending something incorrectly.  However, you could construct phrases like:

accidentally missend 意外错发
frequently missend 经常错发
rarely missend 很少错发
intentionally missend 故意错发 (though this would likely be described with a more specific verb like "misdirect")


词源:  "missend" is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrong or bad) and the verb "send."  The prefix "mis-" has Old English and Germanic origins.
