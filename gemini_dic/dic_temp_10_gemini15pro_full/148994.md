ovoviviparism:/ˌōvōvɪvɪˈpɑːrɪzəm/ | n. | 卵胎生 | A mode of reproduction in which embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother's body until they hatch. The embryos are nourished by the yolk of the egg, not by the mother directly. | Example 1:  Guppies exhibit ovoviviparism, giving birth to live young. 孔雀鱼展现了卵胎生的繁殖方式，产下活的幼鱼。

Example 2: Some snakes and lizards practice ovoviviparism. 一些蛇和蜥蜴采用卵胎生的繁殖方式。 | 近义词: aplacental viviparity | 反义词: oviparity, viviparity | 词性: noun
