aeroengine:/ˈɛroʊˌɛndʒɪn/| n.|航空发动机|A type of engine used to power aircraft, typically a jet engine or a propeller engine.|The aeroengine failed mid-flight, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. 航空发动机在飞行途中发生故障，迫使飞行员紧急着陆。

The new aeroengine is more fuel-efficient than the older models.  新的航空发动机比旧型号更省油。|近义词：aircraft engine, jet engine, turbine engine|反义词: N/A|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From aero- (prefix meaning "air" or "aircraft") + engine. "Aero-" comes from the Greek word "aer" meaning "air".


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The aeroengine powers the aircraft efficiently. = 这台航空发动机为飞机提供高效动力。
This type of aeroengine requires regular maintenance. = 这种航空发动机需要定期维护。


一般过去时:
The aeroengine failed during the test flight. = 航空发动机在试飞期间发生故障。
The engineers redesigned the aeroengine to improve its performance. = 工程师们重新设计了航空发动机以提高其性能。


现在完成时:
The airline has replaced the old aeroengines with newer models. = 该航空公司已经用新型号替换了旧的航空发动机。
The mechanics have inspected the aeroengine thoroughly. = 机械师们彻底检查了航空发动机。


过去完成时:
The pilot had shut down the aeroengine before the emergency landing. = 飞行员在紧急着陆前关闭了航空发动机。
