PHRASE->

(Due to the nature of the word "direness," it doesn't lend itself to common phrases in the same way as more versatile words.  It's typically used directly to describe the severity of a situation.  Therefore, providing typical phrases is difficult. Instead, I'll provide examples of how the word might be used in slightly longer expressions.)

The report underscored the sheer direness of the situation.  该报告强调了情况的绝对严重性。
