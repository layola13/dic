The word "komenic" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I can try to offer more specific information.

However, assuming you meant "**common**," here's the breakdown:

common: /ˈkɒmən/ (UK) /ˈkɑːmən/ (US) | adj. n.| 常见的，普通的；共同的；公地 | Something that is common happens often or is seen or found in many places. A common is an area of land that belongs to or is shared by the people who live there. |  例句：Colds are common in winter. 感冒在冬天很常见。 | 近义词：usual, frequent, ordinary, shared, public | 反义词：rare, unusual, uncommon, private | 词性: adjective, noun
