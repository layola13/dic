The word "newan" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe it means, I may be able to offer more assistance.  For example, perhaps you meant "New One"?  Or maybe it's a technical term used in a specific field.


However, since the prompt requests demonstrations of various grammatical concepts using "what," I can provide that information.  Please note that I am substituting "what" for the non-existent word "newan" in these examples.
