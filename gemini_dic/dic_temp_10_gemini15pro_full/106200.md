knolliest: /ˈnɒliɪst/ | adj. | 多节的，疙瘩多的，最博学的 | Having the most or very prominent knols; most knowledgeable. |  The knolliest tree in the forest was also the oldest. 森林里节疤最多的树也是最古老的。 | gnarliest, knottiest, most learned, most erudite | smoothest, least knowledgeable | adjective

Etymology:  From *knolly* (having knols) + *-est* (superlative suffix). *Knolly* is likely derived from *knol*, meaning "a rounded protuberance; a knob," with the addition of the adjective-forming suffix *-y*.  The word "knol" itself has its roots in Old English *cnoll*, meaning "hilltop, summit," and is related to Old Norse *knollr* and German *Knolle*.  The superlative suffix *-est* is a common Germanic suffix used to form the superlative degree of adjectives.
