The word "eakas" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a name, I could help you find information about the person or place. If it's from another language, I might be able to translate it.

Since I cannot analyze "eakas," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Example: What color is the sky? 天空是什么颜色的？ | Synonyms: which, how, why | Antonyms: (No direct antonyms for "what") | Part of Speech: pronoun, determiner, adverb
