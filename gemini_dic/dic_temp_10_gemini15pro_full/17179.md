The word "batule" doesn't appear to be a valid word in English or in any commonly recognized language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  It's possible there's a misspelling, it's a technical term in a very specialized field, a proper noun, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context, like where you encountered the word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requested examples of various grammatical structures using "what," I'll provide those below.  Please replace "what" with a valid word or phrase relevant to your situation to make these examples meaningful.

what /wɒt; hwɒt/ |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ |which, who | nothing

what /wɒt; hwɒt/ |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | What do you want? 你想要什么？| which, who | nothing
