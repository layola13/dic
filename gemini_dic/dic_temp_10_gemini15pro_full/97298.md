PHRASE->
Currently, there are no widely established phrases using "infold".  "Infold" is more of a literary or formal word and isn't commonly used in everyday phrases.



词源：From in- + fold.  The "in-" prefix indicates inward direction or inclusion, while "fold" refers to the act of bending something over on itself.  Thus, "infold" literally means "to fold inward."
