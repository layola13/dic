Etymology:

* non- (prefix):  From Latin *nōn* "not".
* farcical (adjective): From *farce* (noun), from Old French *farce* "stuffing, forcemeat," from *farcir* "to stuff," ultimately from Latin *farcire* "to stuff." The meaning shifted from stuffing to comic interludes in plays, and eventually to broad comedy.
* -ly (suffix):  Forms adverbs from adjectives.
