PHRASE->

注意事项：

"Locoes" itself is not a common word in modern English.  "Lotio" (singular) and "lotion" are much more frequently used. While "locoes" is grammatically correct as a plural of "lotio," it might sound archaic or overly formal in everyday conversation.  Consider using "lotions" instead.
