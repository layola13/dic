gating:/ˈɡeɪtɪŋ/ | n. | 门控，选通，控制 | The process of controlling the flow of something, often signals or information. |  Example: The gating of ion channels is essential for nerve function. 离子通道的门控对神经功能至关重要。

| Example:  Logic gating controls the flow of data in computers. 逻辑门控控制计算机中的数据流。 | Synonyms: controlling, regulating, modulating | Antonyms: opening, releasing, freeing | Noun

gating:/ˈɡeɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 门控的，选通的 | Relating to or involving a gate or gating. | Example: Gating circuits are used in electronics. 门控电路用于电子学。

| Example: The gating mechanism of the channel was studied. 通道门控机制被研究。| Synonyms: controlled, regulated | Antonyms: uncontrolled, unregulated | Adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From "gate" + "-ing" suffix.  "Gate" comes from Old English "geat" and Old Norse "gat," meaning "opening, passage." The "-ing" suffix forms a noun or adjective from a verb, in this case, implying the action or process of using a gate or a gate-like mechanism.
