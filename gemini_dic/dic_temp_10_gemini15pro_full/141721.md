词源:  "Oragious" is likely a  non-standard or archaic variant of "outrageous", potentially influenced by words like "orage" (a violent storm, especially one with thunder and lightning).  There's no established etymology for "oragious" as a distinct word.  It's possible it's a dialectical variation or a misspelling. It's recommended to use the standard word "outrageous" or other synonyms like "furious," "enraged," or "tempestuous" instead.
