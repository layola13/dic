词源:  The phrase "matter of fact" originated in the 16th century, evolving from the legal phrase "in point of fact."  Over time, it transitioned into common usage, losing its strictly legal connotation. The adverbial form, "matter-of-factly," emerged later, likely in the 18th or 19th century, as a natural extension of the adjective.
