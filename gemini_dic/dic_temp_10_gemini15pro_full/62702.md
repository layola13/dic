From Middle English engin, from Old French engin, from Latin ingenium (“natural disposition, talent, intelligence, ingenuity; an invention, device”), from in- (“in, within”) + gignere (“to beget, produce”).  The meaning shifted from "cleverness" to "machines made by clever people" to "the making of such machines" to "the profession of designing such machines".
