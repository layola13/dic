The word "marada" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It may be a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing), or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, if it's a name, I could help you find its origin or meaning.  If it's from a specific dialect or language, I can direct you to appropriate resources.
