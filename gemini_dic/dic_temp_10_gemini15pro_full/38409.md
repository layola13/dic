词源:  From the adjective "concerned" + the adverbial suffix "-ly."  "Concerned" comes from the past participle of the verb "concern," which ultimately derives from the Latin "concernere," meaning "to mix together, to sift."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the idea of being involved or interested in something, and ultimately to feeling anxiety or worry.
