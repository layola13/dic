Etymology:
From Late Middle English *competrice, from Old French competit-, the stem of the present participle of competir (“to compete”), from Latin competere (“to coincide, agree, suit, come together, compete”), from com- (“together”) + petere (“to strive for, seek”).  The -ess suffix is used to form feminine nouns.
