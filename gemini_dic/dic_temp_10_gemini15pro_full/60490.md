The word "ekara" does not appear to be a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It may be a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it comes from or where you encountered it, I might be able to offer more assistance.

Since I cannot analyze "ekara," I will use the word "what" as an example to demonstrate the requested format.
