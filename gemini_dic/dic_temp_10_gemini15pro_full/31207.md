PHRASE->
(Since "changu" is a fairly specific noun borrowed from another language, common English phrases don't typically incorporate it.  Therefore, creating natural-sounding phrases is difficult and might feel forced.  Instead, I'll provide examples of how you *could* use it in a phrase-like structure within a sentence)
