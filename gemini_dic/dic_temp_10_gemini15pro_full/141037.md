"Onlan" is not a recognized English word.  It is possible that it is a misspelling, a slang term, a newly coined word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, is it a technical term, a name, or part of a larger phrase?

However, I can still demonstrate the requested format using the word "what" since you provided example sentences using that word.
