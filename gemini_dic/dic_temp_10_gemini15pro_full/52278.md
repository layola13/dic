dichogamy:/daɪˈkɒɡəmi/ | n. | 雌雄异熟 | The condition in which the male and female reproductive organs of a flower mature at different times, preventing self-fertilization. |  Dichogamy is a common strategy in plants to promote outcrossing. 雌雄异熟是植物促进异交的常见策略。

Dichogamy can manifest as either protandry or protogyny. 雌雄异熟可以表现为雄蕊先熟或雌蕊先熟。 | 近义词: heterogamy | 反义词: homogamy | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Greek dikho- "in two, apart" + gamos "marriage"
