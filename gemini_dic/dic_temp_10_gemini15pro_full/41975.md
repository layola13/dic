PHRASE->
(Due to the specialized nature of the word "cossic," commonly used phrases are limited.  It's more likely to be found within mathematical expressions and technical contexts.)

cossic function 余弦函数
cossic value 余弦值
cossic angle 余弦角
cossic identity  余弦恒等式
cossic curve 余弦曲线


注意事项:

"cossic"虽然存在，但是不如"cosine"常用。"cosine"是更常见的表达方式。
