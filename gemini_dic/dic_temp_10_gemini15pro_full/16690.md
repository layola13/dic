barretter:/ˈbærɪtər/| n.|镇流器，巴雷特稳流电阻|A barretter is an electrical component used to maintain a constant current in a circuit.  It is a type of resistor with a positive temperature coefficient, meaning its resistance increases as its temperature increases. This characteristic allows it to compensate for variations in voltage and maintain a stable current.|The barretter in the circuit prevented fluctuations in current.  电路中的镇流器防止了电流波动。|Synonyms: ballast resistor, current regulator|Antonyms: N/A|noun
