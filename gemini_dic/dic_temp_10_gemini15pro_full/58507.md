词源：From Spanish *duelo*, from Latin *dŏlŭs* (“pain, grief”).

注意事项：While *duelo* primarily means "duel" in Spanish, it can also mean "mourning" or "grief." The Anglicized pronunciation is often used when referring to the concept of mourning, especially in musical contexts (e.g., "duelo music").  While "duel" is the more common English word for a fight, "duelo" sometimes appears in English, often maintaining its Spanish flavor.
