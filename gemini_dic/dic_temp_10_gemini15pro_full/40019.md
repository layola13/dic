词源: From consume + -ed + -ly.  The adverbial ending '-ly' transforms the adjective 'consumed' (meaning overwhelmed or engrossed) into an adverb. 'Consumed' itself comes from the verb 'consume,' ultimately derived from the Latin 'consumere,' meaning "to take up completely, devour, destroy."  The sense of being completely engrossed by something developed from the idea of being "devoured" or "taken over" by it.
