ETYMOLOGY->
From French *galvaniser*, from Italian *galvanizzare*, from Luigi Galvani, Italian physician and physicist (1737-1798), who discovered that a frog's leg would twitch when touched by two different metals.  Initially referring to the twitching itself, the term was later applied to the process of coating metal with zinc, which was discovered to produce a similar electrical effect.
