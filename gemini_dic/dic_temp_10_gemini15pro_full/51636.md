devexity:/ˌdiːˈvɛksɪti/ | n. |凸度，凸性|The devexity of a curve is a measure of its curvature.  一条曲线的凸度是其曲率的量度。| The lens has a slight devexity. 这个透镜略微凸起。 |近义词：convexity, protuberance, bulge |反义词: concavity | 词性: 名词

词源:  From Latin *dēvexitas, from dēvexus (“sloping downward”), from dē- (“down”) + vexus, past participle of vehō (“carry, convey”).  源自拉丁语 *dēvexitas，来自 dēvexus（“向下倾斜”），来自 dē-（“向下”） + vexus，vehō（“携带，运送”）的过去分词。虽然词源指向“向下倾斜”，但在现代用法中，devexity 通常指向上凸起。
