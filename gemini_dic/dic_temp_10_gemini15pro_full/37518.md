common-grounds: (This is not a standard dictionary entry.  "Common ground" is typically written as two words.)  If seen hyphenated, it would still function as a noun and carry the same meaning and usage as "common ground."

Etymology: "Common" comes from the Old French "comun" and Latin "communis," meaning "shared by all or many." "Ground" originates from Old English "grund," meaning "bottom, foundation, earth."  The combined meaning refers to a shared basis or foundation for understanding.
