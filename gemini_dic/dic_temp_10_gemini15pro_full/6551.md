amylolytic:/ˌæmɪloʊˈlɪtɪk/
adjective
淀粉分解的;  淀粉水解的
Relating to, characterized by, or causing the hydrolysis of starch.
Amylolytic enzymes break down starch into simpler sugars. 淀粉分解酶将淀粉分解成更简单的糖。
Amylase is an amylolytic enzyme. 淀粉酶是一种淀粉分解的酶。
近义词:starch-digesting, diastatic
反义词: (No direct antonym, but consider terms related to starch synthesis)

词源:
From amyl(o)-  + -lytic.  "amyl(o)-" refers to starch, derived from Greek "amylon" (starch). "-lytic" means  "dissolving" or "loosening," derived from Greek "lytikos".
