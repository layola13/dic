词性: adverb
词源: From "deperdit," an obsolete past participle of the Latin verb "dēperdō" (to destroy, lose utterly), + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  While "deperdit" itself is obsolete, "deperditely" saw some usage, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries, before largely falling out of favor in favor of "desperately."
