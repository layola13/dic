dster:  This appears to be a typo. Did you perhaps mean "duster," "dexter," or "ster"?  I will provide analyses for each of these possibilities.


**1. Duster:**

/ˈdʌstər/ | n. |  掸子，除尘器 | A cloth or brush for removing dust. | Example:  Use a duster to clean the shelves.  用掸子清洁架子。

Example:  She bought a feather duster. 她买了一个羽毛掸子。| Synonym:  cloth, brush, wiper | Antonym:  (No direct antonym) | Noun


USAGE->

*(The following examples apply to "duster" as a noun.  Since it's not typically used as a verb, adjective, etc., those tenses are not applicable.)*

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The duster is on the shelf. = 掸子在架子上。
Dusters remove dust effectively. = 掸子能有效地清除灰尘。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
I used the duster yesterday. = 我昨天用了掸子。
She bought a new duster last week. = 她上周买了个新掸子。



PHRASE->
feather duster = 羽毛掸子



**2. Dexter:** /ˈdɛkstər/ | adj. |  灵巧的，惯用右手的 | Skillful with the hands; right-handed. | Example: He's very dexter with a needle and thread. 他用针线非常灵巧。

Example:  She's dexterous in all her movements. 她的所有动作都很灵巧。 | Synonym:  skillful, adroit, adept, right-handed | Antonym:  clumsy, awkward, left-handed | Adjective



USAGE->

*(The following examples apply to "dexter" as an adjective.)*

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
He is a dexter surgeon.  = 他是一位灵巧的外科医生。
She is dexter with both hands. = 她双手都很灵巧。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
He was dexter enough to perform the delicate operation.  = 他足够灵巧，可以进行精细的手术。
Her dexter hands quickly repaired the tear. = 她灵巧的双手迅速修补了裂缝。



**3. Ster:** This is not a standalone word in English. It's often a suffix (like -ster in youngster, gangster) indicating a person associated with something or possessing a certain quality.  It doesn't have its own pronunciation, definition, or grammatical function in isolation.  Therefore, it cannot be analyzed as a separate word.  If you intended a different word containing "ster," please provide it.


**Important Note:** Since "duster" is primarily a noun and "dexter" an adjective, most of the tenses and grammatical constructions listed in your original prompt are not relevant. I've provided examples for the simple present and simple past tenses, which are the most commonly used with these words.
