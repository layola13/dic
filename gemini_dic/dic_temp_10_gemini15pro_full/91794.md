PHRASE->
No real set phrases exist with "hyperfastidious".  It is typically used on its own to describe someone's behavior or attitude.


词源:
From hyper- + fastidious.  Hyper- is a prefix meaning "over, beyond, excessive," while fastidious comes from Latin *fastidiosus, from fastidium "loathing, disgust," from fastus "pride, arrogance" + taedium "weariness, disgust."  Thus, the word literally implies excessive disgust or disdain, leading to extreme pickiness.
