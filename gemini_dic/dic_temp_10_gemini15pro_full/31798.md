ETYMOLOGY->
From "check mark" (n.), which originated in the late 19th century. "Check" in this context refers to a mark used for verification or confirmation, ultimately deriving from the game of chess, where "check" signifies a threat to the king.  "Mark" simply means a visible sign or indication.  The verb form "checkmarked" arose naturally from the noun.
