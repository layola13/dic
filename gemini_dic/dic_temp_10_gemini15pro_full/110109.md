词源:  The origin of "lickety-split" is uncertain, but it's thought to be an Americanism from the mid-19th century.  It might be related to the phrase "lick and a promise" (a hasty, superficial cleaning), or it might evoke the speed of licking something up.  The "split" part could reinforce the idea of swiftness, like splitting the air.
