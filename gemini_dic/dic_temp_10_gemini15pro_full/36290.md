coherald: /koʊˈhɛrəld/ | n. | 预示者，先驱 | A person or thing that precedes and indicates the approach of something or someone. | The robin is a coherald of spring. 知更鸟是春天的预兆。|  近义词：harbinger, forerunner, precursor | 反义词：follower, successor | 词性：名词


词源： From co- + herald.  "Co-"  acts as a prefix meaning "together" or "jointly". "Herald" comes from Old French "heralt" and ultimately from Frankish "harja-waldaz" meaning "army commander".  Over time, the meaning shifted from a military messenger to someone who announces important news or events.  Therefore, "coherald" suggests something that announces something else alongside other signs or indicators.
