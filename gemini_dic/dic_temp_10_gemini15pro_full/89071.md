holosteric:/ˌhɒləˈstɛrɪk/ /ˌhoʊləˈstɛrɪk/
adj.
全位效应的，全位调节的
Relating to or denoting the binding of a modulator molecule to a protein at a site other than the active site, which induces a conformational change affecting the protein's activity.
Holosteric enzymes exhibit cooperativity, meaning the binding of one substrate molecule affects the binding of subsequent substrate molecules.  This is different from allosteric regulation, which involves a separate regulatory site. Holosteric regulation considers the entire protein structure.
The holosteric enzyme showed a sigmoidal kinetic curve, indicating cooperativity.  全位效应酶表现出S形动力学曲线，表明存在协同性。
Mutations in the protein can disrupt holosteric regulation, leading to disease. 蛋白质中的突变会破坏全位调节，导致疾病。
近义词: cooperative, allosteric (in some contexts)
反义词: non-cooperative
词性: adjective
