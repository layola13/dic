ETYMOLOGY->
From Spanish *banderilla*, diminutive of *bandera* ("flag, banner"), from Old Spanish *vandera*, from Gothic *bandwō*, from Proto-Germanic *bandwō* (“sign, banner”), from Proto-Indo-European *bend- (“to bind”).  The term likely derives from the small flags or streamers sometimes attached to the darts.
