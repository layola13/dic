ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *clene, from Old English clǣne (“clean, pure, clear, innocent, unsullied”), from Proto-Germanic *klainą (“clean, clear, bright”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵley- (“to shine, shimmer; clean, pure”).  Cognate with German klein (“small, little”), Dutch klein (“small, little”),  Latin glans (“acorn”). The semantic development from “shining” to “clean” is paralleled by Latin clarus (“clear, bright”) and English clear.
