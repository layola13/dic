PHRASE->
There is no commonly used phrase with "half-justified" as it is a technical term.


词源:  "Half" comes from Old English "healf." "Justified" comes from Old French "justifier," ultimately from Latin "iustificare" meaning "to make just."  "Half-justified" combines these two words to describe something that is only partially justified or aligned.
