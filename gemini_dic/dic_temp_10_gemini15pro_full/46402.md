词源:  From "daffy," a colloquial alteration of "daft," meaning "mildly insane or foolish."  "Daft" likely comes from Middle English *daft*, from Old Norse *daufr* meaning "deaf, stupid."  The connection likely arose from the idea that a deaf person, unable to hear and participate in conversation, might appear unintelligent.  The "-iest" suffix is a superlative ending.
