From Late Latin *Orcadia (via French Orcades) referring to the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, where the length of the summer day varies significantly between solstices + -ian (suffix forming adjectives).  The term was coined by Scottish scientist W.W. Garner and H.A. Allard in 1960 to describe biological cycles with a period of about 24 hours, not necessarily linked to the day-night cycle.
