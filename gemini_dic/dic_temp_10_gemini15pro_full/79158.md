ETYMOLOGY->
"Glama" is a shortened, informal version of "glamour."  "Glamour" itself originates from the Scottish word "gramarye," meaning magic, enchantment, or spell. This evolved into "grammar" in English, which originally referred to learning, especially of the occult kind. Over time, "grammar" became associated with the more general study of language.  The association with magic and enchantment persisted, and eventually led to the development of "glamour" in the 19th century, meaning a magical or alluring charm.
