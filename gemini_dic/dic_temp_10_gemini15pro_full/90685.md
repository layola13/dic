词源:

The word "humbug" originated in the late 18th century, possibly as student slang at Trinity College, Dublin. Its etymology is uncertain, but it may be a blend of "hum" (expressing deception) and "bug" (meaning "goblin" or "bogeyman").  "Humbugger" is a later formation, likely derived directly from "humbug" with the addition of the agentive suffix "-er."
