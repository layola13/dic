Etymology: From glamour + -ize. Glamour comes from the Scots word gramarye, meaning magic, enchantment, or spell, which itself ultimately derives from grammar.  This association arose because literacy was rare in the past, and those who could read and write, especially Latin, were often seen as having magical powers.
