词源：
From Old English *cyninglīc (attested only as cyninglice "royally"), from cyning "king" + -līc "-ly."  The word "king" itself comes from Proto-Germanic *kuningaz, meaning "king, ruler," ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵen-, meaning "to give birth, beget."  This suggests the original sense of "king" was related to kinship and lineage.
