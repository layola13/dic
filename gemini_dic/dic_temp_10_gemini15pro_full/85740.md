Etymology: From Middle English *hauken, from Old English *hafoc, meaning "hawk."  The verb sense of "to hawk" (sell goods) likely arose from the image of a hawk swooping down on prey, similar to how a street vendor might aggressively seek customers. The verb sense of "to hawk" (clear the throat) is imitative of the sound produced.
