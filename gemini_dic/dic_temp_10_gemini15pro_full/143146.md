注意事项:

"Outcept" is considered archaic or dialectal.  While grammatically correct in some dialects, using "except" is generally recommended in formal and standard English.  The provided examples demonstrate usage, but using "except" in their place would be preferable in most situations.  The future continuous and future perfect continuous examples are particularly strained as "outcept" is rarely used in those tenses.
