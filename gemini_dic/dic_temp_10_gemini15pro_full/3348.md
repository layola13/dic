ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *affraier "to frighten, startle, terrify," from Vulgar Latin *exfridare, from Latin ex- "out" + *fridus, from Gothic faurhtjan "to frighten."  The original sense was "to break the peace by fighting," hence "frighten, terrify."  The meaning shifted to "a fight, brawl" in the 15th century.
