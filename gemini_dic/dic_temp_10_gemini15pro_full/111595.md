Etymology:
lobster + pound.  "Lobster" comes from Old English "loppestre," likely influenced by Old Norse "humarr." "Pound" in this sense refers to an enclosure, from Old English "pund," ultimately from Latin "pondus" (weight), as pounds were originally enclosures for stray animals until their owners could claim them.
