词源: From Greek *ἀνδρ- (andr-) + *ἀνατομία (anatomía), meaning "dissection."  *ἀνδρ- (andr-) refers to "man," while *ἀνατομία (anatomía) comes from *ἀνά (aná, "up") + *τέμνειν (témnein, "to cut").  While the Greek root *ἀνδρ- suggests "man," in modern scientific usage, "andranatomy" would typically refer to the anatomy of the male human body, distinguishing it from female anatomy or more general human anatomy.  Often, simply "anatomy" is used to refer to human anatomy unless otherwise specified.
