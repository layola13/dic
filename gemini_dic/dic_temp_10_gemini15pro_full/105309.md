kibibyte:/ˈkɪbibaɪt/| n. |千字节（二进制）|A unit of information equal to 1,024 bytes (2^10 bytes).  It is used to avoid the ambiguity associated with the use of kilobyte, which in some contexts means 1,000 bytes. |Example: This file is 10 kibibytes in size.  这个文件大小为 10 千字节（二进制）。

Example: My flash drive has a capacity of several mebibytes, much larger than older drives measured in kilobytes. 我的闪存盘容量有几兆字节（二进制），比以前以千字节为单位的旧驱动器大得多。|近义词：kilobyte (in some contexts), mebibyte (1024 kibibytes)|反义词: N/A|词性:noun
