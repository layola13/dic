词源:
From Middle English *kipper*, from *kippen* (“to spawn (of salmon, herring, etc.)”), probably of Scandinavian origin; compare Norwegian *kippa* (“small salmon, parr”) (whence also Dutch *kippen* (“to hatch”)), Icelandic *kippa* (“young salmon, grilse”).  The original sense was a salmon that had recently spawned, and was therefore in poor condition.  The term was later applied to herrings, and eventually to preserved herrings.
