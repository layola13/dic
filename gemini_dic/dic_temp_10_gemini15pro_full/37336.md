USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Il commence le travail chaque matin. = He starts work every morning.
Elle commence ses études en septembre. = She begins her studies in September.

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Il est en train de commencer un nouveau projet. = He is starting a new project.  (This tense is less natural with "commencer" in French and even less so in its Anglicized English form)
Elle est en train de commencer à apprendre l'espagnol. = She is starting to learn Spanish. (Again, less natural with "commencer")

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Il a commencé la réunion. = He has started the meeting.
Elle a commencé à écrire un livre. = She has begun writing a book.

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
This tense is not typically used with "commencer" in French or its Anglicized English form, as it implies duration of the starting action itself, which is generally instantaneous.

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Il commença son discours par une blague. = He began his speech with a joke.
Elle commença à pleuvoir. = It began to rain.

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Quand je suis arrivé, il était en train de commencer son repas. = When I arrived, he was beginning his meal. (Less common with "commencer")

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Il avait commencé à travailler avant mon arrivée. = He had started working before my arrival.
Elle avait commencé à lire le livre avant de s'endormir. = She had begun reading the book before falling asleep.

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
This tense is also not typically used with "commencer" for the same reasons as the present perfect continuous.

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Il commencera les travaux demain. = He will begin the work tomorrow.
Elle commencera son nouveau travail la semaine prochaine. = She will start her new job next week.

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
This tense is not typically used with "commencer".

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
Il aura commencé le projet avant la fin du mois. = He will have started the project before the end of the month.
Elle aura commencé ses études avant Noël. = She will have begun her studies before Christmas.

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
This tense is also not typically used with "commencer".


虚拟语气:
S'il commençait à travailler plus tôt, il finirait plus tôt. = If he started working earlier, he would finish earlier.
J'aimerais qu'elle commence à apprendre le français. = I wish she would start learning French.

被动语态:
Les travaux seront commencés la semaine prochaine. = The work will be started next week. (Less common in both French and English)

PHRASE->
(Phrases are less common with the Anglicized "commencer" as it is not a frequently used word.  These examples therefore utilize the French "commencer".)

commencer à + infinitive = to begin to
commencer par + infinitive = to begin by
commencer de + infinitive = to begin to (more literary)
commencer quelque chose = to begin something
commencer à faire quelque chose = to start doing something


词源:
From Old French comencer, from Late Latin *cuminitiare, from Latin initiare ("to begin").


注意事项:
While "commencer" can be used in English, it is much less common than "begin" or "start" and can sound somewhat formal or archaic.  In French, however, it is a common and standard verb.
