词源: From Late Latin *apophlegmaticus, from Greek *ἀποφλεγματικός (apophlegmatikos), from ἀπό (apo, "away from") + φλέγμα (phlegma, "phlegm, inflammation") + -ικός (-ikos, adjectival suffix).  The original meaning related to the ancient Greek theory of the four humors, where phlegm was associated with a calm temperament.
