词源:  From leather + -ed, the past participle suffix, meaning “covered with leather” or “having the appearance or texture of leather.”  The slang meaning "drunk" is of uncertain origin but likely arose in the 20th century, possibly as an extension of the idea of being "worn out" or "beaten up" like old leather.
