词源：From the Old English *herebeorg, meaning "army shelter," from *here "army" and *beorg "protection, shelter." Related to the Dutch herberg "inn" and German Herberge "shelter, hostel." Originally referring to a place of shelter or refuge, especially for ships, the word later broadened to encompass the idea of sheltering or protecting anything, including thoughts and feelings.
