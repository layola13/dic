ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *abander, from a- "from, away from" + bander "to proclaim, put under a ban," from Germanic *ban "proclamation."  The sense shift occurred in French. Originally, to abandon something was to put it under a ban, hence outside the protection of the law, and thus effectively relinquished.
