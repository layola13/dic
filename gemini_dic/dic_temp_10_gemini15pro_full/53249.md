directrix:/daɪˈrektrɪks/ /dəˈrektrɪks/
n.
准线
A fixed line used in describing a curve or surface, especially a conic section. The distance from any point on the conic section to the directrix bears a constant ratio to the distance from the same point to the focus.
The parabola is defined as the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point (the focus) and a fixed line (the directrix).  抛物线被定义为与一个定点（焦点）和一条定线距离相等的所有点的集合。
The directrix of the ellipse is outside the ellipse itself. 椭圆的准线在椭圆本身的外面。
近义词: none (for this specific mathematical term)
反义词: none (for this specific mathematical term)
词性: noun

Etymology:
From Late Latin *directrix, from Latin directus (“straight, direct”), past participle of dirigō (“I arrange, direct”).  来自晚期拉丁语 *directrix，源自拉丁语 directus（“直的，直接的”），dirigō（“我安排，指导”）的过去分词。
