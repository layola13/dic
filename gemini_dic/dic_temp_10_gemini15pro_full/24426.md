The word "brisos" does not exist in standard English, Spanish, French, or other common languages.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term in a very specific field, a regionalism, or slang.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For instance, is it from a song, a book, a website, or a conversation? Knowing the source could help identify its meaning and origin.
