ETYMOLOGY->
From in- + fold + -ment.  "In-" signifies "inward" or "into." "Fold" refers to the act of bending something over on itself. "-ment" is a suffix forming nouns from verbs, indicating the result or product of an action. Thus, "infoldment" literally means the act or result of folding something inward.
