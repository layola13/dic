词源:  From declassify + -ation.  "Declassify" comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "remove" or "reverse") and "classify" (meaning "to arrange or organize according to class or category").  The suffix "-ation" forms nouns of action or process.  Therefore, "declassification" literally refers to the process of removing something from a classified (secret) status.
