ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *acervātus*, past participle of acervāre (“to heap up”), from acervus (“heap”).

USAGE->
一般现在时:
An acervate forms when certain organic molecules are mixed together. = 当某些有机分子混合在一起时，就会形成凝聚体。
The acervate grows by absorbing more molecules from its surroundings. = 凝聚体通过从周围环境吸收更多分子而生长。


一般过去时:
Oparin demonstrated how acervates could form spontaneously. = 奥帕林演示了凝聚体是如何自发形成的。
The experiment showed that acervates could maintain a stable internal environment. = 实验表明，凝聚体可以维持稳定的内部环境。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied acervates for many years. = 研究人员已经研究凝聚体很多年了。
Scientists have proposed various theories about the role of acervates in the origin of life. = 科学家们提出了关于凝聚体在生命起源中作用的各种理论。


过去完成时:
Before Oparin's work, scientists had not considered acervates as a possible precursor to cells. = 在奥帕林的工作之前，科学家们还没有考虑过凝聚体作为细胞的可能前体。
Researchers had already observed similar structures before they were named acervates. = 研究人员在它们被命名为凝聚体之前就已经观察到了类似的结构。


将来时:
Further research will likely reveal more about the properties of acervates. = 进一步的研究可能会揭示更多关于凝聚体特性的信息。
Scientists will continue to investigate the potential role of acervates in the development of life. = 科学家将继续研究凝聚体在生命发展中的潜在作用。



被动语态:
