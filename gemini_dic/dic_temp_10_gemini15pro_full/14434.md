auxetic:/ɔːkˈsɛtɪk/
adjective|拉胀的，负泊松比的|Having a negative Poisson's ratio, which means that the material becomes thicker perpendicular to the applied force when stretched. |Example: Auxetic materials expand when stretched, unlike conventional materials. 拉胀材料在被拉伸时会膨胀，这与传统材料不同。|Example:  Researchers are exploring the potential of auxetic foams in protective gear. 研究人员正在探索拉胀泡沫在防护装备中的潜力。|Synonyms:  non-auxetic (antonym, in a sense), expanding (loosely) |Antonyms:  conventional (in terms of material behavior)|adj.
