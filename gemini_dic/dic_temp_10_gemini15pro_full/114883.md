词源： "Mammy" is a derogatory term for a Black woman who worked as a nanny or housekeeper, particularly in the southern United States.  "Wagon" refers to a four-wheeled vehicle. The term "mammy-wagon" thus arose as a colloquialism for a large baby carriage, often pushed by a nanny.  The term is now considered offensive due to its racist connotations.
