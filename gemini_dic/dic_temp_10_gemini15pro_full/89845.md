hornotine: /hɔːrˈnɒtaɪn/ | n. | 春季激素; 春季素 | A hypothetical plant hormone, thought to stimulate growth in spring. |  No verifiable examples found in current usage. The concept of "hornotine" seems to be outdated or speculative.  | Near synonyms:  plant growth regulator, phytohormone | Antonyms: growth inhibitor | Noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Hornotine, if it exists, stimulates plant growth. = 如果春化素存在的话，它会刺激植物生长。
Does hornotine affect flowering time? = 春化素会影响开花时间吗？

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Scientists are still researching the effects of hypothetical hornotines. = 科学家们仍在研究假想的春化素的影响。
Are plants responding to hornotine in this experiment? = 在这个实验中，植物对春化素有反应吗？

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Researchers have not yet proven the existence of hornotine. = 研究人员尚未证实春化素的存在。
Has anyone isolated hornotine from plant tissues? = 有人从植物组织中分离出春化素吗？

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Botanists have been studying plant growth regulators for decades, including theoretical hornotines. = 植物学家几十年来一直在研究植物生长调节剂，包括理论上的春化素。
Have they been searching for evidence of hornotine in spring growth? = 他们一直在寻找春化素在春季生长中的证据吗？

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Early botanists theorized about the existence of a spring growth hormone, which they called hornotine. = 早期的植物学家推测存在一种春季生长激素，他们称之为春化素。
Did the researchers find any evidence of hornotine in their experiments? = 研究人员在他们的实验中发现了春化素的证据吗？

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Scientists were investigating the role of hornotine in bud break when they discovered other growth factors. = 科学家们在研究春化素在芽萌发中的作用时，发现了其他生长因子。
Were they studying hornotine's influence on flowering? = 他们当时在研究春化素对开花的影响吗？

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before the discovery of other plant hormones, scientists had postulated the existence of hornotine. = 在发现其他植物激素之前，科学家们曾假设春化素的存在。
Had researchers already abandoned the concept of hornotine before modern genetic analysis? = 在现代基因分析之前，研究人员就已经放弃了春化素的概念吗？

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Researchers had been searching for hornotine for years before realizing its hypothetical nature. = 研究人员多年来一直在寻找春化素，才意识到它的假设性质。
Had they been experimenting with hornotine extracts before other plant hormones were identified? = 在其他植物激素被鉴定出来之前，他们一直在用春化素提取物进行实验吗？

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Future research will likely focus on specific plant hormones rather than hypothetical ones like hornotine. = 未来的研究可能会集中在特定的植物激素上，而不是像春化素这样的假设激素。
Will scientists ever prove the existence of hornotine? = 科学家们会证明春化素的存在吗？


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Scientists will be exploring the complex interplay of known plant hormones in the coming years. = 在未来几年里，科学家们将探索已知植物激素之间复杂的相互作用。
Will researchers be investigating the potential role of other, as-yet-undiscovered, growth regulators? = 研究人员会研究其他尚未发现的生长调节剂的潜在作用吗？

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the century, scientists will have identified many more plant growth regulators. = 到本世纪末，科学家们将已经鉴定出更多的植物生长调节剂。
Will they have definitively proven or disproven the existence of hornotine by then? = 到那时，他们会最终证明或反驳春化素的存在吗？

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By 2050, botanists will have been studying plant hormones for over a century. = 到2050年，植物学家研究植物激素将超过一个世纪。
Will they have been researching the mechanisms of plant growth regulation in more detail? = 他们会更详细地研究植物生长调节机制吗？



PHRASE->  (Given the lack of real-world usage of "hornotine", phrases are difficult to construct meaningfully.  These are hypothetical examples assuming the word was in common usage.)

The effect of hornotine on plant growth. = 春化素对植物生长的影响。
Hornotine levels in spring. = 春季的春化素水平。
Stimulating growth with hornotine. = 用春化素刺激生长。
The role of hornotine in flowering. = 春化素在开花中的作用。
Comparing hornotine with auxin. = 比较春化素和生长素。
