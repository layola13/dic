ETYMOLOGY->
From accursed + -ly. Accursed from Old English ācursod, past participle of ācursian ‘to curse’, from ā- ‘thoroughly’ + cursian ‘to curse’.

USAGE->
This word is primarily used for emphasis.  It doesn't fit neatly into standard grammatical categories like tenses, as it modifies other words rather than acting as the main verb or subject.

Example with an adjective:
The weather is accursedly cold today. = 今天天气冷得要命。
This accursedly complicated machine keeps breaking down. = 这该死的复杂机器总是坏。


Example with an adverb:
He drives accursedly slowly. = 他开车开得慢得要死。
She sings accursedly loudly. = 她唱歌的声音大得吓人。



PHRASE->
While "accursedly" can be used with many words, it doesn't form set phrases in the same way as some other words.  It's generally used directly before the word it modifies.

Example:
accursedly hot = 热得要命
accursedly difficult = 难的要死
accursedly slow = 慢得要死
accursedly expensive = 贵得离谱
accursedly complicated = 复杂得要命
