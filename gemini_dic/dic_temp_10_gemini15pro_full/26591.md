PHRASE->
(Due to the vulgar nature of the word, common phrases are unlikely and would generally be considered inappropriate.)  Given this, here are some hypothetical examples using more common synonyms for illustrative purposes:

What's up with all the dog poop? = 这么多狗屎是怎么回事？
What the hell!  The dog pooped on the rug again! = 搞什么鬼！狗又在地毯上拉屎了！
What if the cat poops outside the litter box? = 如果猫在猫砂盆外面拉屎怎么办？

No matter what, clean up the dog poop. = 无论如何，都要清理狗屎。

注意事项:

Because "cacadas" is a childish and informal term, its usage should be restricted to very informal contexts, and even then, it might be perceived as inappropriate.  Using standard terms like "feces," "poop," or "droppings" is generally preferred.
