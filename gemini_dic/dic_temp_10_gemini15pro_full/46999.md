ETYMOLOGY->
From "dash" (meaning to move quickly) + "off" (indicating completion or separation).  The combined meaning suggests an action done quickly and then finished or sent away.  "Dash" itself originates from Scandinavian sources, likely related to the Danish word "daske" meaning to strike or slap.  This sense of quick, forceful movement evolved into the meaning of rapid motion.
