ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *flegge*, from Old Norse *fleygja* (to fly), from Proto-Germanic *flugijaną* (to fly), from Proto-Indo-European *plewk- (to fly, flow).  The noun sense developed from the verb *fledge*, meaning "to acquire feathers necessary for flight," which in turn came from the idea of a bird leaving the nest.
