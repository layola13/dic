词源: non- (not) + inclusiveness + -es (plural marker).  "Inclusiveness" comes from "include" (from Latin "includere"), meaning to enclose or contain.  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state or quality.  The plural "-es" is added because the word refers to multiple instances or types of non-inclusion.
