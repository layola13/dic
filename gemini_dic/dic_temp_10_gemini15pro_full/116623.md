词源:
From matronly + -ness + -es.  Matron comes from Old French matrone, from Latin matrona "married woman, wife, mother," ultimately from mater "mother."  The suffix -ly forms adjectives, -ness forms nouns denoting a state or quality, and -es marks the plural.

用法说明:
This word is rarely used in modern English.  It's more common to see "matronliness" in the singular.  The plural form "matronlinesses" would generally only be used when discussing multiple distinct instances or types of matronly behavior or qualities.
