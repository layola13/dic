Etymology:
From masterly + -ness + -es (plural suffix).  "Masterly" comes from "master" (from Old French "maistre," ultimately from Latin "magister") meaning "one having control or authority,"  combined with the suffix "-ly" which transforms nouns into adjectives.  "-ness" transforms adjectives into nouns denoting a state or quality. "-es" creates the plural form.
