bacteroid:/ˈbæktərɔɪd/| n. |类菌体；拟细菌体|A bacteroid is a swollen, misshapen, branched, or club-shaped form of certain bacteria. It is especially characteristic of the genus *Rhizobium* in the root nodules of legumes.|The bacteroids in the root nodules fix nitrogen from the air.  根瘤中的类菌体从空气中固定氮。|Nitrogen-fixing bacteria transform into bacteroids within the legume root nodule.  固氮细菌在豆科植物根瘤内转化为类菌体。|Synonyms: rhizobia (specifically for nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legumes)|Antonyms: None|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From *bacter* (rod, bacterium) + *-oid* (resembling).  Ultimately from Greek *baktērion* (small staff, rod) + *-oeidēs* (having the form of).
