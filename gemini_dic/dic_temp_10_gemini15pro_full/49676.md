词源:
From de- + mist + -ed.  "De-" is a prefix meaning "remove" or "reverse". "Mist" refers to a cloud of tiny water droplets suspended in the atmosphere at or near the earth's surface limiting visibility. "-ed" is a suffix used to form the past participle of regular verbs, and also adjectives.  Therefore, "demisted" literally means having had the mist removed.
