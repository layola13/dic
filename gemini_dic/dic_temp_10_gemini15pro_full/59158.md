dyne:/daɪn/| n.|达因|A unit of force in the centimeter-gram-second system of physical units, equal to the force that imparts an acceleration of one centimeter per second per second to a mass of one gram.|A dyne is a very small unit of force; the force of gravity on a small coin is roughly equal to 1000 dynes.|近义词:force unit|反义词:(No direct antonym for a unit of measurement)|词性:noun

Etymology:
From French *dyne*, from Ancient Greek δύναμις (dúnamis, “power, force”).
