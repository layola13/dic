ETYMOLOGY->
From French *minargent*, from *min-* (from Latin *mina*, meaning "mine, ore") + *argent* (meaning "silver," from Latin *argentum*).  While "minargent" appears in some older texts, it is now considered archaic or obsolete and rarely used.  "Argent" is the more common term for silvery or silver-colored.
