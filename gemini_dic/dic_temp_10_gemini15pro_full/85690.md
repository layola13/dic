注意事项:  As "haven't" is a contraction of "have not," its usage follows the rules of the verb "to have" in its various tenses.  It is most commonly used in present perfect and present perfect continuous tenses. It's important to note that for past tenses, the contraction becomes "hadn't" (had not).  "Haven't" is not used in future tenses directly, nor is it used in the passive voice.
