karyokinesis:/ˌkærioʊkɪˈniːsɪs/ /ˌkæriəʊkɪˈniːsɪs/
noun
核分裂
The process of nuclear division, involving the division of the chromosomes and their movement to opposite poles of the cell, but not including cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm).
Karyokinesis is the first step in mitosis, followed by cytokinesis. 核分裂是有丝分裂的第一步，随后是胞质分裂。
The process of karyokinesis ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes. 核分裂过程确保每个子细胞都获得一套完整的染色体。
