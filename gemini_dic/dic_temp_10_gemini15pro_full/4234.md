airlock: /ˈɛərlɒk/ (UK) /ˈɛrlɑːk/ (US) | n. | 气闸 | An airtight chamber with two doors that allows passage between two spaces with different pressures, such as a spacecraft and outer space, or a pressurized underwater structure and the surrounding water. | Example: The astronauts cycled through the airlock before stepping onto the lunar surface. 宇航员在踏上月球表面之前先通过了气闸。

Example: The submarine's airlock allowed divers to enter and exit the vessel underwater. 潜水艇的气闸允许潜水员在水下进出船只。 | Synonym: pressure chamber, decompression chamber | Antonym: open door, open passage | noun

airlocks: /ˈɛərlɒks/ (UK) /ˈɛrlɑːks/ (US) | n. | 气闸（复数）| Airtight chambers with two doors, allowing passage between areas with different pressures.  | Example: The space station's airlocks were crucial for safe extravehicular activities. 空间站的气闸对于安全的舱外活动至关重要。


Example:  The deep-sea habitat had multiple airlocks for redundancy. 深海栖息地有多个气闸以保证安全冗余。| Synonym: pressure chambers, decompression chambers | Antonym: open doors, open passages | noun
