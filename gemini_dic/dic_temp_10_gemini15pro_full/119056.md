metive: /ˈmiːtɪv/ | adj. | 激励的，积极的 | Motivating; having the power to incite action.  This word is not commonly used and may be considered archaic or even non-standard. It’s likely a misspelling or a rare variant of "motive" used as an adjective.  |  His metive speech inspired the team.  他的激励人心的演讲鼓舞了整个团队。(This example uses "metive" in the way someone might intend it, even if it's not standard English.) | 近义词: motivating, inspiring, stimulating, encouraging | 反义词: demotivating, discouraging, disheartening | 词性: Adjective (used informally, potentially a misspelling)


词源: Likely derived from the noun "motive" (from Old French motif, ultimately from Latin motus, past participle of movēre "to move"), with the "-ive" suffix added to create an adjective form, similar to how other adjectives are formed (e.g., "active" from "act"). However, this formation is not standard.
