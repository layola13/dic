Etymology:  foot + sore + -ness

foot (n.) Old English *fot, from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Saxon fot, Old Frisian fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot."

sore (adj.) Old English sar "painful, grievous, severe; sad, sorrowful," from Proto-Germanic *saira- (source also of Old Saxon ser, Old Norse sar, Old Frisian ser, Dutch zeer, Old High German ser, German sehr "very," Gothic sair "sore, painful"), perhaps from PIE root *sai- "to hurt, injure." The sense evolution is perhaps from "wounded" to "painful" to "causing pain."

-ness (suffix) forming nouns from adjectives, Old English -nes(s), -nis(s), -nyss, from Proto-Germanic *-inassu-, *-anassu- (cognates: Old Saxon and Old High German -nissi, Old Norse -neskja), from PIE *-nessos, adjectival suffix of compound formation.
