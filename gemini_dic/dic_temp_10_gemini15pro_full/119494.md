micropegmatite:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌpɛɡməˌtaɪt/| n.|微伟晶岩|A very fine-grained igneous rock having the composition of pegmatite.  It typically occurs as a dike rock or in small irregular bodies.|The geologist identified the sample as a micropegmatite due to its fine texture and composition.|近义词:granophyre (though not always synonymous, they are often used interchangeably), graphic granite|反义词: (No direct antonym.  One could consider coarsely crystalline rocks like regular pegmatite as a contrasting term, though not a true opposite)|noun
