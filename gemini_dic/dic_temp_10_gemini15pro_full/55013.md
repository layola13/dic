ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *desputer* (Modern French *disputer*), from Latin *disputare* "to discuss, examine, argue, discourse," from *dis-* "apart, in different directions" + *putare* "to reckon, think, believe, suppose."  The original meaning was "to discuss" or "to argue," and the sense of "to quarrel" developed later.
