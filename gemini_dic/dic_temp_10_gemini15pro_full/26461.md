将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the program will have processed all the bytes of data. = 到明天，程序将已经处理了所有字节数据。
The computer will have written the bytes to the disk by the end of the day. = 到今天结束时，计算机将已经把字节写入磁盘。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):

The network will have been transferring bytes of information for days by the time it finishes. = 到完成时，网络将已经传输了数天的字节信息。

虚拟语气:
If the program could process more bytes, it would be faster. = 如果程序可以处理更多字节，它会更快。
I wish the file had fewer bytes. = 我希望文件字节更少。


被动语态:
Millions of bytes are processed by the computer every second. = 计算机每秒处理数百万字节。
The bytes of data were transferred over the network. = 字节数据通过网络传输。

疑问句:
How many bytes are in a kilobyte? = 一千字节有多少字节？
Where are these bytes stored? = 这些字节存储在哪里？

否定句:
The file doesn't contain many bytes. = 该文件不包含很多字节。
The program didn't read all the bytes. = 程序没有读取所有字节。


PHRASE->
data in bytes = 以字节为单位的数据
transfer bytes = 传输字节
store bytes = 存储字节
process bytes = 处理字节
read bytes = 读取字节
