Etymology:
From "over" + "copious" + "-ness" + "-es" (plural). "Over" is an Old English prefix meaning "above," "excessive," or "too much." "Copious" comes from the Latin word "copiosus," meaning "plentiful" or "abundant." "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns indicating a state or quality. "-es" is the plural suffix.
