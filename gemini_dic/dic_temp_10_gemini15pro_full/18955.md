bestain:/bɪˈsteɪn/
verb|玷污，污染; 弄脏，沾污|To stain or soil something, often with blood or some other discoloring substance.|The murderer's hands were bestained with blood.|近义词:stain, soil, tarnish, sully|反义词:clean, cleanse, purify|词性:v.
Etymology: From be- + stain.  "Be-" is a prefix of Germanic origin meaning "all around," "thoroughly," or "cause to be." "Stain" comes from Old French "esteindre," meaning "to extinguish" or "to put out (a fire/light)," which later evolved to mean "discolor." The combination thus implies a thorough discoloration or staining.
