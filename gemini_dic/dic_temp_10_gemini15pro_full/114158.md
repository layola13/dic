PHRASE->

(Since "mahl" is not a commonly used English word, it's difficult to provide common phrases.  Instead, I will provide phrases using the more common synonym "grind.")

grind down =  磨碎，精细研磨
grind up = 磨碎，碾碎
grind to a halt =  慢慢停止
grind away =  坚持不懈地做
grind one's teeth =  咬牙切齿


注意事项:

The word "mahl" is archaic and rarely used in modern English. "Grind" is the more common and preferred term.  While "mahl" can be a noun or a verb, its use as a verb is even more outdated.
