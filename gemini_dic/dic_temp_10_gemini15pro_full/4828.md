aliasing:/ˈeɪliəsɪŋ/ | n. | 混叠，别名 | In signal processing, aliasing refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.  It occurs when the sampling rate is too low to capture all the necessary information. |  The image showed clear signs of aliasing, with jagged edges on diagonal lines.  图像在斜线上显示出明显的锯齿状边缘，这是混叠的迹象。| synonyms: distortion, artifact,  misidentification | antonyms:  accurate representation, faithful reproduction | noun
