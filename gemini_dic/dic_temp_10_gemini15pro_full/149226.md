oxyopia:/ɒksiˈəʊpiə/ | n. | 氧视觉 | Increased visual acuity in an oxygen-rich environment.  This is typically experienced by deep-sea divers breathing oxygen-helium mixtures. | Example: The diver experienced oxyopia at depth, noticing details he hadn't seen before. 潜水员在深处经历了氧视觉，注意到以前从未见过的细节。 Example:  Oxyopia can be a temporary effect of breathing high concentrations of oxygen. 氧视觉可能是呼吸高浓度氧气的暂时效应。| 近义词: None (This is a very specific term) | 反义词: None | Noun
