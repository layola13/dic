PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in set phrases. It's usually used in more descriptive contexts.) However, we can create some examples based on usage:

1. enfested with: The barn was enfested with rats.
2. become enfested: The wound became enfested with bacteria.
3. heavily enfested: The apartment was heavily enfested with cockroaches.
4. enfested by: The crops were enfested by locusts.
5. enfesting the area:  The army was enfesting the area, looking for the rebels.

注意事项:

While "enfest" can sometimes be used metaphorically, as in "doubts enfested her mind," its primary meaning relates to literal infestation with pests or something similarly unwanted.
