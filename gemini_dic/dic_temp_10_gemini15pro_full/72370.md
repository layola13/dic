floxed:/flɑːkst/| adj.|被loxP位点侧翼的，基因被修饰的|Having loxP sites flanking a DNA sequence, allowing for the sequence to be manipulated, typically deleted or inverted, by Cre recombinase.|The floxed allele allowed for tissue-specific deletion of the gene.|近义词:genetically modified, engineered|反义词:wild-type|词性:形容词

词源: "Floxed" is derived from "flanked by loxP."  LoxP (locus of X-over P1) refers to a specific DNA sequence that is recognized by the Cre recombinase enzyme.
