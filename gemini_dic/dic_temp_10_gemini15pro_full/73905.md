词源: "Forslow" is a combination of the prefix "for-" (meaning "away," "against," or intensifying) and the verb "slow."  The prefix "for-" in this context carries the sense of "completely" or "utterly." Thus, "forslow" originally meant to make completely slow or to bring to a standstill. This usage dates back to Old English.
