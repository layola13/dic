词源: "Injoint" is likely a back-formation from "injointed," which itself is derived from the past participle of the verb "injoin," meaning "to join together" or "to command." The prefix "in-" intensifies the meaning of "join."  The word is not commonly used in modern English and may be considered archaic or obsolete.
