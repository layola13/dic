ETYMOLOGY->
From *imperialist* + *-ically*. *Imperialist* derives from *imperial* + *-ist*. *Imperial* comes from the Latin word *imperialis*, meaning "of the empire or emperor," ultimately from *imperium*, "command, power." The suffix *-ist* denotes a person who adheres to a particular doctrine or system.  The suffix *-ically* transforms the adjective *imperialist* into an adverb.
