词源：From Old English *droht (unattested) or *draht (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *draugiz, from Proto-Indo-European *dʰrowgʰ- (“to draw, pull, drag”). Cognate with Dutch drocht (“passage, ford”), German Drocht (“ravine”), Old Norse dráttr (“a drawing, pull”).  The meaning "current of air" is from the notion of being "drawn" through a space.
