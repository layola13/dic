dipyre:/ˈdaɪpaɪər/| n.|透辉石|A mineral of the pyroxene group, consisting of a silicate of calcium and magnesium.  A rock-forming mineral occurring in metamorphic rocks.|Dipyre is a common mineral in some metamorphic rocks.|近义词：pyroxene, diopside|反义词: N/A|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *dipyre*, from Ancient Greek *δίς* (dís, “twice”) + *πῦρ* (pûr, “fire”), because it fuses more readily at the edges than in the middle.
