PHRASE->

While technically not a set phrase, "the greyness's of something" is the most common usage.
It's unusual to see "greyness's" used outside of the phrase "the greyness's of..." because it's a double possessive, often considered redundant or stylistically awkward. It's generally preferable to simply use "the greyness of."  While grammatically correct in certain contexts, its use is often strained.  It's better to rephrase for clarity and naturalness.
