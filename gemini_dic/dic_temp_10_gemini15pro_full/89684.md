PHRASE->
(Interjections don't typically form set phrases.  They can be used in combination with other words, but these aren't fixed phrases like "what if.")


注意事项:
The word is primarily Australian slang.  While understood elsewhere, it might sound out of place outside of Australia.  Its origin is thought to be a variant of "Hooray," which over time morphed into a farewell.
