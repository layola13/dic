muellerian:/mɪˈlɛriən/ | adj. | 米勒管的，缪勒氏的 | Relating to Johannes Peter Müller, a German physiologist and anatomist, or to the structures or functions he described, especially the Müllerian duct. | The Muellerian ducts develop into the female reproductive tract. 米勒管会发育成女性生殖道。 |  synonyms:  paramesonephric | antonyms: Wolffian | adjective

muellerian:/mɪˈlɛriən/ | n. | 米勒管，缪勒氏管 | The Müllerian duct, also known as the paramesonephric duct, is a paired duct of the embryo that runs down the lateral side of the urogenital ridge and gives rise to the female reproductive tract. |  In females, the Muellerian ducts differentiate into the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper two-thirds of the vagina. 在雌性中，米勒管分化成输卵管、子宫、子宫颈和阴道上三分之二的部分。 | synonyms: paramesonephric duct | antonyms: Wolffian duct | noun
