ETYMOLOGY->

From Old English *fēle (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *fēlaz (“faithful, loyal, devoted”). Cognate with Old Saxon gi-fēlagi (“companion”), Old Frisian fēlaga (“companion”), Dutch veel (“much, many”), German viel (“much, many”), Old Norse félagi (“partner, mate”), Gothic 𐍆𐌹𐌻𐌿 (filu, “much, many”).  The meaning shifted from "companion" to "loyal companion" and then to simply "loyal".  The adjectival use likely developed from the noun.
