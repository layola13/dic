heteromorphism:/ˌhɛtərəˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. |异态，异形 |  The existence of two or more morphologically distinct forms in the life cycle of an organism, such as the alternation of generations in plants or the larval and adult stages of insects.  | Example 1: The butterfly exhibits a striking heteromorphism between its caterpillar and adult stages. 蝴蝶的毛毛虫和成虫阶段表现出惊人的异形性。

Example 2:  Heteromorphism is common in fungi, where different stages of the life cycle can have drastically different appearances.  异形现象在真菌中很常见，其生命周期的不同阶段可以有截然不同的外观。 | 近义词: polymorphism, allomorphism | 反义词: isomorphism, monomorphism | 词性: noun

heteromorphic:/ˌhɛtərəˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. |异态的，异形的 | Occurring in two or more different forms, especially at different stages of the life cycle. | Example 1: The heteromorphic leaves of the water lily adapt to both submerged and floating conditions.  睡莲的异形叶片适应了水下和漂浮两种环境。
