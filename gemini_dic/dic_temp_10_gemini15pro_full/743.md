absis:/ˈæbsɪs/| n. |横坐标|The horizontal coordinate in a two-dimensional coordinate system, often denoted by 'x'.|The absis of the point (3, 4) is 3.  这个点(3, 4)的横坐标是3。

The graph shows the relationship between time (absis) and distance (ordinate).  该图显示了时间（横坐标）和距离（纵坐标）之间的关系。|近义词：x-coordinate, horizontal coordinate|反义词: ordinate, y-coordinate|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *absis*, from Greek *ἀψίς (apsis)* meaning "arch, loop, vault".  Originally referred to the curved part of a church apse. The meaning shifted to "vault" and then to a mathematical curve, and finally to the horizontal axis of a coordinate system.

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The absis represents the horizontal position. = 横坐标代表水平位置。
The absis of this point is negative. = 这个点的横坐标是负数。

一般过去时:
The absis was measured using a ruler. = 横坐标是用尺子测量的。
The absis was calculated using the given formula. = 横坐标是用给定的公式计算出来的。

现在完成时:
The absis has been plotted on the graph. = 横坐标已经绘制在图表上了。
The absis has been identified as the independent variable. = 横坐标已被确定为自变量。

过去完成时:
The absis had been determined before the ordinate. = 横坐标在纵坐标之前就已经确定了。
The absis had been marked on the axis before the points were plotted. = 在绘制点之前，横坐标已经标记在轴上了。

将来时:
The absis will be used to calculate the slope. = 横坐标将用于计算斜率。
The absis will be plotted against the ordinate to create a graph. = 横坐标将与纵坐标一起绘制以创建图形。

虚拟语气:
If the absis were larger, the point would be further to the right. = 如果横坐标更大，该点将更靠右。
If we knew the absis, we could calculate the ordinate. = 如果我们知道横坐标，我们就可以计算纵坐标。

被动语态:
The absis is represented by the letter 'x'. = 横坐标用字母“x”表示。
The absis was calculated using the given data. = 横坐标是用给定的数据计算出来的。

疑问句:
What is the absis of this point? = 这个点的横坐标是多少？
How is the absis determined? = 横坐标是如何确定的？

否定句:
The absis is not always positive. = 横坐标并不总是正的。
The absis does not represent the vertical position. = 横坐标不代表垂直位置。

PHRASE->
absis of a point = 点的横坐标
on the absis = 在横轴上
along the absis = 沿着横轴
the absis represents = 横坐标代表
plotted on the absis = 绘制在横坐标上
