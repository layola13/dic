词源:
From the verb "to brown," meaning to turn brown, from the adjective "brown." The literary and firearm senses are derived from the surnames of Robert Browning and John Browning, respectively.  "Browning" as a noun referring to the act of becoming brown is a gerund, a verb form used as a noun.  "Brownings" can then be understood as the plural of this gerund, referring to multiple instances of browning or, in the literary context, the collective works of the Brownings.
