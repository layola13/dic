microseism: /ˈmaɪkrəʊˌsaɪzəm/ (UK) /ˈmaɪkroʊˌsaɪzəm/ (US)| n. |微震；轻微地震；地微震|A faint earth tremor caused by natural phenomena, such as waves impacting the shore, or by human activity, such as traffic or machinery.|例句：Microseisms caused by ocean waves are common along coastlines. 海浪引起的地微震在海岸线很常见。

例句：The construction site generated microseisms that were detected by nearby sensors. 建筑工地产生的微震被附近的传感器探测到了。|近义词：tremor, earth tremor|反义词: N/A|词性:noun

Etymology: micro- (small) + seism (earthquake) from Greek "seismos" meaning "shaking"
