nonrefracting:/ˌnɒnɹɪˈfræktɪŋ/ |adj.| 非折射的 | Not refracting; not capable of refracting light. | The nonrefracting material allowed the light to pass straight through. 这种非折射材料允许光直接穿过。|  The nonrefracting surface of the material made it ideal for the experiment.  这种材料的非折射表面使其成为实验的理想选择。|Synonyms: non-refractive, nonbending | Antonyms: refracting, refractive |adjective

Etymology->
non- (prefix):  from Latin *nōn* "not".
refract (verb):  from Latin *refringere*, from *re-* "back" + *frangere* "to break".
-ing (suffix):  forms present participles and adjectives.
