注意事项:
"im" itself isn't a word, but a common shortening of "I am" in informal writing and speech.  It's crucial to use the correct conjugation of "to be" according to the tense and context. The examples above highlight common errors when trying to use "I'm" in tenses where the full form "I am" needs to be conjugated differently (e.g., "I was," "I will be," etc.).
