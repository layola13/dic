ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- (expressing negation, reversal) + ordering (from order + -ing).  The prefix "dis-" comes from Latin, meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," expressing negation or reversal.  "Order" comes from Old French "ordre" and ultimately from Latin "ordo" meaning "row," "rank," "series."  "-ing" is a suffix forming present participles and gerunds.
