词源:
From Middle English *fus, *fuz, *fos, probably of imitative origin, related to Old French fust “tree trunk, wood,” fus “spindle,” fesser "to beat with a stick" and Middle Dutch fūse "spindle."  The meaning "fine down, fluff" is from 1844. The sense of "blurred image" is from 1962, probably influenced by frizz. The slang meaning "police officer" is from 1929, American English, perhaps from fuzzy-tail, a contemptuous term for a rookie officer or from fuzz on the face.
