ETYMOLOGY->
"anti-" (prefix meaning "against, opposed to") + "racketeering" (noun derived from "racket," meaning an illegal or dishonest scheme or business). "Racket" itself likely comes from the word "racquet," referring to the noise made by a racquet in sports, which was then metaphorically extended to noisy and disruptive activities, including criminal enterprises.
