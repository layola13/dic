词源:
From Middle English *burnischen, *brunischen, from Old French burnir, brunir (“to polish, make brown”), from Frankish *brunnjan, from Proto-Germanic *brunjaną (“to make brown, to burn”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰrewH- (“brown”). Related to brown.  The original sense was "to make brown," later extended to "polish" because polishing often darkens metal.
