acid-rains: /ˈæsɪd reɪnz/ | n. | 酸雨 | Rainfall made sufficiently acidic by atmospheric pollution that it causes environmental harm, typically to forests and lakes.  The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These gases react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These then mix with water molecules in the air and fall to the ground as acid rain. | Acid rains are devastating the Black Forest. 酸雨正在摧毁黑森林。

The acid rains have damaged the ancient sculptures. 酸雨损坏了古代雕塑。| 近义词: acid precipitation, acid deposition | 反义词: (No direct antonym, but one could consider "clean rain" or "normal rain" as a contrasting concept) | 词性: noun
