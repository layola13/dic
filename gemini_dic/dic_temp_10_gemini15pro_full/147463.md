ETYMOLOGY->

From over- + officious + -ness.  "Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much." "Officious" comes from the Latin "officiosus," meaning "ready to serve,"  which itself derives from "officium," meaning "duty" or "service."  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "overofficious" into the noun "overofficiousness."
