词源：From the science fiction novel *Stranger in a Strange Land* by Robert A. Heinlein, where it means "to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience."  It comes from the Martian word meaning "to drink."  The underlying implication is to absorb knowledge as if drinking it.
