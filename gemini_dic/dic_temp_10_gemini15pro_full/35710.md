Note: While grammatically "cocaines" exists as a plural, it's extremely rare and unusual in practical usage. "Cocaine" is typically used as a mass noun, even when referring to multiple instances or quantities.  Using the singular form is overwhelmingly preferred and considered correct in virtually all contexts.
