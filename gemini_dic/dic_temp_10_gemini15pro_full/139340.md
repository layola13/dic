ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *obscēnus, from Latin obscēnus (“inauspicious, ill-omened; foul, loathsome; indecent, obscene”), probably from ob (“against, before”) + *scaenum (“stage, scene; exhibition, show”), from Ancient Greek σκήνη (skḗnē, “stage, scene”). The sense development may have been influenced by scēna obscēna (“obscene scene”), referring to scenes of extreme violence and indecency in theatre, or by scēna obscēna (“offstage scene”), referring to a scene performed offstage because of its indecency, and hence supposedly even more obscene than anything actually seen.
