PHRASE->
(Due to the specific and somewhat unusual nature of "ossa's" – a Latin anatomical term in the plural possessive form – common phrases are difficult to construct naturally.  It's more likely to be encountered in scientific or technical contexts.)  Therefore, rather than forcing unnatural phrases, I offer examples of how one might encounter "ossa's" in a scientific context:

1. Examination of the ossa's density revealed... = 对骨骼密度的检查显示...
2. The ossa's structure is consistent with... = 骨骼的结构与...一致
3. Analysis of the ossa's composition indicated... = 对骨骼成分的分析表明...
4.  Further research into the ossa's origins... = 对骨骼起源的进一步研究...
5.  The ossa's preservation state allowed for... = 骨骼的保存状态允许...


词源:  Latin "ossa" (plural of "os," meaning "bone")


注意事项: "Ossa" is a Latin term and not commonly used in everyday English.  "Bones" is the standard English word. The possessive form "ossa's" is grammatically correct but rare, and using "of the bones" or "the bones'" would be more natural in most contexts.
