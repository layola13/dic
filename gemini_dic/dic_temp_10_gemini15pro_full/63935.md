epipolism:/ɪˈpɪpəlɪzəm/ | n. | 附加生长; 表面生长 |The development or growth of organisms on the surface of another organism, or the condition of being so attached.  |Barnacles exhibit epipolism, growing on the surfaces of whales and rocks. 藤壶表现出附生现象，生长在鲸鱼和岩石的表面。| 近义词: epiphytism, ectoparasitism | 反义词: endoparasitism | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Greek *epi- "upon, on" + *poli* "city".  Initially referring to the outer walls or fortifications of a city, the biological term has evolved to describe organisms growing on the surface of others. 词源：来自希腊语 *epi- “在...之上” + *poli “城市”。最初指城市的城墙或防御工事，生物学术语演变为描述生长在其他生物体表面的生物体。
