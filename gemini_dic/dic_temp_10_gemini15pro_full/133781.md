PHRASE-> (This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases. Since it is a formal and less frequently used adverb, creating common phrases feels forced and unnatural.  Therefore, focusing on demonstrating its usage within sentences across different tenses is more helpful and relevant.)

词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "genealogical" (relating to genealogy) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Genealogical" comes from "genealogy," ultimately from Greek "genealogia" (tracing of descent).
