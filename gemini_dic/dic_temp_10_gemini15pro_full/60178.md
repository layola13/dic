词源: From Latin *effetus* "that has given birth, exhausted by bearing," from *ex- "out" (see ex-) + fetus "offspring, pregnancy" (see fetus).  The original sense was literal "no longer fertile" (of soil or people), later figuratively "worn out, exhausted, weak."  The sense of "decadent, overrefined" developed from the mid-19th century.
