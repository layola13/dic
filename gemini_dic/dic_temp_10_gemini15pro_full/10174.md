Etymology: From Late Latin *apoplecticus*, from Greek *ἀποπληκτικός* (apoplēktikos, “struck down, causing apoplexy”), from *ἀποπλήσσω* (apoplēssō, “strike down, disable by a stroke”), from *ἀπό* (apo, “away from”) + *πλήσσω* (plēssō, “strike”).  Originally referred to a stroke, but the meaning expanded to encompass extreme anger because of the perceived similarities in physical symptoms.
