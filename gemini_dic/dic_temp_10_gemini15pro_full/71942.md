"Flid" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. It's possible that it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "fluid," "fled," "flit," or another similar word.
2. **Slang/regionalism:**  It might be a colloquial term used in a specific region or community.
3. **A technical term:**  It could be jargon from a specific field.
4. **A neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word.
5. **A proper noun:**  A name of a person, place, or thing.


If you can provide more context, like where you encountered the word, I might be able to offer more insights.
