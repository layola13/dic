aragonite: /əˈræɡənaɪt/ | n. | 文石 | A mineral species of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), crystallizing in the orthorhombic system. It is a polymorph of calcite and vaterite, meaning it has the same chemical composition but a different crystal structure. | Aragonite is a common component of pearls and coral skeletons.  文石是珍珠和珊瑚骨骼的常见成分。| Synonyms: none (as it's a specific mineral) | Antonyms: none | noun

calcite: /ˈkælˌsaɪt/ | n. | 方解石 | A common crystalline form of natural calcium carbonate (CaCO3), the basic constituent of limestone, marble, and chalk. | Calcite is a major component of many rocks. 方解石是许多岩石的主要成分。| Synonyms: calcspar | Antonyms: none | noun
