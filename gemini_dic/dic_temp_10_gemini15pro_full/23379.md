brachiopoda:/ˌbrækɪˈɒpədə/| n. |腕足动物门|A phylum of marine invertebrates, with a hinged shell and a lophophore for feeding.  They are also known as lamp shells.|Brachiopods are often mistaken for clams, but their internal anatomy is quite different.|近义词:lamp shell|反义词:None|noun


brachiopod:/ˌbrækɪəˈpɒd/| n. |腕足动物|Any of the marine invertebrates of the phylum Brachiopoda.|The fossil record shows that brachiopods were much more common in ancient seas.|近义词:lamp shell|反义词:None|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *brachiopoda*, from Ancient Greek βραχίων (brakhíōn, “arm”) + πούς (poús, “foot”).  The name refers to the arm-like lophophore used for feeding, which occupies much of the internal space of the shell.
