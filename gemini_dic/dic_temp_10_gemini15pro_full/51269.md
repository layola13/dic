近义词: aimlessly, haphazardly, erratically, randomly, fitfully
反义词: purposefully, systematically, methodically, diligently

词性: adverb

词源: From Latin *desultor* "leaper from one horse to another, circus rider," from *desilire* "to leap down," from *de-* "down" + *salire* "to leap." The original sense of "jumping from one thing to another" led to the meaning "inconstant, fickle," hence "aimless, haphazard."
