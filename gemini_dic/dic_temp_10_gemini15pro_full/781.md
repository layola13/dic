absorbances:/əbˈzɔːrbənsiz/| n. |吸光度|The measure of the capacity of a substance to absorb light of a specified wavelength. It is equal to the logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance.|The absorbances of the samples were measured at 540 nm.  样品的吸光度在 540 纳米处测量。

The researchers plotted the absorbances against the concentrations. 研究人员绘制了吸光度与浓度的关系图。|近义词：optical density, extinction|反义词: transmittance|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From absorb (v.) + -ance (suffix forming nouns from verbs).  Absorb comes from Latin absorbere "to swallow up," from ab- "away" + sorbere "to suck up."

USAGE->
The word "absorbances" is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry, physics, and biology, to discuss the absorption of light by substances.  It's typically used in the plural form as it often refers to multiple measurements.  Here are some example sentences illustrating its usage in different grammatical contexts:

一般现在时:
The spectrophotometer measures the absorbances of the solutions. = 分光光度计测量溶液的吸光度。
Different materials have different absorbances at various wavelengths. = 不同的材料在不同的波长下有不同的吸光度。

一般过去时:
The absorbances were recorded in a table. = 吸光度被记录在一个表格中。
We compared the absorbances of the treated and untreated samples. = 我们比较了处理过和未处理过样品的吸光度。


现在完成时:
The researchers have measured the absorbances at different time points. = 研究人员在不同的时间点测量了吸光度。
They have analyzed the absorbances to determine the concentration of the analyte. = 他们分析了吸光度以确定分析物的浓度。


过去完成时:
After the experiment was completed, the absorbances had been recorded. = 实验完成后，吸光度已被记录下来。
The scientists had compared the absorbances before publishing their findings. = 科学家们在发表他们的发现之前比较了吸光度。


将来时:
The absorbances will be measured tomorrow. = 吸光度将在明天测量。
We will compare the absorbances of the different samples next week. = 我们将在下周比较不同样品的吸光度。


被动语态:
The absorbances were measured by the students. = 吸光度由学生测量。
The results of the absorbances are being analyzed. = 吸光度的结果正在被分析。


疑问句:
What are the absorbances of these samples? = 这些样品的吸光度是多少？
Why are the absorbances so low? = 为什么吸光度这么低？


否定句:
The absorbances are not consistent. = 吸光度不一致。
The absorbances do not show a clear trend. = 吸光度没有显示出明显的趋势。


PHRASE->
high absorbances = 高吸光度
low absorbances = 低吸光度
measuring absorbances = 测量吸光度
comparing absorbances = 比较吸光度
analyzing absorbances = 分析吸光度
