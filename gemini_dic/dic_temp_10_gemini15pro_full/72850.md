Etymology:
"Folkest" is the superlative form of "folky," which is derived from "folk."  "Folk" comes from Old English *folc (meaning "people, nation, tribe"), from Proto-Germanic *fulka-, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *pleh₂- (meaning "to fill"). The suffix "-y" forms adjectives meaning "characterized by" or "full of."  The superlative suffix "-est" indicates the highest degree of a quality.
