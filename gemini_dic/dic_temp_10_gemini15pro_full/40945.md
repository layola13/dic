ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *coupen*, from Old English *cūpan* (“to keep, preserve, observe, regard”), from Proto-Germanic *kōpjaną* (“to buy, barter, trade”), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱewp- (“to accumulate, heap up, buy”).  The sense shifted from "keeping in a coop" to "being confined".  Related to Dutch *koopen* (“to buy”) and German *kaufen* (“to buy”).
