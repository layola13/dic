"barin" is not a standard English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language, a slang term, or a technical term from a specific field.  Since it's not a recognized English word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if you meant **"brain,"** then here's the analysis:

brain: /breɪn/ | n. | 大脑; 智力; 聪明人 | The control center of the nervous system.  Also used metaphorically to refer to intelligence or intellectual capacity. |  He has a good brain for business. 他有很好的商业头脑。| synonyms: mind, intellect, intelligence | antonyms: stupidity, foolishness | noun
