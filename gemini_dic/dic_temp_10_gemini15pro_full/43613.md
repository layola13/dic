词源: From "creaser" (one who or that which creates creases) + -'s (possessive suffix).  Ultimately from the verb "crease," from Old North French "cresser," meaning "to fold."

英文解析: "Creaser's" is the possessive form of "creaser," which can refer to a person who creates creases (like a tailor or someone who irons clothes) or a tool that creates creases.  More commonly, "creaser's" refers to the location or area of a crease itself, such as "the creaser's mark."  While less common than simply using "crease," "creaser's" emphasizes the area affected by the crease.
