2. **A proper noun:**  It could be a surname or place name.  If this is the case, general dictionary resources won't contain it.

3. **A neologism or slang term:** New words are constantly being created.  If "hangley" is a recent invention, it might not yet be documented.

4. **A technical term or jargon:**  Specific fields often have their own specialized vocabulary.
