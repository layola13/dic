cytode:/ˈsaɪ.toʊd/| n. |细胞质体|A non-nucleated, unicellular organism, considered a primitive form of life.  A mass of cytoplasm, capable of amoeboid movement. It lacks a definite nucleus and other organelles, and is considered a primitive or degenerate form of a cell.|Example 1: Some biologists believe cytodes represent an early stage in the evolution of cells.|例句 1：一些生物学家认为细胞质体代表了细胞进化的早期阶段。

|Example 2: The cytode moved slowly across the slide, engulfing smaller particles.|例句 2：细胞质体在载玻片上缓慢移动，吞噬较小的颗粒。|近义词:protoplasm,  |反义词: eukaryote (loosely) |noun
