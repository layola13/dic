词源: From bliss + -ful.  Bliss comes from Old English *bliþs (attested only in derivatives such as bliþsian "to rejoice"), from Proto-Germanic *blithiz (source also of Old Saxon blidsea "joy," Old High German blidida "kindness," Gothic bleiþs "merciful"), from PIE root *bhlei- "to shine, flash, gleam; to bloom." The original sense was "joy, happiness, grace."
