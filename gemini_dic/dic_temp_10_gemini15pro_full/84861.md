词源:  "Hanged-up" originates from the image of a telephone receiver being hung up on its cradle, thus ending a conversation and leaving the line busy. This image was extended metaphorically to describe a person who is mentally or emotionally stuck or preoccupied with something, as if their thoughts were "hung up" on a particular issue.  "Hanged" in this context refers to the past participle of "hang" meaning to suspend.


注意事项:
注意区分 "hanged" (用于人被绞死) 和 "hung" (用于悬挂物体)。 "Hanged-up" 总是用 "hanged."
