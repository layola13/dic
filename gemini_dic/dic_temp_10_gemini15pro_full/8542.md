anticeremoniously: /ˌæntisɛrɪˈmoʊniəsli/ | adv. | 非正式地；不拘礼节地；随便地 |  In a manner lacking ceremony; informally and without the usual politeness or formality. | He anticeremoniously dumped his bag on the floor. 他 unceremoniously 把包扔在地板上。|  informally, casually, unceremoniously, abruptly | formally, ceremoniously, politely | adverb

Etymology:
From anti- + ceremonious + -ly.  "Anti-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite of." "Ceremonious" comes from the Late Latin "caeremoniosus," meaning "full of ceremony," ultimately from Latin "caerimonia" (ceremony).  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "ceremonious" into an adverb.
