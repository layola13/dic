From French "retrancher" (to cut again, to fortify), from "re-" (again) + "trancher" (to cut), from Vulgar Latin "trincare" (to cut in three). The English word originally meant "to dig trenches around a military position," but the meaning expanded to include any kind of firmly established position, opinion, or habit.
