citigradae: /ˌsɪtɪˈɡreɪdiː/
n.
Citigrades
An obsolete taxonomic group within the Carnivora, typically comprising cats, hyenas, and civets, characterized by walking on their toes (digitigrade locomotion).
Citigradae is an obsolete taxonomic term referring to a group of carnivorous mammals.  It's no longer used in modern classification.
The term Citigradae is rarely used in modern scientific literature.
近义词: Feloidea (more modern and accurate)
反义词:  None (as it's an obsolete taxonomic term, there isn't a direct opposite)
词性: Noun


Etymology:
From Latin "citis" (swift) + "-gradae" (walking), referring to their digitigrade locomotion.
