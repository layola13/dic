PHRASE->
(No common phrases use "modal's."  Avoid using these contractions in formal writing or speech.)

注意事项:  The use of "modal's" (could's, should's, would's) is generally discouraged in formal English. It's considered colloquial or dialectical and often sounds awkward.  Stick to the full forms (could have, should have, would have) for better clarity and grammatical correctness.  While you might encounter these contractions in informal speech, avoid them in writing, especially academic or professional writing.
