Etymology:  This word appears to be a neologism or a relatively recent coinage, possibly formed from the prefix "de-" (indicating removal or negation) and a root related to "lenify" (to soothe or mitigate), with the suffix "-ical" forming an adjective.  However, its etymology is not firmly established in standard dictionaries.  Its usage suggests a meaning opposite to that of "lenify," thus signifying "to make harmful" or "causing harm."
