Etymology:
From imposing + -ness + -'s (possessive).  Imposing comes from the late Middle English verb "imposen," meaning "to lay on, inflict," which evolved from the Old French "imposer," derived from the Latin "imponere," meaning "to place upon, set, impose."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.  The final -'s denotes possession.
