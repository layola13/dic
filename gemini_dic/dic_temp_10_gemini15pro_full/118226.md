mercaptal:/mərˈkæptəl/
noun
缩硫醛；硫醇缩醛
A compound formed from a carbonyl compound and a thiol.  Specifically, it refers to the product of the reaction of a carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) with two thiol molecules.
The mercaptal was easily converted back to the ketone.  这个缩硫醛很容易转化回酮。
近义词:thioacetal
反义词: (No common chemical antonym)
词性:n.

ETYMOLOGY->
From *mercaptan* (a now-obsolete term for thiol, from Latin *mercurius captans* "seizing mercury," due to thiols' affinity for mercury) + *-al* (suffix forming nouns, often from verbs or adjectives).
