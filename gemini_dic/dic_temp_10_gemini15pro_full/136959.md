nonspeciously:/ˌnɒnspɪʃəsli/ | adv. | 非表面地，非虚饰地，真诚地 |  In a way that is genuine and not superficial; without speciousness.  Not deceptively or misleadingly. | He argued his case nonspeciously, presenting the facts clearly and honestly. 他真诚地陈述了自己的观点，清晰而诚实地 presented the facts clearly and honestly. | 近义词: genuinely, sincerely, honestly, truthfully, candidly | 反义词: speciously, deceptively, misleadingly, falsely | 词性: 副词

词源:  From non- + specious + -ly.  "Specious" comes from Latin "speciōsus" meaning "beautiful in appearance," from "species" meaning "appearance, form, kind." The prefix "non-" negates the meaning, resulting in "nonspecious" signifying "not having a deceptive appearance."
