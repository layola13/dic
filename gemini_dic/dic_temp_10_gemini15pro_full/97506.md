It's important to note that tag questions need to agree with the main verb's tense and subject.  Using "isn't it" indiscriminately is grammatically incorrect.


Since "ingit" is likely a non-standard word, there are no common phrases or idioms associated with it.  If it's meant to be "isn't it," it functions as a tag question and doesn't form phrases on its own.
