The word "buada" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or possibly from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, or what you believe it might mean, I may be able to offer some suggestions.

However, I can still demonstrate the format you requested using a valid English word: **axiom**.

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理;  格言;  定理 | A statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应与恐怖分子谈判，这是一条被广泛接受的公理。 | Example:  One of the key axioms of the theory is that individuals act rationally. 该理论的关键公理之一是个人行为是理性的。 | Synonym: principle, theorem,  truism | Antonym: paradox, fallacy | noun
