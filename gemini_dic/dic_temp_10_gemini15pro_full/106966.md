lacked-in:/læktˈɪn/ | adj. | 缺乏的，不足的 | Deficient or inadequate in a particular quality or attribute.  This is not a standard English word. It's likely a hyphenated construction created for a specific context to mean "lacking in." | The report was lacked-in detail. (This sounds unnatural.  Better: The report lacked detail. Or: The report was lacking in detail.) | 近义词: deficient, wanting, lacking | 反义词: sufficient, adequate | 词性: adjective

词源:  "Lacked" comes from the Middle English *lakken*, from the Middle Dutch *laecken*, meaning "to blame, to find fault with." Over time, the meaning shifted to "to be without" or "to be deficient in."  "-in" is a preposition indicating location or inclusion.  While "lacking in" is a common phrase, "lacked-in" as a single word is not standard.
