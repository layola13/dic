From Late Latin *Epicurēus, from Latin Epicūrus (“Epicurus”), from Ancient Greek Ἐπίκουρος (Epíkouros, “Epicurus”).  Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who advocated for a life of simple pleasures and the avoidance of pain. While his philosophy was more nuanced than simple hedonism, his name became associated with the pursuit of pleasure.
