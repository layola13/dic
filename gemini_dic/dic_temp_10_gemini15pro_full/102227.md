-itely (This is not a standalone word. It's a suffix.)
/ɪtli/ | suffix | -地，-式地 |  A suffix used to form adverbs from adjectives, indicating manner or degree.  Often corresponds to adjectives ending in -ite. |  Definitely, politely, finitely | N/A | N/A | suffix

There is no base word "itely". "-itely" is a suffix.  It derives from the French "-itement" and ultimately from the Latin "-itās," meaning "quality, state, condition."  This Latin suffix combined with the adverbial ending "-ment" to form the French "-itement."  Over time, this became anglicized to "-itely."
