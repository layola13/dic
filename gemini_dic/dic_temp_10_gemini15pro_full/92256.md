hypervariably:/ˌhaɪpərˈvɛəriəbli/| adv.|高度可变地，高度变异地|In genetics, it describes regions of genes (like antibodies) that mutate at a very high rate.|The antibody genes diversify hypervariably to recognize a wide array of antigens.|近义词：highly variably, extremely variably|反义词：invariably, constantly|词性: 副词

Etymology:
hyper- (Greek): prefix meaning "over, above, excessive"
