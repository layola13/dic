词源:  "bluesier" is the comparative form of "bluesy," which itself is derived from "blues," referring to a genre of music characterized by melancholy and often expressing sadness or hardship. The "-y" suffix is used to form adjectives, and "-er" is the standard comparative suffix in English.  "Blues" itself likely originates from the phrase "blue devils," meaning low spirits or melancholy.
