ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + fastidious + -ly.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much". "Fastidious" comes from the Latin "fastidium" meaning "loathing" or "disgust".  Therefore, "overfastidiously" describes an action performed with excessive attention to detail, often driven by a sense of disgust or dissatisfaction with anything less than perfect.
