注意事项:
The plural of chalaza is chalazae.
While "chalaziferous layer" is offered as a synonym, it more accurately describes the membrane that secretes the chalaza, rather than the chalaza itself.  The chalaza is a structure within this layer.
The word is derived from the Greek "khálaza," meaning "hailstone," likely referencing its small, white appearance.
