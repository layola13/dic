PHRASE->

(Because "mattins's" is a relatively specific and infrequent term, common phrases using the possessive form are less likely. The phrases below focus on the word "mattins" itself, demonstrating its typical usage.)

Attend mattins: 参加晨祷
Celebrate mattins: 举行晨祷
During mattins: 在晨祷期间
The music of mattins: 晨祷的音乐

注意事项:

The word "mattins" is already plural, referring to a service.  The possessive form "mattins's" is less common than simply "mattins'."  While grammatically correct, it can sound slightly awkward.  "Matins'" is a more frequently used alternative possessive form.
