注意事项: "go-and" is primarily used in spoken English and is considered informal. It’s less common in formal writing.  While it can imply impatience, it doesn't always have a negative connotation. Sometimes it simply emphasizes the action of going and doing something quickly.  It can be pronounced with varying degrees of emphasis on the "and," depending on the speaker's intention and regional dialect.
