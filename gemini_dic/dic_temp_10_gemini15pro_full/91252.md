hydroferricyanic:/ˌhaɪdrəfɛriˈsaɪənɪk/| adj.|六氰合铁(III)酸的；氢铁氰酸的|Containing or derived from hydroferricyanic acid (H3Fe(CN)6). This acid contains iron in the +3 oxidation state, hence the "ferri" prefix.  It forms salts called hexacyanoferrates(III) or ferricyanides.|Potassium hydroferricyanic is used in blueprint making.|近义词: ferricyanic|反义词: ferrocyanic|词性: adjective

Etymology->
From *hydro-* (water, hydrogen) + *ferri-* (iron(III)) + *cyanic* (containing the cyanide group, CN−). Ultimately from Greek *ὕδωρ* (hýdōr, “water”) + Latin *ferrum* (iron) and Greek *κύανος* (kýanos, “dark blue”).
