macromeric:/ˌmækrəˈmɛrɪk/| adj.|大分裂球的，巨球的|Relating to or designating a macromere, a large blastomere.  A macromere is one of the large cells formed during the early cleavages of the embryo, as opposed to a micromere, which is a smaller cell. |The vegetal blastomeres are much larger than the animal blastomeres, and are known as macromeres.| 近义词:megameric| 反义词:micromeric| 词性:形容词

From macro- (large) + -mere (part), ultimately from Greek *makros* (large) and *meros* (part).
