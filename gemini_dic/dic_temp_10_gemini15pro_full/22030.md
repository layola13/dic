The word "bokadam" doesn't appear to be a recognized word in any common English dictionaries or etymological resources. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism, a slang term, a dialectal word, or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.
