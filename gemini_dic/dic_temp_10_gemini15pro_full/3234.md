afferent:/ˈæfərənt/| adj. n.|传入的，输入的；传入神经；|Conducting or conducted inwards or towards something (for example, a nerve conveying impulses to the central nervous system).|Sensory neurons are afferent, carrying impulses towards the central nervous system.|近义词：incoming, inward, sensory|反义词:efferent, outgoing, motor|词性:adjective, noun

Etymology:
