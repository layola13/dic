Etymology:
From instrument + -ist.  "instrument" comes from Old French instrument, ultimately from Latin instrumentum "tool, implement, instrument," from instruere "to build, construct, prepare, arrange," from in- "in" + struere "to pile, build."  "-ist" is a suffix forming agent nouns, from French -iste and directly from Latin -ista, from Greek -istes.
