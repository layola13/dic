ETYMOLOGY->
From "blackbird" + "-er" (agent suffix). The term originated in the 19th century, referring to the practice of kidnapping or tricking Pacific Islanders (often darker-skinned) to work as laborers, particularly in Australia and the islands of the Pacific.  It alludes to the practice of capturing blackbirds.  It gained notoriety due to the often brutal and exploitative conditions these laborers faced, akin to slavery.
