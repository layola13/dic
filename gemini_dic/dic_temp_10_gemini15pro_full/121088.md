miscorrelations:/ˌmɪskɔːrəˈleɪʃənz/ | n. | 误相关，虚假相关 |  A spurious or misleading correlation between two variables that are not causally related.  It appears there is a relationship, but it's due to coincidence, a third unseen factor, or flawed data. | Example 1: There's a miscorrelation between ice cream sales and crime rates; both increase in the summer, but ice cream doesn't cause crime.  冰淇淋销售量和犯罪率之间存在误相关；两者都在夏季增加，但冰淇淋不会导致犯罪。

Example 2:  Researchers found a miscorrelation between shoe size and reading ability in children; older children tend to have larger feet and better reading skills, but foot size doesn't influence reading ability. 研究人员发现儿童的鞋码和阅读能力之间存在误相关；年龄较大的孩子的脚往往比较大，阅读能力也比较好，但脚的尺寸并不影响阅读能力。 | Near Synonyms: spurious correlation, false correlation, illusory correlation | Antonyms: true correlation, genuine correlation | noun
