instance of nonpropriety = 不得体的例子
marked by nonpropriety = 以不得体为特征
lapse in nonpropriety =  失礼的失误 (This phrase is a bit contradictory, as a "lapse" usually implies a temporary deviation from propriety, not nonpropriety itself. It might be better to say "lapse in propriety" to mean a temporary display of nonpropriety.)
