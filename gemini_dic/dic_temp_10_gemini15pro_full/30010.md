PHRASE->
(Due to the vulgar nature of the primary meaning, there aren't many common phrases using "cawk" in that sense.  For the sealant meaning, the verb form is more common).

cawk up (phrasal verb) =  to caulk something completely


注意事项:
Given the vulgar nature of one meaning of “cawk,” caution should be exercised in its usage.  The alternative spelling “caulk” is generally preferred for the sealant meaning.
