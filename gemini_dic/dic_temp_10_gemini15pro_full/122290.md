Etymology->
From French *mitraille*, from Old French *mitraille* "stone shot from a catapult," from Late Latin *mitralia*, plural of *mitrale*, alteration (influenced by Latin *mitra* "headband, turban") of *matralia* "bed covers," originally "mattress," from Latin *mater* "mother" (source also of Spanish *mitralla*). The sense development in Late Latin was from "mattress" to "padded covering" for siege engines, to "stone shot from a catapult." The modern sense of "small-arms projectiles" dates from the late 18th century.
