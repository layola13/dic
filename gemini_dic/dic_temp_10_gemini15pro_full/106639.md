kupfernickel:/ˈkʊpərˌnɪkəl/| n. |红砷镍矿;镍|A reddish-brown mineral consisting of nickel arsenide (NiAs), an important ore of nickel.  It was so named by German miners because it resembled copper ore (Kupfer) but yielded no copper, and they attributed this to the mischievous sprite Nickel (similar to "Old Nick").| Miners in Saxony originally called the ore Kupfernickel, because, while it looked like copper ore, it yielded none. | 近义词:niccolite| 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun
