Etymology:
From *glamour* + *-ous*.  *Glamour* originally meant a magical spell, an illusion of attractiveness.  It comes from Scottish *glamour*, a variant of English *grammar*. In earlier times, learning was associated with magic, so "grammar" (the study of language) came to be associated with magic spells.
