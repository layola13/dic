词源:
From "civilized" + "-ness" + "'s" (possessive).  "Civilized" ultimately comes from the Latin "civis" (citizen), reflecting the idea that civilized behavior is associated with living in a city or organized society.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "civilized" into the noun "civilizedness," indicating the state or quality of being civilized. The final "'s" indicates possession, belonging to the civilizedness.
