注意事项:
Since "heyen" isn't a standard English word, there isn't a formal etymology.  It's likely a variation or misspelling of "hey," which comes from Middle English "hei."  It's important to note that outside of specific contexts or dialects, "heyen" might not be readily understood.  Using "hey" or "hi" would be more universally accepted.
