ETYMOLOGY->
From "gas" + "cooled," the past participle of the verb "to cool." "Gas" originates from the Greek word "chaos," meaning "empty space," later evolving into its modern meaning through the work of Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont. "Cool" comes from the Old English "col," meaning "cold," with Germanic roots.
