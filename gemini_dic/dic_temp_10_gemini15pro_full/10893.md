araeometer:/ˌɛərɪˈɒmɪtər/ /ˌɛərɪˈɑːmɪtər/ | n. |比重计，液体比重计|An instrument for measuring the specific gravity of liquids. It typically consists of a sealed glass tube with a weighted bulb at one end that floats vertically in the liquid being measured. The specific gravity is determined by the depth to which the instrument sinks.|The winemaker used an araeometer to measure the density of the grape juice. 酿酒师用比重计测量葡萄汁的密度。

The brewer carefully lowered the araeometer into the fermenting wort.  酿酒师小心地将比重计放入发酵麦芽汁中。


|近义词：hydrometer, densitometer|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

Etymology:  From Greek *ἀραιός (araiós, “thin, sparse”) +  *-μέτρον (-métron, measuring instrument suffix).
