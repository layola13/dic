"nowd" is not a recognized English word.  It is likely a misspelling or a slang/dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you meant "nodded" or another word, please resubmit your request.

However, I can still provide information regarding the usage of "what" as requested, since the instructions seem to shift focus to this word.
