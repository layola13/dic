Etymology:
"Non-" (prefix) + "menial" + "-ly" (suffix)

"Non-" negates the meaning of the following word.
"Menial" originates from Old French "meignal, mesniel" meaning "household," from Medieval Latin "mansionale," ultimately from Latin "mansio" meaning "dwelling."  It came to refer to domestic servants and later to any work considered lowly or servile.
"-ly" is a suffix that forms adverbs.
