nonexpansive:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænsɪv/
adjective
非扩张的
(of a function or mapping) having the property that the distance between the images of any two points in the domain is no greater than the distance between the points themselves.  In simpler terms, it means a function doesn't increase the distance between points.
The function f(x) = x/2 is nonexpansive.  函数 f(x) = x/2 是非扩张的。

The projection onto a convex set is a nonexpansive mapping.  投影到凸集上是一个非扩张映射。

synonym:  contractive (in some contexts), Lipschitz continuous (with Lipschitz constant 1)
antonym: expansive
