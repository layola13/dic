The word "manzour" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, a proper noun, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context, like the language it's from or the sentence you saw it in, I can try to give you more information.

Since I can't analyze "manzour", I'll use the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
