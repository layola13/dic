branchiostegous: /ˌbræŋkiɒˈstiːɡəs/ | adj. |  鳃盖的，与鳃盖有关的 | Having a bony operculum or gill cover. Relating to or possessing a branchiostegal membrane. |  Example: Branchiostegous rays support the gill membrane in many fish. 许多鱼的鳃盖膜由鳃盖条支撑。

Example:  The branchiostegous membrane plays a crucial role in respiration for some aquatic species.  鳃盖膜对一些水生物种的呼吸起着至关重要的作用。 | Synonym: operculate | Antonym: (No direct antonym, but perhaps could be contrasted with "gill-less" for organisms lacking gills entirely) | Word type: Adjective

Etymology: From Greek *bránkhia* (gills) + *stégō* (to cover).
