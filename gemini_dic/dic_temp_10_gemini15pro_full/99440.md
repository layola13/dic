interest:/ˈɪntrɪst/| n. vt.|兴趣，利息；使…感兴趣|From Old French interesse "damages, interest," literally "that which is between," from Latin interesse "to be of importance, make a difference, be between," from inter- "between" + esse "to be." Originally a legal term, the financial sense emerged in the 15th century. The meaning "feeling of wanting to know or learn" developed from the idea of having a personal stake or concern in something (late 15c.).|I have a great interest in history. 我对历史很感兴趣。  The bank pays 4% interest on savings accounts. 这家银行的储蓄账户利息为4%。|近义词：concern, curiosity, stake (n.); engage, intrigue (v.)|反义词:apathy, indifference (n.); bore (v.)|词性:名词，动词
free:/friː/| adj. adv. vt.|自由的，免费的；免费地；释放|From Old English freo "free, exempt, not in bondage, acting of one's own will," also "noble, joyful," from Proto-Germanic *frijaz (source also of Old Frisian fri, Old Saxon vri, Old High German vri, German frei, Dutch vrij, Gothic freis), from PIE root *prijos "dear, beloved," hence "friend; free." The semantic development from "beloved" to "free" is unique to Germanic and is perhaps explained by "beloved" implying "belonging to the family or tribe," hence "not a slave."|The birds were set free. 鸟儿被放飞了。 The museum offers free admission on Sundays.  博物馆周日免费入场。|近义词：liberated, independent, complimentary|反义词:captive, restricted, costly|词性:形容词，副词，动词
