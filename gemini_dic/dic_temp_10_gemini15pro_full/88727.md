Etymology: From hobnob (verb), which originated in the late 16th century as hob or nob, meaning "to drink together," likely from the phrase "hab nab" (have or have not), inviting someone to share a drink whether they could afford it or not. It later evolved to mean "to socialize with," especially with those of higher social standing.
