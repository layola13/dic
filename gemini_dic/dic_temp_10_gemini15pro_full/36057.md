词源：
The origin of "codswallop" is uncertain, but it's thought to be related to Hiram Codd, inventor of the Codd-neck bottle, a type of sealed glass bottle used for carbonated drinks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  "Wallop" is a slang term for beer or other alcoholic drinks. One theory is that "codswallop" originally referred to drinks bottled in Codd-neck bottles, and later became a general term for nonsense, perhaps implying that the speaker is intoxicated or talking rubbish.
