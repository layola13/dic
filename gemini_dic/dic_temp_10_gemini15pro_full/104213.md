注意事项:

"Juran" is not a standard English word.  It likely comes from a transliteration of  a word from another language (possibly related to "jurar," the Spanish verb for "to swear").  As such, providing standard English synonyms and antonyms is challenging.  This analysis assumes it functions as a noun synonymous with "oath," "vow," or "pledge."  If the intended meaning is different, the analysis would need to be adjusted accordingly.
