hydrometrograph:/ˌhaɪdrəˈmɛtrəɡrɑːf/
noun
水位计，水位记录器
An instrument that automatically records the height or stage of water, typically in a river or reservoir, over time.
The hydrometrograph showed a significant rise in the river level after the heavy rain. 水位计显示暴雨后河流水位显著上升。

The hydrometrograph provided valuable data for flood forecasting.  水位计为洪水预报提供了宝贵的数据。

synonym: water level recorder, stage recorder, limnimeter
antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider terms related to manual measurement like "dip stick" or "sounding line," though these aren't true opposites.)
n.
