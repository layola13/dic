PHRASE->
(It's difficult to provide common phrases using "counterchanged" in its literal heraldic sense.  It's more often used metaphorically in modern English, and even then it's not a common word.  Therefore, the following phrases use the word in a more metaphorical and slightly adapted sense, focusing on the idea of exchange or reversal.)

1. counterchange roles: 交换角色
2. counterchange positions: 交换位置
3. counterchange ideas: 交换想法
4. counterchange plans: 改变计划 (less common)
5. counterchange strategies: 改变策略 (less common)
