Etymology:
From mouse + -y + -est.  The word "mouse" comes from Old English *mūs (akin to Old High German mūs, Latin mūs, Greek mûs), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *muHs-. The suffix "-y" forms adjectives meaning "characterized by" or "full of." The suffix "-est" is used to form the superlative degree of adjectives.
