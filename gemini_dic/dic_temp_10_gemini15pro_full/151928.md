注意事项:

词源:  "Pasti" comes from the Persian word "pasteh" (پسته), which refers to a type of confection or pastry.  Over time, the word has evolved and is now commonly used in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, to refer to a specific type of savory or sweet filled pastry.
