ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *cosinage*, from Old French *cousinage* "kinship, cousinship," from *cousin* "cousin". The semantic shift from "kinship" to "fraud" likely occurred through the notion of taking advantage of familial trust.  The verb "cozen" is a back-formation from the noun "cozenage".
