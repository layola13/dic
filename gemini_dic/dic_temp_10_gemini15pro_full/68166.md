注意事项:
"Fainer" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  It’s more likely to be encountered in older literature or poetry.  While grammatically correct in the various tenses, it often sounds unnatural in modern usage, especially in the continuous tenses.  Using more common synonyms like "happier," "more willing," or "keener" is generally recommended.
