"buke" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be slang, a regionalism, or from another language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered it, what was being discussed), I might be able to help.

If you meant "book," here's the analysis:

book: /bʊk/ | n. vt. | 书，书籍；预订，预约 | A written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers.  To reserve (accommodations, a place, etc.) in advance. |  例句：I read a book every week.  我每周读一本书。  例句：I booked a flight to London. 我预订了去伦敦的航班。 | 近义词：volume, tome (for n.); reserve (for vt.) | 反义词: (no direct antonym) | 词性: noun, verb
