homomorphic:/ˌhəʊməˈmɔːfɪk/ (US) /ˌhoʊməˈmɔːrfɪk/| adj.|同态的|Preserving the form or structure of something, especially in mathematics, where a homomorphic function preserves the relationships between elements in two different algebraic structures.|Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on ciphertext without decrypting it, resulting in an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext. |近义词: isomorphic (in some contexts), structure-preserving|反义词: non-homomorphic|词性:形容词
