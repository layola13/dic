ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *manufacture*, from Old French *manufacture*  "making by hand," from Latin *manu factus*, past participle of *manu facere* "to make by hand." From *manu*, ablative of *manus* "hand" + *factus*, past participle of *facere* "to do, to make."  The meaning shifted from "made by hand" to "made by machine" with the rise of industrialization.
