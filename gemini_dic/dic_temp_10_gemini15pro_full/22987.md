From Middle English *bounden*, past participle of *binden* (“to bind”), from Old English *bindan*, from Proto-Germanic *bindaną* (“to bind”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰendʰ- (“to bind”).  Cognate with Dutch *binden* (“to bind”), German *binden* (“to bind”), Icelandic *binda* (“to bind”).  The sense of "leap" arose from the idea of being "bound" or "springing" forward.
