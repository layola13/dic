n.|过度工程|The act of designing and building a product or system to be more robust or complex than is necessary.  It often involves adding features or functionalities that offer little or no practical benefit to the end-user while increasing cost and complexity.|The software was a classic example of overengineering – it could do far more than anyone needed.|近义词：overdesign, overcomplication, gold plating|反义词: underengineering, simplification|词性:名词
