ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *adoptionem (nominative adoptio), accusative of adoptio ("adoption"), from past participle stem of adoptare ("to choose for oneself, adopt"), from ad- ("to, toward") + optare ("to choose, wish, desire").

USAGE->
Due to its archaic nature and the prevalence of "adoption", "adeption" has very limited usage in modern English.  It's difficult to provide contemporary examples for different tenses and grammatical structures. Using "adoption" is strongly recommended.
