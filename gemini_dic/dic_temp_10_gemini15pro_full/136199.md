词源:
From non- + relevant.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "relevant" comes from the Latin "relevare," meaning "to lift, lighten, relieve." Thus, "nonrelevant" literally means "not lifting or lightening (the matter at hand)," implying it does not contribute to understanding or resolving the issue.
