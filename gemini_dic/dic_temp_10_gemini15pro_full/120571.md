ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *miri*, from Old English *myrge* (“pleasant, merry, sweet, agreeable, delightful, enjoyable”), from Proto-Germanic *murgijaz (“short, pleasant”).  Related to Old Norse *myrkr* (“darkness”). The superlative form *miriest* developed later through the regular English adjective comparison process.
