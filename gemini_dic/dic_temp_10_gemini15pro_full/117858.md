ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *melne, from Old French *melne, possibly from Latin *mel (honey) + a suffix indicating a product made with honey.  This is a reconstructed etymology, as the word is not well attested in extant sources. It may be a dialectal or obsolete form.  The modern word "mead" derives from Old English "medu" and is a more common term for honey wine.
