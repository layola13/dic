diode:/ˈdaɪoʊd/| n.|二极管|A semiconductor device with two terminals, typically allowing the flow of current in one direction only.  A diode acts as a one-way valve for electric current.|The radio uses a diode to detect the signal.|Synonyms: rectifier, valve|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, perhaps a short circuit?)|noun
