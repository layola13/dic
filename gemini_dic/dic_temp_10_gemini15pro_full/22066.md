bolik: /ˈboʊlɪk/ | adj. | 健壮的，强壮的 |  Of or relating to a strong, sturdy physique; robust.  This word is likely a recent coinage or a very localized/dialectal term, and its etymology is unclear.  It is not found in standard dictionaries.  Its resemblance to words like "bolic" (related to "bovine") or "bulk" might suggest a connection to size and strength, but without further evidence, this remains speculative. | Example: He had a bolik frame, capable of hard labor. 他有着健壮的体格，能够胜任艰苦的劳动。| Synonym: sturdy, robust, powerful, strong, muscular | Antonym: weak, frail, feeble | Word type: adjective
