词源:  The word "gerrymander" originated in the United States in 1812, when Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts signed a bill that redistricted the state to benefit his Democratic-Republican Party. One of the resulting districts was said to resemble a salamander, and a political cartoonist added wings, claws, and a head to emphasize its bizarre shape. The term "Gerry-mander" was then coined, combining Gerry's name with "salamander."
