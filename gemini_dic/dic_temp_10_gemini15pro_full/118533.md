mesognathous:/ˌmiːzoʊˈɡnæθəs/ | adj. | 中颌的 | Having a projecting face with a gnathic index between 98 and 103.  This describes a facial structure where the jaws are moderately prognathic, meaning they project slightly forward. |  Example 1: Mesognathous facial features are common in some populations. 中颌面部特征在某些人群中很常见。

Example 2: The skull was determined to be mesognathous based on measurements of the jaw. 根据颌骨的测量结果，确定该头骨是中颌的。 | Synonym:  moderately prognathic | Antonym: orthognathous, retrognathic | Adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From meso- (Greek: middle) + gnathos (Greek: jaw)
