ETYMOLOGY->
The phrase "ace up one's sleeve" likely originates from card games, particularly cheating.  "Ace" is the highest-value card in many games, and concealing one up one's sleeve would allow a player to introduce it at a crucial moment to win.  This practice became metaphorical for having a hidden advantage.  The earliest documented appearances of the phrase are in the mid-19th century.
