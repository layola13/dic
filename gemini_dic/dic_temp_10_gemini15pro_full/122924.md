molybdite: /məˈlɪbdaɪt/ | n. | 钼华 | A mineral consisting of molybdenum dioxide, MoO₂.  It occurs as soft, dark blue or black earthy masses, powder, or scales.| Molybdite is a rare secondary mineral found in oxidized molybdenum deposits. | 近义词: molybdic oxide | 反义词: None | 词性: noun

Etymology: From *molybdenum* + *-ite* (suffix used in mineralogy to denote minerals).  Molybdenum derives from the Greek word *molybdos* meaning "lead," as molybdenite (the principal ore of molybdenum) was originally confused with lead ore.
