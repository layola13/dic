词源:
From Middle English _sider_, from Old French _cidre_, from Late Latin _cīder_, from Ancient Greek _σίκερα_ (_síkera_), from a Semitic source akin to Hebrew _שֵׁכָר_ (_šēḵār_, “strong drink”).

注意事项:  Cyder is an older spelling of cider, more common in British English, particularly in the context of traditional or artisanal cider making.  In American English, "cider" is the standard spelling.
