paramorph:/ˈpærəˌmɔːrf/| n.|同质异形体，假象|A mineral that has the same chemical composition as another mineral but a different crystal structure.  A paramorph is a result of a complete change of the internal structure of a mineral without changing its external form. |例句：Aragonite is a paramorph of calcite. 文石是方解石的同质异形体。

例句：The gypsum is a paramorph after anhydrite. 石膏是硬石膏的假象。|近义词：pseudomorph|反义词:|noun
