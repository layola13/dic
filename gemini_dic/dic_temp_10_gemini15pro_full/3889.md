PHRASE->
Not applicable. "Agreeablenesses" is rarely used in common phrases.  Because "agreeableness" itself refers to a quality, it doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way that simpler words might.


词源:  From agreeable + -ness.  Agreeable traces back through Middle French agréable to Latin ad- 'to' + gratus 'pleasing'.
