词源:
The origin of "gubbins" is uncertain, but it's thought to be of Irish or Scottish Gaelic origin, possibly related to the Irish word "gobán," meaning a smith or metalworker.  This suggests a possible original meaning related to the bits and pieces of metalwork.  It entered English slang in the 19th century.
