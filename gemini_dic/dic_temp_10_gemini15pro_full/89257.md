hominin:/ˈhɒmɪnɪn/ /ˈhɑːmɪnɪn/| n.|人亚族|A subtribe of hominini that includes humans and their extinct ancestors after the split from chimpanzees.|The discovery of the fossil provided valuable insights into early hominin evolution.  这个化石的发现为早期人亚族进化提供了宝贵的见解。|Synonyms:  human ancestors|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, as it's a taxonomic classification)|noun

*(Note:  While *hominini* (人族) and *hominin* (人亚族) are very similar, there is a crucial distinction.  Hominini includes chimpanzees and gorillas, while hominin *excludes* them, referring only to the human lineage after the split from the chimpanzee lineage. This distinction is reflected in the examples and synonyms.)*
