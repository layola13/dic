ETYMOLOGY->
bacterio- + -scopic
bacterio- comes from Greek baktērion "small staff, rod," diminutive of baktron "staff, cane."  This refers to the shape of some bacteria.
-scopic comes from Greek skopein "to look at,"  related to skopos "watcher," and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *spek- "to observe."  It signifies "relating to observation or examination."
