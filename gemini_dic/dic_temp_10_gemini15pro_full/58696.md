词源:

From dumpiness + -'s (possessive).  Dumpiness itself comes from dumpy + -ness.  "Dumpy" originates from the  early 18th century, likely of imitative origin, suggesting a short, thick, or clumsy shape.

用法说明:

"Dumpiness's" is not a standard English word. While "dumpiness" exists as a noun meaning the state or quality of being dumpy, adding the possessive 's is grammatically unusual and rarely used.  It would only be used in very specific contexts to indicate possession belonging to the abstract concept of dumpiness, which is highly unusual.  It's much more natural to rephrase the sentence to avoid this construction.  For example, instead of "The dumpiness's of the dog...", you would say "The dog's dumpiness..."
