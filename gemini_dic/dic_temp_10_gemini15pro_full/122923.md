molybdic:/məˈlɪbdɪk/| adj.|钼的；含钼的|Containing or relating to molybdenum, especially in its hexavalent state.|Molybdic acid is a strong oxidizing agent. 钼酸是一种强氧化剂。|近义词: molybdenum-containing|反义词: N/A|词性:形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *molybdique*, from *molybdène* (molybdenum) + *-ique* (-ic).  Ultimately from Greek *μόλυβδος* (molybdos, “lead”), because molybdenite (the principal ore of molybdenum) resembles lead ore.
