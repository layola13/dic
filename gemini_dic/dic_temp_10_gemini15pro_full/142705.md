PHRASE->
(Note: "Otherwhile" doesn't readily form common phrases. It's generally used on its own as an adverb.)  It might be combined with phrases like "every otherwhile" meaning every so often, but this isn't a very standard usage.  Therefore, providing phrases with "sometimes" which is a close synonym:

sometimes soon = 不久以后
sometimes later = 过些时候
sometimes ago = 不久前
sometimes I wonder = 有时候我想知道
sometimes I think = 有时候我觉得
