hartshorn: n.
hartshorn: 鹿角, 氨水, 碳酸铵
hartshorn: Originally, hartshorn referred to a substance obtained from the antlers of a hart (a male red deer), which was used in various medicinal and household applications.  Later, the term came to be used for a solution of ammonia in water, also known as ammonia water or smelling salts, because of its similar pungent smell.  Now, it often refers to ammonium carbonate, a white crystalline powder used as a leavening agent in baking.
hartshorn: She used hartshorn to leaven her gingerbread cookies. 她用鹿角盐使她的姜饼膨胀。

hartshorn: synonym: ammonia, ammonium carbonate, baking ammonia, smelling salts
hartshorn: antonym: (No direct antonym, as it depends on the specific use.  For the leavening agent, perhaps "baking soda" or "yeast" could be considered alternatives.)
