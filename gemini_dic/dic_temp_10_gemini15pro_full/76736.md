词源：  "game-changing" is a compound adjective formed from the noun "game" and the present participle of the verb "change".  It originated in the late 20th century, likely from sports commentary, where it described a play or event that drastically shifted the momentum or outcome of a game.  It later broadened in meaning to encompass any significant shift in a given situation or field.
