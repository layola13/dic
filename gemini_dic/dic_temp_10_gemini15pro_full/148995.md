ovoviviparities:/ˌoʊvəˌvɪvɪˈpærɪtiz/ | n. | 卵胎生 |  A mode of reproduction in which embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother's body until they hatch. The embryos are nourished by the yolk, not by a placental connection. | Example 1:  Sharks exhibit ovoviviparity, with the young hatching inside the mother and then being born live. 鲨鱼表现出卵胎生，幼鱼在母体内孵化，然后活产。

Example 2:  Some species of snakes rely on ovoviviparity to protect their developing offspring from environmental hazards.  一些蛇类依靠卵胎生来保护它们发育中的后代免受环境危害。 | 近义词: aplacental viviparity | 反义词: oviparity, viviparity | 词性: noun
