注意事项:

An's is primarily a spoken contraction and is generally avoided in formal writing.  While grammatically correct, its usage depends greatly on context and register.  In some dialects, it may also represent "has".  Avoid using "an's" in formal writing or situations.  Stick to "is" or "has" for clarity.
