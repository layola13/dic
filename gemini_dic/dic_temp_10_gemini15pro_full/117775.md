词源: From Latin *meleagrinus, from meleagris (“guinea fowl, turkey”), from Greek μελεαγρίς (meleagrís).  The word ultimately traces back to the markings on the guinea fowl, which were likened to the spots on the Meleagrids (guinea hens) in Greek mythology.


注意事项: While "meleagrine" is a valid word, it is not commonly used in modern English. "Turkey" or "turkey-like" are much more frequent and readily understood.
