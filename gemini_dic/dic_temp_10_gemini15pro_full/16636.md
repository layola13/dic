Etymology: From French *baroque* "irregularly shaped pearl," from Portuguese *barroco,* Spanish *barrueco,* perhaps from Vulgar Latin *barra,* "bar." Originally used to describe pearls that were not perfectly spherical, the term later came to be applied to the elaborate and extravagant style of art and architecture that flourished in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.
