The word "danan" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun (like a place name), or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, if it's a name, I could help you find information about its origin or meaning.  If it's from another language, I could help you identify the language and find a translation.


If you meant "what" instead of "danan", here is the analysis:

what /wɒt/ (UK) /hwɑːt/ (US) |pron. det. interj. adv.| 什么，多么，多少 |Used to ask for information specifying something. |What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Which, how, who | N/A | pronoun, determiner, interjection, adverb
