allele:/əˈliːl/ | n. | 等位基因 | One of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome. | Example 1: The gene for eye color has several alleles, including those for brown, blue, and green eyes.  基因的等位基因决定了眼睛的颜色，例如棕色、蓝色和绿色。

Example 2:  Individuals inherit two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. 个体从父母双方各遗传一个等位基因，构成一对等位基因。 | Synonym: variant, version | Antonym: N/A (Alleles are different versions of the same gene; there isn't a direct opposite.) | noun
