"Chiragrical" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a constructed word, possibly intended to mean "surgical," based on the roots "chiro-" (hand) and "-urgical" (relating to surgery). While understandable in context, it's important to note that using this word in formal or professional settings may lead to confusion as it is not recognized.  The analysis provided above is based on the likely intended meaning.  Using the standard word "surgical" is recommended.
