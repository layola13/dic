nematoblast:/ˈnɛmətəˌblæst/| n. |刺丝囊，刺细胞|A stinging cell, characteristic of coelenterates (like jellyfish and anemones), containing a nematocyst.|The jellyfish's nematoblasts fired upon contact, injecting venom into its prey.|近义词：cnidoblast, stinging cell|反义词: None|词性:noun

Etymology: From *nemato-* (Greek: "thread") + *-blast* (Greek: "bud" or "germ," referring to a formative cell).  The word refers to the thread-like structure within the cnidoblast that delivers the sting.
