interresistance:/ˌɪntərɪˈzɪstəns/ | n. |相互电阻，互阻| The interresistance between the two wires was negligible. 两根导线之间的互阻可以忽略不计。| English explanation: The resistance between two distinct electrical circuits or components.  It often refers to the resistance encountered when current flows between two separate circuits or parts of a circuit, rather than through a single, continuous path.| Example 1: The interresistance between the components needs to be measured accurately.  组件之间的互阻需要精确测量。

Example 2: High interresistance can cause signal loss in electronic devices.  高互阻会导致电子设备中的信号损失。 | Synonym: mutual resistance, coupling resistance | Antonym: conductivity, conductance | Noun
