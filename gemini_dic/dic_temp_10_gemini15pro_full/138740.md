PHRASE->
(Not applicable - 'numbly' is typically not used in set phrases. It describes a state of being rather than forming part of a fixed expression.)


词源: From numb + -ly.  "Numb" comes from Old English *numen, past participle of *namian "to take, seize, benumb," related to Old Norse nema "to take," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *nemaną.
