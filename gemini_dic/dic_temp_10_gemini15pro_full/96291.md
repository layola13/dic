词源:  Likely a neologism (newly coined word) possibly blending "in-" (not) + "dividual" (separate/distinct) + "-ful" (full of) + "-vin" (possibly influenced by "win" or the Latin "vincere" - to conquer), suggesting a state where neither side fully conquers or achieves a distinct win.  Its usage is not widely established.
