词源：From Middle English *mewes, from Old French muer (“to molt, mew”), from Late Latin mūtāre (“to change”), from Latin mūtō (“I change”). The original meaning referred to the royal hawk mews, where hawks molted or shed their feathers.  Over time, the term came to refer to the stables themselves, and later to the narrow streets where such stables were located.
