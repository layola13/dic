PHRASE->
(Hellenically itself doesn't form common phrases in the way single words like "what" do.  It's primarily an adverb describing *how* something is done, not a component of fixed expressions. Therefore, providing phrases in the same way as the example for "what" isn't applicable.  Instead, I've provided some examples of how it can be used in context.)
