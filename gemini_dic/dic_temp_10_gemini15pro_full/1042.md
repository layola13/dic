accelerograph: /əkˈsɛləroʊɡræf/
noun
加速度仪，强震仪
An instrument that measures and records the acceleration of ground motion during an earthquake.
The accelerograph recorded the intense shaking of the earthquake.  这台加速度仪记录了地震的强烈震动。

The accelerograph provided valuable data for analyzing the earthquake's impact on buildings. 这台加速度仪为分析地震对建筑物的影响提供了宝贵的数据。

synonym: seismograph, strong-motion seismograph
antonym: N/A
n.


ETYMOLOGY->
From accelero- (indicating acceleration) + -graph (indicating a recording instrument).  Accelero- comes from Latin accelerare "to hasten," and -graph comes from Greek graphein "to write."


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The accelerograph measures ground acceleration. = 加速度仪测量地面加速度。
The accelerograph records the data for later analysis. = 加速度仪记录数据以便后续分析。

一般过去时:
The accelerograph recorded the peak ground acceleration during the earthquake. = 加速度仪记录了地震期间的峰值地面加速度。
The accelerograph malfunctioned during the aftershocks. = 加速度仪在余震期间发生故障。


现在完成时:
The accelerograph has recorded several earthquakes this year. = 今年，这台加速度仪已经记录了几次地震。
Scientists have used the accelerograph data to improve building codes. = 科学家们利用加速度仪数据改进了建筑规范。

过去完成时:
The accelerograph had recorded several smaller tremors before the main earthquake struck. = 在主震发生之前，加速度仪已经记录了几次较小的震颤。
The engineers had installed the accelerograph just weeks before the earthquake. = 工程师们在地震发生前几周才安装了加速度仪。

将来时:
The new accelerograph will be installed next week. = 新的加速度仪将于下周安装。
The accelerograph will record data from any future earthquakes in the area. = 加速度仪将记录该地区未来任何地震的数据。

虚拟语气:
If we had an accelerograph, we would have more data on the earthquake. = 如果我们有加速度仪，我们就会有更多关于地震的数据。
I wish we had installed the accelerograph sooner. = 我希望我们早点安装加速度仪。

被动语态:
The accelerograph was installed on the top floor of the building. = 加速度仪安装在大楼的顶层。
The data from the accelerograph is being analyzed by seismologists. = 地震学家正在分析加速度仪的数据。

疑问句:
Where is the accelerograph located? = 加速度仪位于哪里？
How does the accelerograph measure ground acceleration? = 加速度仪如何测量地面加速度？

否定句:
The accelerograph did not record any vertical movement. = 加速度仪没有记录任何垂直运动。
The accelerograph is not sensitive enough to detect small tremors. = 加速度仪不够灵敏，无法探测到小震颤。


PHRASE->
data from the accelerograph = 来自加速度仪的数据
installing the accelerograph = 安装加速度仪
the accelerograph recorded = 加速度仪记录了
a new accelerograph = 一个新的加速度仪
the accelerograph malfunctioned = 加速度仪发生故障
