nonconstituents:/ˌnɑːnˈkɑːnstɪtʃuənts/ | n. | 非成分，非组成部分 | Elements or groups of words that do not form a syntactic unit within a sentence.  They are not considered to be a single meaningful unit within the grammatical structure. | The words "the" and "dog" individually are nonconstituents in the phrase "the big dog" because the meaningful unit is "the big dog", not its individual parts. 这句话中，“the”和“dog”单独来看在短语“the big dog”中是非成分，因为有意义的单位是“the big dog”，而不是它的各个部分。

The words "ran" and "quickly" are nonconstituents in the phrase "ran very quickly" because "very quickly" is the adverbial phrase modifying "ran".  "ran" and "quickly" individually don't function as a single unit of meaning in the sentence.  单词“ran”和“quickly”在短语“ran very quickly”中是非成分，因为“very quickly”是修饰“ran”的状语短语。“ran”和“quickly”单独来看在句子中并不构成一个单独的意义单位。 | 近义词: non-elements, fragments | 反义词: constituents, components | 词性: noun
