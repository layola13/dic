Etymology:
From Old English *lagu "law" (attested only in compounds) + -ed, a suffix indicating the past participle or forming an adjective.  The Old English word is from Proto-Germanic *laguz (source also of Old Norse lǫg, Old Frisian lag, Middle Dutch lach, Old High German lagu, German Lage), from Proto-Indo-European *legh- "to lay, lie down, put."  The sense evolution is from "that which is laid down" to "law."
