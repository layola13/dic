haemapophysis:/ˌhiːməˈpɒfɪsɪs/
noun
血突，脉弓
A lateral process of a caudal vertebra of many fishes, which bears the caudal artery and vein.  It is an important skeletal element for the support and protection of the caudal blood vessels in fish.
The haemapophyses of the fish were clearly visible under the microscope. 在显微镜下，这条鱼的血突清晰可见。
Synonyms: haemal arch, haemal spine
Antonyms:  (No direct antonym exists. It is a specific anatomical structure.)
n.
