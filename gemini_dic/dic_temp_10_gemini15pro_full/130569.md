nonactivations: /ˌnɒnˌæktɪˈveɪʃənz/ (UK) /ˌnɑːnˌæktɪˈveɪʃənz/ (US) | n. | 非激活，未激活 |  The absence of activations; instances where something is not activated or turned on.  This word is usually used in technical contexts, especially in machine learning and neuroscience, referring to neurons or units that don't fire or activate. | The analysis of nonactivations in the neural network revealed important insights into the model's behavior. 对神经网络中非激活的分析揭示了对模型行为的重要见解。|  The high number of nonactivations suggests a problem with the input data. 大量的非激活表明输入数据存在问题。 | synonyms: inactivations, deactivations | antonyms: activations | noun
