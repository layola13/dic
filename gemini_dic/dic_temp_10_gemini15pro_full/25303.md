注意事项:

* The word "buggering" and its related forms are considered highly offensive in some contexts, particularly when referring to the sexual act. Use with extreme caution.
* The more casual uses of "bugger" are still considered mild swear words in many situations.

The word has a complex etymology, possibly originating from the Bulgar people, historically associated with heresy.  Over time, it became a derogatory term and eventually took on its current meanings.
