词源:  From Thai นง (nong), a respectful term of address for a younger sibling or someone considered younger. While often translated as "farmer," it more accurately reflects a rural or agricultural association than specifically being a farmer.  Its adoption into English is likely through cultural exchange and exposure to Thai society.
