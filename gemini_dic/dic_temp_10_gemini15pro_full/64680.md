词源：
From French escapade, from Spanish escapada “escape, flight,” from escapar “to escape,” from Vulgar Latin *excappare, from Latin ex- “out” + cappa “cape, cloak.”  The original sense was of a "breaking loose," referring to a sudden escape from confinement or restraint.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any adventurous outing or mischievous prank.
