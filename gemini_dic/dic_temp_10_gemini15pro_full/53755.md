ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *desconfit, past participle of desconfire "to defeat, rout, undo," from des- "expressing reversal" + con- "together" + faire "to do, make," from Latin facere "to do, make."  The original meaning was "to defeat utterly," but the meaning shifted to "to frustrate the plans of" and then to the current sense of "to make uneasy or embarrassed."
