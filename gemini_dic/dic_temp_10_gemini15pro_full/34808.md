ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *clime*, from Old French *climat*, from Latin *clīma, clīmatis*, from Ancient Greek *κλίμα* (*klíma*) "inclination, slope, zone, region," from *κλίνω* (*klínō*) "I lean, incline, bend."  The original sense referred to the supposed slope of the earth from the equator towards the poles, and hence to a region of the earth. The sense evolved to refer to the typical weather conditions of a region.
