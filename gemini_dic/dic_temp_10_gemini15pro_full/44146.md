crith: /krɪθ/ | n. | 克立斯 (质量单位) | A unit of mass used in chemistry, equal to the mass of one liter of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure.  It is now largely obsolete, replaced by the mole. |  The crith was a useful unit for comparing the densities of gases. | 近义词:  (No direct modern equivalent, as the unit is obsolete.  Perhaps "atomic mass unit" in a very loose sense, though not directly comparable.) | 反义词:  (None) | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Greek *krithe* (κριθή), meaning "barleycorn." The unit was originally defined as the mass of a liter of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure, which was thought to be approximately the mass of a barleycorn.
