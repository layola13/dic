词源: From Middle English *cobille, from Old North French coble, from Late Latin caupulus (“small boat”), diminutive of caupus (“cup, bowl”).  Related to Dutch kobel (“basket”) and German Kübel (“tub, bucket”). The sense "cobblestone" arose from the resemblance of such stones to the rounded bottom of a coble.
