**词源:**

Likely a combination of "langet" (a strap, thong, or strip of metal) and "gate."  While "langet" is somewhat archaic, it suggests the idea of a fastening mechanism for a gate. This etymology is speculative as "langate" isn't a widely recognized word in standard dictionaries. It may be a dialectal term, a historical term, or even a newly coined word.
