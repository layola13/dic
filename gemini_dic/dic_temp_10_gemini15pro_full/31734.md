词源:
cheap (adj.) Old English *ceap "bargain, purchase, sale, market," from Proto-Germanic *kaupon (source also of Old Saxon kop, Old Frisian keap, Middle Dutch coop "trade, bargain," Dutch koop "purchase," Old High German kouf "purchase, price," German Kauf "purchase," Gothic kaupon "to trade, traffic"), from PIE root *kau- "to cut, strike, hew." The original sense is of something acquired by barter. The meaning "low in price" developed in Middle English. Cheapskate is from 1912.

-ly (adv.) Old English -lice, from Proto-Germanic *-liko (source also of Old Saxon -liko, Old Frisian -like, Dutch -lijk, Old High German -licho, German -lich, Gothic -leiko), from PIE *-likos, adjectival suffix, from root *leg- (1) "to collect, gather."
