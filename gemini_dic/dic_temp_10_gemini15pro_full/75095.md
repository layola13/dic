词源: From Middle English *frim, *friȝm, from Old Norse *fríðr (“beautiful, fair”), from Proto-Germanic *frīþuz (“peace, friendship, love”). Cognate with Danish fred (“peace”), Swedish frid (“peace”), Icelandic friður (“peace”). Related to free.  The semantic development from "beautiful, fair" to "strong, firm" is unusual.  One theory suggests it might be related to the idea of "sound, healthy" (as in a "fair" complexion).


注意事项:

frim 并非一个标准的现代英语词汇，更多的是在一些方言或古英语中使用，其含义和用法与 firm 非常接近。在现代英语中，建议使用 firm。
