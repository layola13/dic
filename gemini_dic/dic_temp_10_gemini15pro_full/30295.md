注意事项:

"Cender" is not a standard English word.  It likely stems from a misspelling or mishearing of "sender."  While used occasionally in some contexts (perhaps informally or with a specific, localized meaning), it is not generally recognized.  The analysis provided above is based on the presumed intended meaning related to gift-giving.  For accurate communication, using standard words like "giver," "donor," "sender," or "benefactor" is recommended.
