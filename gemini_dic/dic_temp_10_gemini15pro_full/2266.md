ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *adely, from Old French *adelment, from *adel (noble), ultimately from Latin *agilis.  (This is a reconstructed etymology, as the word "adely" isn't attested in standard Middle English or Old French dictionaries. It seems to be a relatively modern formation, possibly a variant of "adeptly," influenced by words like "nobly".)
