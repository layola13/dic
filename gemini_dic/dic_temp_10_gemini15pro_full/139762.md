octaemeron: /ˌɒktɪˈɛmərɒn/ | n. |八日谈，八日故事集 | A collection of stories or other works designed to occupy eight days, especially Boccaccio's *Decameron*, which spans ten days but is sometimes mistakenly referred to as an octaemeron. | Example:  Although the title suggests eight days, the actual narrative of the *Decameron* unfolds over ten, leading to occasional mislabeling as an octaemeron. | Example: Some scholars argue that the structure of certain medieval narratives hints at an intended octaemeron, despite the final work encompassing a different timeframe. | 近义词: Decameron, anthology, collection | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, could consider "monograph" for a single, extended work) | 词性: noun
