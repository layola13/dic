The scientists were examining the destructibility of the material when the accident occurred. 科学家们正在检查材料的可破坏性时，发生了事故。(Focuses on the ongoing examination at a point in the past)


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The engineers had determined the bridge was destructible before the earthquake.  在地震发生之前，工程师们就已经确定这座桥是可摧毁的。
The report had indicated the material was highly destructible.  报告指出这种材料非常易碎。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
They had been testing the destructibility of the material for months before they published their findings.  在公布他们的发现之前，他们已经测试了几个月的材料的可破坏性。
The team had been analyzing the destructibility of the structure for some time before the demolition.  在拆除之前，团队已经分析了该结构的可破坏性一段时间。
