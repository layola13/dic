ETYMOLOGY->
From achieve + -ance.  "Achieve" comes from Old French "achever" meaning "to finish, complete, carry out," ultimately from Latin "ad caput venire" meaning "to come to a head, be finished."

USAGE->
This word is considered archaic or rare.  While grammatically correct, "achievement" is the more commonly used and preferred term.  Therefore, providing usage examples for various tenses feels artificial and potentially misleading.  It's best to use "achievement" in modern English.
