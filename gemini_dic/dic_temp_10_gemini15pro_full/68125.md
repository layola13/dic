注意事项:

The primary usage of "fagots" in modern English is as a derogatory and offensive slur against gay men. Its original meaning as "bundle of sticks" is archaic and rarely used.  Using this word is highly discouraged due to its offensive connotations.  Always choose alternative words like "kindling" or "firewood" instead.
