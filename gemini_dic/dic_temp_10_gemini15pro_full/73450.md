词源:

From Middle English *fornenst, *forneist, equivalent to *forne +‎ -en +‎ -st.  *Forne is from Old English forne (“before, in front of”); related to foran.  Compare fore.  The suffix -st is a superlative suffix.  Compare amongst, against.

用法说明:

Forenenst is an archaic or dialectal preposition primarily used in Scottish English and some northern dialects of English. It means "opposite to," "facing," or "in front of."  While it shares similarities with "opposite," "facing," and "before," it carries a more direct sense of being immediately in front of something.
