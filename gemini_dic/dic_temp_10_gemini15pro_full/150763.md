ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "parade" (noun) and "parader" (verb), from Spanish "parada" (stop, halt, act of parrying), from "parar" (to stop, parry), from Latin "parare" (to prepare, provide).  The sense of a military display evolved from the idea of troops being prepared for inspection. The more general sense of a public procession developed later.
