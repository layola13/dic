ETYMOLOGY->
From Anglo-French *felonos, from felon "felon, traitor, wicked person," from Medieval Latin fellonem (nominative fello) "evil-doer, traitor," of uncertain origin. Possibly from Frankish *fillo "thief," or from Gaulish *fello- "bad, wicked."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
