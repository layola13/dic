Etymology:
From hyper- + confidence.  Hyper- is a prefix meaning "over, excessive," from Greek hyper "over, beyond." Confidence is from Latin confidentia "trust, reliance, assurance," from confident- (stem of confidens), present participle of confidere "to have full trust or reliance, believe firmly, rely confidently," literally "to trust together," from com- "together" (see com-) + fidere "to trust" (see faith).
