词源:  The word "habnab" is of uncertain origin, possibly from a dialectal variation of "happen."  One theory suggests it might be related to the idea of grabbing a quick bite "as it happens" or when the opportunity arises. Another theory posits a connection with "hab nab," an old phrase meaning "have or have not," suggesting a casual, unplanned meal.
