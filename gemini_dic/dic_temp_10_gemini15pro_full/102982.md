ETYMOLOGY->
"Jee" originates as a euphemistic pronunciation of "Jesus," often shortened to "gee." This likely arose from avoiding taking the Lord's name in vain.  Similar euphemisms include "gosh" and "golly."


注意事项:  As "jee" is informal and considered a euphemism, it's generally not appropriate for formal writing or situations.
