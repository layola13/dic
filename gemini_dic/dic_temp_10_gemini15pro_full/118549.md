mesonephric:/ˌmezəˈnɛfrɪk/ | adj. | 中肾的；沃尔夫体的 | Relating to the mesonephros, the middle of the three pairs of embryonic renal organs in vertebrates.  The mesonephros functions in excretion and as the male reproductive organ in fish and amphibians, but in higher vertebrates it atrophies as the permanent kidney (metanephros) develops. | The mesonephric duct develops into parts of the male reproductive system. 中肾管发育成男性生殖系统的一部分。 |  mid-kidney, Wolffian |  metanephric | adjective
