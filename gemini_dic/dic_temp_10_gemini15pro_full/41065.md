词源:  "Copout" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the mid-20th century.  "Cop" in this context likely meant "to seize" or "to take," and "out" suggested an escape or exit. Therefore, "copout" initially implied seizing an opportunity to escape or withdraw from a difficult situation or commitment.
