ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cynosūra, from Ancient Greek κυνόσουρα (kunósoura, “dog’s tail, Ursa Minor”), from κύων (kúōn, “dog”) + οὐρά (ourá, “tail”). Originally referring to the constellation Ursa Minor, particularly Polaris, the North Star, which was used for navigation.  Because sailors used it to guide their ships, it became associated with something that serves as a guide or a center of attention.
