PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Halfflatteringly" is not typically used in set phrases.  It functions primarily as a standalone adverb.

词源: "Half" + "flatteringly".  "Flatter" comes from the Old French "flater" meaning "to stroke, caress."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb "flatter" into an adverb.
