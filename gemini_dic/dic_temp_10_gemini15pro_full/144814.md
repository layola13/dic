Etymology:
"Over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *ubar) meaning "above, across, beyond" + "honor" (from Old French honor, from Latin honor, honos). The prefix "over-"  indicates an excess or surpassing of a limit.  Therefore, "over-honoring" implies an excessive degree of honor being given.
