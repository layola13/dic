注意事项：

"Areally" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a blend of "really" and "actually." While it might be used in informal spoken English, it is not recommended for formal writing or academic contexts.  This analysis is based on the likely intended meaning, assuming it's used as a synonym for "really."  It's important to use "really" instead in standard English.
