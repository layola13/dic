heterothermy:/ˈhɛtərəʊθɜːmi/ (US) /ˈhɛt̬əroʊθɜːrmi/| n. |变温性，异温性|The ability of an organism to regulate its body temperature to some extent, but not as well as a homeotherm.  An animal that exhibits heterothermy is a heterotherm. |Bats exhibit heterothermy, allowing their body temperature to drop when they are inactive.|近义词：poikilothermy|反义词：homeothermy|词性:noun


Etymology: From Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, “other, different”) + θερμός (thermós, “warm, hot”).
