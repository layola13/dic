The word "bedagat" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or etymological resources. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism, a dialectal word, or from a specialized field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, or if you perhaps misspelled it, I might be able to offer more assistance.


However, as per your request, I can illustrate the format with a common English word, "ask":
