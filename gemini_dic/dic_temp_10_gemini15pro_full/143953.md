outquencher:/aʊtˈkwɛntʃər/
n.|熄灭剂，抑制剂|A substance that suppresses or counteracts the effect of another substance, especially one that quenches fluorescence or other luminescence.|The researchers developed a new outquencher to improve the sensitivity of their assay.|近义词：inhibitor, suppressor, quencher|反义词:activator, enhancer|词性:名词

词源:  "out-" (prefix meaning exceeding or surpassing) + "quench" (from Old English *cwencan, related to Old High German quinkan "to extinguish") + "-er" (suffix forming agent nouns).  Essentially, something that quenches more effectively or completely.
