ajog:/əˈdʒɒɡ/| adv. adj.|慢跑的，慢跑地|Moving at a slow, steady trot; slightly ajar.|The door was ajog, and I could hear them talking. 门半开着，我能听到他们在说话。|近义词：jogging, running slowly, ajar, open slightly|反义词:still, closed, shut|词性:副词，形容词
词源: From a- + jog.  "A-" is a prefix meaning "on" or "in a particular state or manner," and "jog" means to run at a slow, steady pace. So, "ajog" literally means "on a jog" or "in a jogging state." This meaning evolved to also describe something slightly open, like a door, perhaps because it resembles the slightly off-center position of a jogging gait.
