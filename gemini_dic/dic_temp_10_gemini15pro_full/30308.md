PHRASE-> (Since "cens" is a prefix, it doesn't form phrases in the same way a full word does. However, here are some examples of how it's used in word formations that express nuances of meaning):

censure severely = 严厉谴责
censure formally = 正式谴责
censure publicly = 公开谴责
vote of censure = 不信任投票
motion of censure =  谴责动议


注意事项:

This prefix doesn't have a pronunciation on its own.  It takes on the pronunciation of the word it's attached to.
