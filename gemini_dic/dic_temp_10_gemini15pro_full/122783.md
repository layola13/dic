molasse:/məˈlæs/ | n. | 软砂岩，磨拉石 | A sedimentary rock formed from eroded material from a mountain range. It typically consists of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. | The molasse deposits in the foreland basin provided valuable clues about the uplift history of the Himalayas.  喜马拉雅山前陆盆地的磨拉石沉积物为了解喜马拉雅山的隆升历史提供了宝贵的线索。

The molasse formation is characteristic of eroded mountain ranges.  磨拉石的形成是侵蚀山脉的特征。| synonym: conglomerate, sandstone | antonym: bedrock | noun
