词源： "over-" (prefix meaning "excessive") + "weaknesses" (plural of "weakness")


This word is not common and might be considered informal or even awkward.  Focusing on "weaknesses" is common, but adding "over" implies an excessive or perhaps inaccurate emphasis on them.  Using synonyms like "overstated shortcomings" or "excessive focus on minor flaws" might be more natural and effective.
