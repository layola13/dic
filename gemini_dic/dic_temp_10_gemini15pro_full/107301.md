lamarckianism:/ləˈmɑːrkiənɪzəm/| n. | 拉马克主义 |The theory of evolution proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics.  This means that organisms can pass on traits acquired during their lifetime to their offspring.| Lamarckianism, while largely discredited, was an important step in the development of evolutionary theory. 拉马克主义虽然很大程度上已被否定，但在进化论的发展中是一个重要的步骤。|近义词: Lamarckism,  inheritance of acquired characteristics|反义词: Darwinism, neo-Darwinism|词性:noun

Etymology: Named after French biologist Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829).
