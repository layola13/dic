词源:  "Clam" comes from Old English "clam" or "clom," referring to something that grips or fastens.  This likely relates to how clams close their shells tightly. "Clammers" is simply the plural form of "clammer," referring to a person who digs for clams, formed by adding the suffix "-er" (denoting an agent or someone who performs an action).
