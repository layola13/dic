exaspidean:/ɛksæˈspɪdiən/
adjective
外盾状的；属于外盾类的
Relating to or characteristic of the Exaspida, an extinct order of arthropods.  These creatures possessed an exoskeleton that formed a large, shield-like carapace.
The exaspidean fossil was remarkably well-preserved.  这块外盾类化石保存得非常好。
近义词:  (Difficult to provide precise synonyms due to the specialized nature of the term.  Perhaps "shield-bearing" in a general sense)
反义词: (No direct antonym exists)
词性: adjective


Etymology:  From "Exaspida" (the taxonomic order) + "-ean" (a suffix forming adjectives from nouns).  "Exaspida" itself is derived from Greek *exaspis* (meaning "outer shield").
