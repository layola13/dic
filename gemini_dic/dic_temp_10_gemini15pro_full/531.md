词源:
From Latin abominari "deprecate as an omen, shudder at, detest," from ab- "away from" (see ab-) + ominari "foretell, prophesy," from omen (genitive ominis) "foreboding, portent" (see omen).  Originally "to turn away from as from something unlucky," hence "to deprecate, detest." Related: Abominated; abominating.
来自拉丁语 abominari “作为预兆而反对， shudder at, detest,” 来自 ab- “远离” (参见 ab-) + ominari “预言，预言，” 来自 omen (所有格 ominis) “预感，预兆” (参见 omen)。 最初是“避开不吉利的东西”，因此是“反对，憎恶”。 相关：Abominated；abominating。
