lherzolite: /ˈlɜːrzəˌlaɪt/ | n. | 勒尔佐石（一种橄榄岩） | A type of ultramafic igneous rock, a peridotite, composed primarily of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. It is believed to be a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle. |  The geologists discovered a large deposit of lherzolite. 地质学家发现了一大片勒尔佐石矿床。|  The lherzolite sample contained a high percentage of olivine.  这块勒尔佐石样本中含有高比例的橄榄石。| synonym: peridotite (more general), dunite (if primarily olivine), harzburgite (if orthopyroxene dominant) | antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific rock type.  Could consider contrasting rock types like granite or basalt.) | noun
