aerofoil:/ˈɛərəfɔɪl/ (UK) /ˈɛroʊfɔɪl/ (US)| n. |机翼，翼型|A part or surface, such as a wing, propeller blade, or rudder, whose shape and orientation control stability, direction, lift, thrust, or propulsion.  A streamlined shape designed to produce lift as it moves through the air.|The plane's aerofoil enabled it to generate sufficient lift for takeoff.  这架飞机的机翼使其能够产生足够的升力以起飞。|Synonym: wing, airfoil (US spelling), hydrofoil (when in water)|Antonym: N/A|Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From aero- (relating to air) + -foil (leaf-shaped blade).  "Aero-" comes from Greek "aer" (air). "-foil" comes from Old French "foille" (leaf), ultimately from Latin "folium" (leaf).

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The aerofoil generates lift. = 机翼产生升力。
The shape of the aerofoil is crucial for flight. = 机翼的形状对于飞行至关重要。

一般过去时:
The Wright brothers designed a new aerofoil for their first airplane. = 莱特兄弟为他们的第一架飞机设计了一种新的机翼。
The damaged aerofoil caused the plane to crash. =  损坏的机翼导致飞机坠毁。

现在完成时:
Engineers have developed more efficient aerofoils. = 工程师们已经开发出更高效的机翼。
The aerofoil has undergone extensive testing in a wind tunnel. = 机翼已经在风洞中进行了广泛的测试。

过去完成时:
The pilot realized the aerofoil had been damaged before takeoff. = 飞行员在起飞前意识到机翼已经受损。
They had studied different aerofoil designs before building the model. = 在建造模型之前，他们研究了不同的机翼设计。

将来时:
New materials will allow for lighter and stronger aerofoils. = 新材料将使机翼更轻、更坚固。
The next generation of aircraft will use advanced aerofoil designs. = 下一代飞机将使用先进的机翼设计。

虚拟语气:
If the aerofoil were larger, it would generate more lift. = 如果机翼更大，它会产生更大的升力。
I wish the aerofoil were more efficient. = 我希望机翼效率更高。

被动语态:
The aerofoil was tested in a wind tunnel. = 机翼在风洞中进行了测试。
The new aerofoil is being developed by a team of engineers. = 新的机翼正在由一个工程师团队开发。


疑问句:
What type of aerofoil is used on this aircraft? = 这架飞机使用什么类型的机翼？
How does the aerofoil generate lift? = 机翼如何产生升力？

否定句:
The aerofoil does not generate enough lift. = 机翼产生的升力不足。
The design of the aerofoil is not optimal. = 机翼的设计不是最佳的。


PHRASE->
aerofoil section = 翼型截面
aerofoil design = 机翼设计
aerofoil shape = 机翼形状
aerofoil theory = 机翼理论
aerofoil characteristics = 机翼特性
