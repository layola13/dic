PHRASE->
There is no commonly used phrase with the proper noun "Boyce."  Since it is primarily used as a name, it doesn't typically form part of established phrases.  Phrases are more common with common nouns or verbs.  "Boyce" functions primarily as a name and therefore doesn't have common phrase pairings.  For example, you wouldn't say "What's up, Boyce?" in the same way you would say "What's up, doc?" as the latter is a common, playful phrase.  Similarly, "Boyce about" doesn't have the same meaning or usage as "what about."


注意事项:  As noted above, given names don't typically have antonyms.  Also, while synonyms can be provided for the given name, they don't represent the same individual.
