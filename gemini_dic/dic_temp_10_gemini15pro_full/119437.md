microlestes:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈlɛstiːz/ | n. |微型盗龙|A genus of extinct, small, carnivorous dinosaurs.  They were characterized by their small size and sharp teeth, likely preying on insects and other small animals. |Example: Microlestes fossils have been found in Late Triassic and Early Jurassic deposits. 微型盗龙化石发现于晚三叠世和早侏罗世沉积物中。| Example:  Microlestes is one of the earliest known dinosaurs. 微型盗龙是已知最早的恐龙之一。 | 近义词: (Due to its specific nature, a true synonym is difficult.  Perhaps "small theropod" could be considered a broader category) 小型兽脚亚目恐龙 | 反义词: (No direct antonym for a specific genus.  Perhaps "large dinosaur" in a comparative context) 大型恐龙| 词性: noun
