dentry:/ˈdɛntri/| n.|目录项|A directory entry; a structure in the Linux kernel that represents a file or directory within a filesystem.  It associates a name (filename) with an inode (which holds the file's metadata).|The dentry cache speeds up file access by storing recently accessed dentries.|近义词:directory entry|反义词:N/A|词性:noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The dentry stores information about a file. = 目录项存储有关文件的信息。
The kernel uses dentries to access files efficiently. = 内核使用目录项来有效地访问文件。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The system is creating a new dentry for the file. = 系统正在为该文件创建一个新的目录项。
The kernel is caching the dentry for faster access. = 内核正在缓存目录项以加快访问速度。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The system has created a dentry for the file. = 系统已经为该文件创建了一个目录项。
The kernel has cached the dentry. = 内核已经缓存了目录项。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The system has been using this dentry for a while. = 系统已经使用此目录项一段时间了。
The kernel has been caching dentries to improve performance. = 内核一直在缓存目录项以提高性能。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The system created a dentry when the file was opened. = 当文件打开时，系统创建了一个目录项。
The kernel cached the dentry for later use. = 内核缓存了目录项以供以后使用。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was creating a dentry when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，系统正在创建目录项。
The kernel was caching the dentry while the file was being accessed. = 在访问文件时，内核正在缓存目录项。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The system had already created a dentry before the file was accessed. = 在访问文件之前，系统已经创建了一个目录项。
The kernel had cached the dentry before the application requested it. = 在应用程序请求之前，内核已经缓存了目录项。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been using that dentry for several minutes before the crash. = 在崩溃之前，系统已经使用该目录项几分钟了。
The kernel had been caching dentries all day to improve system responsiveness. = 内核整天都在缓存目录项以提高系统响应速度。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The system will create a dentry when the file is opened. = 当文件打开时，系统将创建一个目录项。
The kernel will cache the dentry for future access. = 内核将缓存目录项以供将来访问。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be creating a new dentry for the file. = 系统将为该文件创建一个新的目录项。
The kernel will be caching the dentry for faster access. = 内核将缓存目录项以加快访问速度。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The system will have created a dentry by the time the application requests it. = 在应用程序请求之前，系统将已经创建了一个目录项。
The kernel will have cached the dentry before the file is accessed. = 在访问文件之前，内核将已经缓存了目录项。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The system will have been using that dentry for a few seconds by the time the operation completes. = 在操作完成时，系统将已经使用该目录项几秒钟了。
The kernel will have been caching dentries for hours to optimize file access. = 内核将已经缓存目录项几个小时以优化文件访问。

PHRASE->
negative dentry = 否定目录项
dentry cache = 目录项缓存
dentry lookup = 目录项查找
dentry operations = 目录项操作
dentry tree = 目录项树
