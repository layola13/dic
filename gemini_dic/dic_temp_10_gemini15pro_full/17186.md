baud:/bɔːd/
n.|波特|A unit of signaling speed equal to the number of discrete signal events per second. One baud equals one bit per second in a train of binary signals and one 3-bit byte per second in a train of signals each of which can assume one of eight different states.|The modem operated at 14,400 baud.|近义词: bit rate, signal rate|反义词: (No direct antonym)|词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Émile Baudot (1845–1903), French telegraph engineer.

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The connection had been established at 14,400 baud before it dropped. = 在连接断开之前，它已经以14,400波特的速率建立。
They had configured the system for a higher baud rate, but it didn't work. = 他们已经将系统配置为更高的波特率，但它不起作用。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The modem had been operating at a low baud rate for several days before we noticed the problem. = 在我们注意到问题之前，调制解调器已经以低波特率运行了好几天。
They had been experimenting with different baud rates for weeks. = 他们已经尝试了不同的波特率好几个星期。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The new modem will support a baud rate of up to 57,600. = 新的调制解调器将支持高达57,600的波特率。
We will test the connection at different baud rates tomorrow. = 我们明天将以不同的波特率测试连接。
