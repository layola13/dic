lieve:/liːv/
word property: suffix
中文翻译:相信，亲爱的
英文解析:A suffix meaning "believe," "dear," or "beloved."  It primarily appears as a component in other words, and doesn't stand alone as a word in modern English.
例句:This suffix appears in words like "believe" (to accept as true) and in some archaic words related to love or affection. Since "lieve" itself isn't a word, a direct example sentence isn't applicable.
近义词: N/A (as a standalone word)
