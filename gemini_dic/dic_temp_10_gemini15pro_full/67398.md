现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Not applicable. `extern` is a compile-time declaration and doesn't relate to ongoing actions.

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Not applicable.  `extern` is a compile-time declaration and doesn't relate to completed actions.


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Not applicable. `extern` is a compile-time declaration and doesn't relate to durations of actions.

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Not applicable. `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Not applicable.  `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Not applicable. `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Not applicable. `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Not applicable.  `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Not applicable.  `extern`'s declaration isn't time-dependent.

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):

虚拟语气:
Not applicable.  `extern` is a declarative keyword, not used in conditional sentences.

被动语态:
Not applicable.  `extern` itself can't be acted upon.

PHRASE->

(While `extern` doesn't typically form phrases in the same way as other words,  it's frequently used *in conjunction with* specific syntax elements.)

`extern "C"`:  Used to declare functions with C linkage in C++.  // 在 C++ 中用于声明具有 C 链接的函数。
`extern const int value;`: Declares a constant integer defined elsewhere. // 声明一个在其他地方定义的常量整数。
`extern char* message;`: Declares a character pointer (string) defined externally. // 声明一个外部定义的字符指针（字符串）。
`extern void my_function();`: Declares a function prototype, indicating the function is defined in another module.  // 声明一个函数原型，表明该函数在另一个模块中定义。
`extern struct MyStruct data;`: Declares a structure variable defined externally. // 声明一个外部定义的结构体变量。


注意事项:

The most common use of `extern` is with variables and functions in C and C++ for linking multiple source files.  It’s a crucial element for modular programming.  The tense-based examples are not applicable since `extern` is a compile-time directive related to the structure of the code, not the runtime execution flow.
