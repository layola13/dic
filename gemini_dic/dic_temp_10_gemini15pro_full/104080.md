注意事项:

*  "Jump's" is not a frequently used form. It's often more natural to use "of the jump" instead.  For example, "the height of the jump" is generally preferred over "the jump's height."
* The examples provided are for illustrative purposes. The context determines whether using the possessive 's with "jump" is appropriate and natural-sounding.  It's generally more common with specific, identifiable jumps rather than the general concept of jumping.
