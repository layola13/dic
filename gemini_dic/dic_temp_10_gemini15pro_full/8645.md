PHRASE->
angular anticonformity = 角度不整合
studying the anticonformity = 研究不整合面
formation of an anticonformity = 不整合面的形成
identifying an anticonformity = 识别不整合面
the anticonformity represents = 不整合面代表


词源:  "anti-" (against) + "conformity" (agreement with prevailing practices or norms).  The geological term refers to a break in the rock record where younger rocks lie on top of older, eroded rocks, a situation that "goes against" the expected continuous layering.  The social meaning developed by analogy, referring to behavior that goes against social norms.
