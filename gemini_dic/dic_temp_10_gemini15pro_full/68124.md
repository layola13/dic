注意事项:
*  The primary meaning of "faggot" as a bundle of sticks is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  
*  Its prevalent usage is as a deeply offensive slur against gay men.  **It should be avoided at all costs.**  Using this word perpetuates harm and discrimination.  Always opt for respectful and inclusive language.
