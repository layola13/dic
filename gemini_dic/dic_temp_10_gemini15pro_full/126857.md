词源: "napless" comes from "nap" (referring to the fuzzy surface of a fabric) + "-less" (a suffix indicating absence). "Naplessness" is formed by adding "-ness" (a suffix creating a noun denoting a state or quality).  "Naplessnesses" is the plural form, suggesting multiple instances or types of naplessness.
