PHRASE->

(Muchnesses is not typically used in phrases.  It stands alone as a noun.  Therefore, I'm providing examples of how the word "much" can be used in phrases, which is closer to the spirit of this request than trying to force phrases with "muchnesses" which sound unnatural.)


too much 太多
so much 这么多
much appreciated 非常感激
much obliged 非常感谢

词源： "Muchness" is derived from the adjective "much" with the suffix "-ness" added to form a noun indicating a state or quality of being much.  The suffix "-ness" is a common way to form nouns from adjectives in English (e.g., happiness, sadness, kindness). While "much" itself has a complex etymology rooted in Old English and Germanic languages, the noun form "muchness" is a more recent development, likely emerging in the 19th century. It's not as commonly used as the adjective "much."
