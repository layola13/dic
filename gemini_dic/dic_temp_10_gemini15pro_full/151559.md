ETYMOLOGY->
"Part" comes from the Old French "part" (feminine) and the Latin "pars" (genitive "partis"), meaning "a portion or share." "From" comes from the Old English "fram," meaning "away from," "out of," or "off."  The combination "part from" thus literally means "to take a portion away from" something or someone.
