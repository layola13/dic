PHRASE-> (Not applicable for slurs.  Phrases using this word would only further promote its use and are therefore not provided.)

词源:  From Yiddish קיִקע (kike), of uncertain origin.  Possibly related to Polish kik, a derogatory term for "rooster" or "fop," referring to the way some Hasidic Jews dress.  Another theory links it to the practice of some Jewish immigrants signing with a circle (instead of an "X") on immigration documents, leading to the association with "kikel" (Yiddish for "circle").


注意事项:  This word is extremely offensive and should never be used under any circumstances. Using it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a culture of anti-Semitism.  There are no acceptable contexts for its use.
