词源:  From Middle English enquerie, from Old French enquerre (“to inquire”), from Latin inquirere, present active infinitive of inquīrō (“I seek, examine, investigate”), from in- (“in, into, on, upon, towards, against”) + quaerō (“I seek, ask”).

用法说明:

"Enquiry's" is the possessive form of "enquiry" (inquiry in American English), indicating ownership or association.  It's used less frequently than the singular possessive "enquiry's" because plural enquiries needing a possessive are less common. It's essential to ensure the plural is genuinely needed before using this form.  Often, the singular "enquiry's" is sufficient. For example, "the enquiry's results" is generally preferred over "the enquiries' results," unless referring to multiple, distinct enquiries, each with its own set of results.
