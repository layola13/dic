The word "fatla" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism, or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a proper analysis.  If you meant something else, please provide the correct spelling.


However, since the prompt requested examples of "what" usage, I'll provide that information below:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: N/A (interrogative words typically don't have antonyms) |  pronoun, determiner, adverb
