nonheritability:/ˌnɒnˌhɛrɪtəˈbɪləti/
n.|非遗传性，不可遗传性|The nonheritability of acquired characteristics is a cornerstone of modern biology. |The study demonstrated the nonheritability of the condition.|synonyms: non-inheritance, acquired characteristic|antonyms: heritability, inheritability|noun

Etymology:
non- (prefix meaning "not") + heritability (from heritable, from inherit, from Old French enheriter, from Latin inhereditare "to appoint as heir," from in- "in" + heres "heir")
