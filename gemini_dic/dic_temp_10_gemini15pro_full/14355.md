autophagy: /ɔːˈtɒfədʒi/ (British) /ɑːˈtɑːfədʒi/ (American)| n. | 自噬 |The natural cellular process of recycling and breaking down damaged or unnecessary components within a cell. This process helps to maintain cellular health and provides energy during periods of stress or starvation. | Autophagy plays a crucial role in preventing the accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain. 自噬在防止大脑中有毒蛋白质积累方面起着至关重要的作用。| synonyms: self-digestion, self-cannibalism | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but processes that promote cellular growth and building, like anabolism, could be considered conceptually opposite) | noun
