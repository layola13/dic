ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *aloiier, from a- "to" + loi "law, standard" (from Latin legem, accusative of lex "law"). Originally referred to the legal standard of fineness for gold or silver. The sense of "mixing metals" arose from the practice of mixing base metals with gold or silver to meet these standards.
