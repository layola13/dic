词源：From Old English *fūlian "to rot, decay, become putrid," from Proto-Germanic *fūlaz "rotten" (source also of Old Norse fūla "to make foul, stink," Middle Dutch vuylen "to make dirty," German faul "rotten, lazy"). The meaning "to make dirty" is from late Old English. The sporting sense "to commit a foul against" is from 1889.
