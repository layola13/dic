词源：
The origin of "catty-corner" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's a corruption of the French phrase "quatre coins" meaning "four corners." Another possibility is that it derives from the dialectal English word "cater," meaning "diagonal." The "kitty-corner" variant is likely a playful alteration.
