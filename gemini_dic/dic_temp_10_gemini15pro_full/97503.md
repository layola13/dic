The word "inghalla" does not appear to be a recognized word in English or any other common language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a definition, etymology, or usage examples.  It is possible that this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun, a dialectal word, or simply a made-up word.


If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, knowing the source (a book, a conversation, a song, etc.) or the language it might belong to could be helpful.
