ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *παν- (pan-, “all”) + τέχνη (téchnē, “art”) + -ικος (-ikos, adjectival suffix) + -ον (-on, neuter singular suffix), literally, "pertaining to all arts," originally referring to a display of industrial arts.  Later, it came to refer to the large vehicle used to transport such displays, and eventually to any large moving van.
