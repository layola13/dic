nonperpendiculars:/ˌnɑːnpɜːrpɛnˈdɪkjələrz/
|n.|非垂直线；不垂直的线|Lines or planes that are not at right angles to each other.|The two nonperpendiculars intersected at an acute angle.|近义词: oblique lines, non-orthogonal lines|反义词: perpendiculars, orthogonal lines|词性:名词

Etymology:
"non-" (prefix): Latin, meaning "not"
