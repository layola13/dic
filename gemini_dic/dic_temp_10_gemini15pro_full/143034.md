词源:  "Outblessing" is a relatively recent word formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) with the word "blessing."  While "blessing" has a long history deriving from Old English "blǣdsian" and ultimately Proto-Germanic roots, the specific term "outblessing" doesn't have a documented etymology beyond this straightforward combination.
