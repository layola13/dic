注意事项:

The word "Cahenslyism" itself seems to be a misnomer or a very obscure term. It refers to a late 19th and early 20th-century movement within the Catholic Church related to immigrant rights and language preservation, particularly among German-speaking Catholics in the United States.  It has no connection to Keynesian economics.  It seems the prompt intended to ask about "Keynesianism."  This response is based on the intended meaning (Keynesian economics) rather than the literal word provided.
