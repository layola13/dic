heteroblastic:/ˌhetərəˈblæstɪk/ | adj. | 异型发育的，异塑的 |  Exhibiting different forms or structures at different stages of development, especially in leaves.  Refers to plants that produce distinctly different juvenile and adult leaves. | The Eucalyptus tree displays heteroblastic development, with its juvenile leaves being round and its adult leaves being sickle-shaped. 桉树表现出异型发育，其幼叶呈圆形，而成年叶呈镰刀形。| The heteroblastic nature of the ivy plant is evident in the change of leaf shape as it matures. 常春藤的异型发育特性在其成熟过程中叶形的变化中显而易见。| 近义词: polymorphic, heteromorphic | 反义词: homoblastic, isomorphic | 词性: adjective

Etymology: From hetero- (different) + -blastic (relating to development or growth), ultimately from Greek *heteros* (different) + *blastos* (bud, sprout).
