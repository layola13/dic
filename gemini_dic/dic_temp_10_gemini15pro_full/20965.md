ETYMOLOGY->
From blemish + -less.  "blemish" (n.)  mid-14c., "a mark of disgrace, moral defect," from Old French blemissement "pale, wan," also "blemish, defect," noun of action from blemir "to make pale, grow pale," from a Germanic source (compare Old High German blemida "pallor"), from PIE root *bhel- (1) "to shine, flash, burn" (source also of Old English blac "pale, wan, livid"). The sense development in French is perhaps via the notion of "blanching, making pale."  The meaning "physical defect, spot, stain" is first recorded late 15c.  "-less" Old English -leas "free from, without," from Proto-Germanic *-lausaz (source also of Old Frisian -les, Dutch -loos, German -los), from PIE root *leus- "to loosen, divide, separate."  Originally added to nouns to form adjectives, later also to verbs.
