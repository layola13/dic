ETYMOLOGY->
From French *adresse* "skill, dexterity," from *adroit* "skillful," from Late Latin *ad directum* "(to the right thing)," from *ad* "to" + *directum* "straight," past participle of *dirigere* "to direct," from *dis-* "apart" + *regere* "to guide, rule."  The meaning shifted from "right, proper" to "skillful" in French. The suffix "-ness" creates a noun of state or quality.
