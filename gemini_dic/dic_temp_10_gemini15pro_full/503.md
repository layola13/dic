ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *abiden*, from Old English *ābīdan* (“to await, wait for, expect, endure, experience, abide”), from *ā-* (intensifying prefix) + *bīdan* (“to bide, wait, remain, continue, dwell, inhabit”).  Cognate with Dutch *abijden* (“to await”), German *abwarten* (“to wait out”), *erwarten* (“to expect”). The present participle *abiding* is more common.
