词源：From Latin *lien, from Proto-Italic *liēn-. Cognate with Ancient Greek λίαν (líān, “very much, exceedingly”), Sanskrit रीयते (rīyate, “melts away, flows”) and perhaps also with Albanian lëng (“liquid”).  The connection of meanings is not entirely clear, but may relate to the organ's dark red color, as if congested with blood.
