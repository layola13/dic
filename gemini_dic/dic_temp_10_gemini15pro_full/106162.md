ETYMOLOGY->

From "knock about," meaning to wander or roam, and later to treat roughly or handle carelessly.  The sense of a boisterous or slapstick comedy developed from the idea of rough-and-tumble action on stage.  Ultimately derived from "knock" and "about." 源于“knock about”，意思是游荡或漫游，后来引申为粗暴对待或随意处理。闹剧或滑稽喜剧的含义是从舞台上粗暴的动作发展而来的。最终源自“knock”和“about”。
