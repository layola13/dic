词源: From Middle English *glom, from Old Norse glám, from Proto-Germanic *glōmaz (“twilight”). Cognate with Danish glem (“forget”), Swedish glömma (“forget”), Icelandic gleyma (“forget”). Related to gleam.  The ending -'s is a possessive marker, indicating "belonging to gloom."


注意事项:  “Gloom's” itself is not commonly used. It’s more common to use “gloom” followed by a preposition like "of"  (e.g., the gloom of the forest). However, the possessive form can be used poetically or for emphasis.
