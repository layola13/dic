ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *accusatif, from Old French accusatif, from Latin accūsātīvus, from accūsātus (past participle of accūsō (“I accuse”)), from ad (“to, towards”) + causa (“cause, reason”).

USAGE->
The accusative case is primarily used to mark the direct object of a verb.

Example 1: The cat ate the mouse. (Mouse is the direct object and thus in the accusative case.)
猫吃了老鼠。（Mouse是直接宾语，因此是宾格）

Example 2:  I saw her at the store. (Her is the direct object and thus in the accusative case.)
我在商店看到了她。（Her是直接宾语，因此是宾格）


It can also be used after certain prepositions.  Which prepositions take the accusative varies by language. In English, this is less relevant as pronouns are the primary words that inflect for case.

Example 1:  He walked toward me. (Me is the object of the preposition toward and in the accusative case.)
他朝我走来。（Me是介词toward的宾语，是宾格）

Example 2:  The gift is for them. (Them is the object of the preposition for and in the accusative case.)
这份礼物是给他们的。（Them是介词for的宾语，是宾格）


In some languages, the accusative case can also be used to mark the object of certain verbs or to indicate duration or extent.  This is not generally applicable to English.



PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in common phrases in English.  It is a grammatical term.  Phrases are built around the words that are *in* the accusative case, such as pronouns like *me*, *him*, *her*, *us*, and *them*.
