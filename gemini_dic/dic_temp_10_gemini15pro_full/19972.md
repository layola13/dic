biofeedbacks:/ˌbaɪoʊˈfiːdbæks/ |n.| 生物反馈 |The use of electronic monitoring of a normally automatic bodily function (such as heartbeat or muscle tension) in order to train someone to acquire voluntary control of that function.

This feedback can be in the form of visual or auditory cues, allowing the individual to become more aware of their body's responses and learn to control them.|She uses biofeedbacks to manage her migraines. 她使用生物反馈来控制偏头痛。|Near Synonyms: biofeedback, neurofeedback| Antonyms: None (It's a therapeutic technique, not a quality with an opposite)| Noun
