blastogenesis:/ˌblæstəˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/
n.
芽基发育；胚层形成
The formation of germ layers in an embryo.  The reproduction of an organism by budding.
Blastogenesis is the process by which the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) are formed in the embryo.
Blastogenesis also refers to asexual reproduction by budding.
例句：Blastogenesis is a crucial stage in embryonic development. 胚层形成是胚胎发育的关键阶段。

Blastogenesis allows organisms like hydra to reproduce asexually. 芽基发育使得像水螅这样的生物体能够进行无性繁殖。

近义词：germ layer formation, budding
反义词:  (No direct antonym, potentially gametogenesis as it refers to sexual reproduction)
词性: noun
