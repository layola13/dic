ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *congenialis* "of the same nature, kindred," from *com-* "with, together" (see com-) + *genialis* "festive, of or belonging to one's genius or guardian deity," from *genius* "guardian deity, spirit" (see genius).  The sense evolution seems to have passed from "sharing the same genius" to "suited to one's nature" to "pleasant."
