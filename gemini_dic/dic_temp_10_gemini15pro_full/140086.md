The word "ofenis" does not appear to be a valid English word.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a word from another language.  If you can provide more context or correct the spelling, I can offer a proper analysis.

If you meant "offense" or "offence" (both spellings are correct), here's the analysis:

offense/offence: /əˈfɛns/ (US) /əˈfɛns/ (UK)| n. | 冒犯; 进攻; 犯罪; 违法 | An act that breaks a law or rule, or causes anger, upset, or hurt feelings. |  例句：His words were a serious offense to her. 他的话对她严重冒犯。

例句：The team's offense was unstoppable.  该队的进攻势不可挡。| 近义词：crime, insult, attack, transgression | 反义词：defense, compliment, praise | 词性: noun
