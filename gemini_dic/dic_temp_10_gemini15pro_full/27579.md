ETYMOLOGY->
From French *canard* "duck," from Old French *quanart*, of uncertain origin. The connection to "false story" comes from the French expression *vendre un canard à moitié* "to half-sell a duck," meaning "to swindle," which later evolved to mean "to spread a hoax."  The story goes that a journalist fabricated a story about a duck that ate a certain number of other ducks, demonstrating its voracity. This story, although false, spread widely, leading to the association of *canard* with a fabricated story.
