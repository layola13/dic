ETYMOLOGY->
From "coast" + "-er", signifying an agent noun.  "Coast" itself originates from Old French "coste" (rib, side, coast), ultimately from Latin "costa" (rib, side). The sense of a ship sailing along a coast developed first, followed by the sense of something moving effortlessly (like a ship coasting along the water). The use of "coaster" to refer to a small mat derives from the idea of it protecting the table surface from the "coasting" or sliding movement of a glass.
