The word "ayenward" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a dialectal word, archaic word, or even a newly coined term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.

If you could double-check the spelling or provide more context (where you encountered this word, its intended meaning), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.


However, I can demonstrate the requested format using the word "forward":
