inorganic:/ˌɪnɔːrˈɡænɪk/ | adj. |无机的，非生物的|Not derived from living matter; relating to or denoting compounds that are not organic (i.e. not containing carbon).|例句：Rocks and minerals are inorganic substances. 岩石和矿物是无机物。

|例句：Inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. 无机化学是对无机化合物的性质和反应的研究。|近义词：non-organic, abiotic, lifeless |反义词：organic, biotic, living |词性:形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + organic.  The word "organic" originally referred to substances derived from living organisms.  Therefore, "inorganic" meant not derived from living organisms.
