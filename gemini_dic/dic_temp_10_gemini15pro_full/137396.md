nontensilities:/ˌnɒntɛnˈsɪlɪtiz/ | n. | 非张力性；非紧张性 | The nontensilities of the rope made it difficult to tie a secure knot.  绳子缺乏张力，很难打一个牢固的结。 |  例句：The study explored the nontensilities of different materials under varying pressures.  这项研究探讨了不同材料在不同压力下的非张力性。 | 近义词：laxity, looseness, slackness | 反义词：tension, tensility, tightness | 词性：名词

词源:  From non- + tensility, from tensile + -ity.  "Tensile" comes from Latin "tensilis," meaning "capable of being stretched," from "tendere," meaning "to stretch."
