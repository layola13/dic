Etymology: From Middle English *depely*, from Old English *dēoplīce* ("deeply"), from *dēop* ("deep") + *-līce* (adverbial suffix).  The Old English *dēop* is related to Old High German *tiof*, Old Frisian *diap*, Dutch *diep*, German *tief*, and Gothic *diups*, all from Proto-Germanic *diupaz*. Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dʰewbʰ-* ("deep, hollow").
