ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *acont*, *acumpte* "a reckoning, counting," from Latin *computare* "to count, sum up, reckon," from *com* "with, together" + *putare* "to reckon, think". The spelling with -cc- arose in the 16th century, probably by analogy with words like *accomplish*.  The spelling "account" eventually prevailed.

USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  It is generally replaced by "account".  However, if used, it functions grammatically the same as "account" as a noun.

PHRASE->
(Since "accompt" is archaic, set phrases are rare.  These are examples of how it *could* be used in phrases, based on the usage of "account")
give an accompt of =  解释...
demand an accompt of = 要求...的解释
keep an accompt of = 记录...
settle an accompt = 结清账目
render an accompt = 提交账目

注意事项:
Although technically a noun, "accompt" can function similarly to a verb in phrases like "give an accompt," reflecting its original verbal sense.  It's crucial to remember that this word is outdated and using "account" is preferred in modern English.
