ETYMOLOGY->
"logical" comes from Old French "logique" and ultimately from Greek "logikos" meaning "reasoning, pertaining to speech." "Positivist" is derived from French "positivisme," based on "positif" meaning "placed, laid down, positive," from Latin "positus," past participle of "ponere" meaning "to put, place."
