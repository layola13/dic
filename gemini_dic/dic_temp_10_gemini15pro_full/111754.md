词源:  "loder" comes from the verb "to load," which has roots in the Old English word "lād" meaning "a way, course, journey." Over time, the meaning evolved to include the act of putting goods onto a vehicle for transport.  The suffix "-er" denotes an agent or instrument that performs the action of the verb, resulting in "loader," signifying a person or machine that loads.
