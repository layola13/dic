词源:  "Nongratuitous" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "gratuitous" (meaning "uncalled for" or "without good reason").  "Gratuitous" itself comes from the Latin word "gratuitus," meaning "free" or "given without charge."  Therefore, "nongratuitous" describes something that is *not* free, *not* uncalled for, and *not* without good reason.
