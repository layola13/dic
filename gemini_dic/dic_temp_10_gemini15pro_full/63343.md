entodermal:/ˌɛntəˈdərməl/| adj.|内胚层的|Of or relating to the entoderm (also called endoderm), the innermost of the three primary germ layers of an embryo.|The entodermal cells differentiate into the lining of the digestive tract and its associated structures.|近义词:endodermal|反义词:ectodermal|词性:形容词

Etymology:
From ento- +‎ derm +‎ -al.  Ento- is a variant of endo-, meaning "within," derived from Greek.  Derm comes from Greek derma, meaning "skin" or "layer."
