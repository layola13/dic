The word "mainpernor" appears to be a misspelling or an archaic legal term.  It's likely a variant of "mainprise," which itself is rarely used in modern English.  I'll provide information on "mainprise" as it's the closest valid word.

mainprise: /meɪnˈpraɪz/ | n. |  保释，担保 | A pledge to produce a prisoner in court at a specified time.  Historically, it involved taking responsibility for someone accused of a crime, ensuring their appearance in court. |  "He was released on mainprise." 他被保释释放。 | Synonym: bail, surety | Antonym: imprisonment, detention | noun

注意事项:

The word "mainpernor" is archaic and should be replaced with "surety" or "one who gives mainprise."  "Mainprise" itself is less common than "bail."
