Etymology:
From "converser" + "'s" (possessive suffix).  "Converser" comes from the verb "converse," which originates from Old French "converser" and ultimately from Latin "conversari," meaning "to associate with, keep company with, live with, dwell, abide, stay, pass time."  The Latin is formed from "com-" (together) + "versari" (to turn, be engaged in), from "vertere" (to turn).
