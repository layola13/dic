ETYMOLOGY->
From moon + lit (past participle of light).  The word "moon" comes from Old English "mōna," which is related to Germanic and ultimately Proto-Indo-European roots meaning "to measure" (as the moon measures the months). "Lit" is the past participle of "light," which comes from Old English "līhtan," meaning "to shine, illuminate."
