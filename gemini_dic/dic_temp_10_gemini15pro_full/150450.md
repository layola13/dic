pantastomata:/ˌpæntəˈstɒmətə/ | n. | 舌形虫纲 |A group of parasitic invertebrates, also known as tongue worms, characterized by their elongated, worm-like bodies and their parasitic lifestyle.  They infect the respiratory tracts of vertebrates.| Example: Pantastomata are obligate parasites, meaning they cannot survive without a host. 舌形虫是专性寄生虫，意味着它们没有宿主就无法生存。

Example:  The life cycle of pantastomata is complex and often involves intermediate hosts. 舌形虫的生命周期很复杂，通常涉及中间宿主。| 近义词:Linguatulida | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Noun

pantastomatid:/ˌpæntəˈstɒmətɪd/ | n. adj. | 舌形虫 |A member of the Pantastomata group;  also used as an adjective relating to this group.| Example:  The pantastomid larva was found in the snake's lung. 在蛇的肺里发现了舌形虫幼虫。

Example: Pantastomid infections are rare in humans. 人类感染舌形虫的情况很少见。 | 近义词:tongue worm | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Noun, Adjective
