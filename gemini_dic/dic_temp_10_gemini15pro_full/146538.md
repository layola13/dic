词性: v.


词源:  "over-" (prefix meaning "excessively") + "glamorize" (verb meaning "to make something seem glamorous"). "Glamorize" itself comes from "glamour" (attractiveness, charm) + "-ize" (suffix meaning "to make or cause to be").  Ultimately, "glamour" derives from "grammar,"  as in the Middle Ages, learning (especially of Latin grammar) was associated with magic and enchantment.
