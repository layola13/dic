"cross-" (prefix): From Old English "cros" and Old Norse "kross," ultimately from Latin "crux" (cross).  Meaning "across," "transversely," or "involving interaction or intersection."

"-culturally" (suffix): Derived from "culture" + "-ally" (adverbial suffix).  "Culture" comes from Latin "cultura" (cultivation, care), from "colere" (to cultivate, till).
