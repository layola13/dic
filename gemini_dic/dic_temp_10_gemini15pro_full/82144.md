ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *grōma "man, male human being," related to Dutch *grom, Old High German *gomo, and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *grōmaz, meaning "man."  The sense shifted to "servant who cares for horses" in Middle English. The meaning "bridegroom" developed from the idea of the groom attending to the bride's horse.
