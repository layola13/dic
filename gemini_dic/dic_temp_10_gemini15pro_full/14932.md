PHRASE->
calibrate the azotometer = 校准氮素计
use the azotometer to determine = 使用氮素计测定
read the azotometer = 读取氮素计
record the azotometer reading = 记录氮素计读数
maintain the azotometer = 维护氮素计


词源:  "azoto-" (from French "azote," meaning nitrogen) + "-meter" (a suffix denoting a measuring instrument).  Ultimately derived from Greek "a-" (not) + "zōtikos" (of life), as nitrogen does not support life on its own.
