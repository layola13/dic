ETYMOLOGY->
From mesmerize + -ing.  Mesmerize comes from Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a theory of animal magnetism, which he called "mesmerism."  He believed he could cure illnesses by passing magnets over people's bodies.  His methods were later discredited, but his name gave rise to the word "mesmerize" meaning to hypnotize or fascinate.
