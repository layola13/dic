The word "listel" isn't a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a very specialized term.  Did you perhaps mean "listen," "list," or "libel"?  I'll provide information for "listen" as it's the closest common word:

listen:/ˈlɪsən/ |vi.|听, 倾听|To pay attention to sound; to hear something with thoughtful attention. |例句：Listen to the music.  听音乐。|近义词：hear, heed, attend|反义词:ignore, disregard|Verb


listen:/ˈlɪsən/ |vi.|听从，听信|To heed advice or a warning.|例句：Listen to your mother. 听你妈妈的话。|近义词：obey, comply, heed|反义词:disobey, ignore|Verb
