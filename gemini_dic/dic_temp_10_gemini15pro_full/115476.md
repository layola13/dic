manuli: /ˈmænjuːlaɪ/ | n. (plural) | 手套 (尤指工作手套) |  Likely a variant or misspelling of "manuale," which is a Latin word meaning "handbook" or "manual." In some contexts, "manuli" might be used informally or regionally to refer to gloves, especially work gloves, perhaps drawing a connection to the idea of protecting the hands for manual labor.  However, it is not a standard English word.  If you encountered this word, it's possible it was a typo, a regionalism, or a specialized term within a particular field. | Example: The workers put on their manuli before starting the construction project. (工人们在开始建设项目之前戴上了手套。) |  Near synonyms: gloves, mittens, gauntlets  | Antonyms: bare hands | noun
