词源: From Old English *fǣgen "glad, joyful," from Proto-Germanic *faiganą "to be glad," from PIE root *dhegwh- "to reach, take." Related to Old Frisian fein "joyful," Old Saxon fagan, Old High German fegan "to adorn," Gothic faginon "to rejoice."  The adverbial sense "gladly, willingly" developed from the adjectival use, and the sense "of necessity" arose from the idea of being glad to do something to avoid something worse.
