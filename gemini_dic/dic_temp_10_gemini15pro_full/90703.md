ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *humectātiōn-, from Latin humectāre (to moisten) + -iōn- (suffix forming nouns of action).  The Latin humectāre is derived from humectus (moist) + -āre (suffix forming verbs).  Humectus is the past participle of humēre (to be moist). Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *seug- (to drip, ooze).
