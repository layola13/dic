词源:  "Miny" is a shortened form of "miniature," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "miniare," meaning "to illuminate" or "to paint in miniature."  The connection arises from the practice of decorating manuscripts with small, detailed illustrations.  The word eventually came to refer to anything small in size.
