ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *mopen*, from Old English *māpian* ("to gape, chatter, be foolish"), from Proto-Germanic *mauþōną* ("to speak indistinctly, mumble").  The sense of "to move about listlessly" developed later, possibly influenced by the image of someone hanging their head like a drooping flower.  The noun meaning "a tool for cleaning floors" emerged in the 15th century.
