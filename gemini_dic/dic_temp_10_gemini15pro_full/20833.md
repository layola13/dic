blastocyst: /ˈblæstəsɪst/ | n. | 胚泡 |  A thin-walled hollow structure in early embryonic development that contains a cluster of cells called the inner cell mass from which the embryo arises. The outer layer of cells gives rise to the placenta and other supporting tissues needed for fetal development within the uterus. | The blastocyst implants in the uterine wall about six days after fertilization.  胚泡在受精后约六天植入子宫壁。|  The blastocyst stage is crucial for successful implantation. 胚泡阶段对于成功植入至关重要。 | synonyms:  blastula (more general term) | antonyms:  zygote, morula (earlier stages) | noun
