"Luming" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a proper noun (a name), a slang term, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if "Luming" is intended as a proper noun, particularly a Chinese name, I can offer some information:

Luming: /luːˈmɪŋ/ (approximation - tones depend on the specific Chinese characters used) | n. | 鲁明 (example - depends on characters) |  A Chinese given name.  It could translate to various meanings depending on the characters used, but often incorporates ideas of brightness, clarity, or prosperity. | Example: Luming is a talented musician. 鲁明是一位才华横溢的音乐家。 | 近义词: N/A (Proper nouns don't typically have synonyms) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Noun (Proper Noun)


If "luming" is meant to be a different word or has a specific intended meaning, please provide more context.  I can then attempt a more accurate analysis.


Since I cannot analyze "luming" as a standard word, I will provide the requested grammatical examples using the word "what":

/wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. int. | 什么, 多么 | Used to ask for information about something; used to express surprise or disbelief.
