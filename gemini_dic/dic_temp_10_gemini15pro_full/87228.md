注意事项:

"Heres" is a contraction and should generally be avoided in formal writing.  While it can replace "here are," using "here is" with a plural noun is grammatically incorrect.  Its etymology comes from the contraction of "here" and "is" or "are." While commonly used, it's essential to understand its informal nature and grammatical limitations.
