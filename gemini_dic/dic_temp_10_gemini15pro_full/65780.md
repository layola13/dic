everythings:/ˈevriθɪŋz/ | Incorrect Form |  This is not a standard English word. | "Everythings" is a non-standard pluralization of "everything." "Everything" already encompasses all things and doesn't require a plural form. | This word is not used in standard English and therefore has no valid example sentences. |  Near synonyms might be "all things," "everything," or "the whole lot." | N/A (Since it's incorrect, it has no antonyms) | Pronoun (when used correctly as "everything")
