"koulan" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, what language it might be from), I can try to offer more assistance.

Since I can't provide information on "koulan," I'll use the word "oxen" (which was in your example) as a demonstration of the requested format.
