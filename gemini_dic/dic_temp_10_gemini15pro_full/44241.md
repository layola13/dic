croconate: /ˈkroʊkəneɪt/ | n. | 鳄酸盐 | A salt or ester of croconic acid.  Croconic acid is a cyclic organic acid with the formula C5H2O5. | Potassium croconate is a yellow crystalline solid. 鳄酸钾是一种黄色结晶固体。| The croconate anion can form complexes with metal ions. 鳄酸根阴离子可以与金属离子形成络合物。 |  oxalate, carboxylate | - | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From croconic acid + -ate (suffix forming nouns denoting salts or esters).  Croconic acid derives its name from the Greek word "krokos," meaning saffron, because of the yellow color of its potassium salt.
