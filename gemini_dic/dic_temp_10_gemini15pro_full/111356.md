Etymology: From "liveness" + "-es" (plural suffix). "Liveness" comes from "live" (adjective) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality).  The word "live" traces back to Old English "libban," related to Old High German "lebēn" and Gothic "liban," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*libjaną."
