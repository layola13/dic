PHRASE->

(Since "dwey" is a descriptive adjective, it doesn't typically form set phrases.  It's primarily used to describe things that are moist or covered with dew.  Therefore, instead of phrases, here are some common collocates - words that frequently appear with "dwey"):


dwey grass  湿漉漉的草地
dwey leaves  湿漉漉的树叶
dwey flowers 湿漉漉的花朵
dwey morning 湿漉漉的早晨
dwey air 潮湿的空气


注意事项:

While "dwey" is a legitimate word, it's somewhat archaic and less commonly used than "dewy."  "Dewy" is the preferred and more modern spelling.
