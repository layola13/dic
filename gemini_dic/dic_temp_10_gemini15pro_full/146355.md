overfit: /ˌoʊvərˈfɪt/ | v. n. | 过拟合 | To train a machine learning model to such an extent that it performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.  It essentially memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns. | The model overfit the training data and performed poorly on the test set.  该模型过拟合了训练数据，在测试集上表现很差。 | overtrain, memorize | underfit | verb, noun

overfit: /ˌoʊvərˈfɪt/ | v. n. | 过拟合 |  The act of overfitting a model.  A model that has been overfit.  | The overfit was evident in the high training accuracy and low test accuracy. 过拟合体现在高训练精度和低测试精度上。 | overtraining, memorization | underfitting | verb, noun
