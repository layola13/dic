词源： "Gang" comes from Old Norse "gangr" meaning "a going, a course, a company of men."  "Bang" in this context refers to violent sexual intercourse and is likely related to words denoting a forceful impact.


注意事项: This word is extremely offensive and should be avoided.  Use "rape" or "sexual assault" instead.  Always prioritize the well-being and respect of victims.
