词源: From electrify + -ed.  "Electrify" comes from "electric" + "-fy". "Electric" ultimately derives from the Greek word "ēlektron" meaning "amber," as amber was one of the first substances observed to exhibit static electricity. "-fy" is a suffix meaning "to make," derived from the French "-fier" and ultimately from the Latin "-ficare."
