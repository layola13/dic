morulation: /ˌmɔːrjuˈleɪʃən/ (This word is not a standard English word and likely a misspelling or a very specialized technical term.  It is possibly intended to be "modulation" or a related term.) | n. (likely) | 调制;调节 (Assuming intended word is "modulation") |  The process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted. |  *The morulation of the signal allowed for clear communication.* (Example assuming intended meaning) *The precise morulation of the laser is crucial for the experiment.* (Example assuming intended meaning) | 近义词: modulation, regulation, adjustment (If "modulation" was intended) | 反义词:  (Dependent on the intended meaning.  If "modulation" was intended, possible antonyms could be:  constancy, stability) | 词性: noun (likely)

PHRASE-> (These are difficult to provide without a confirmed, standard English word.  These examples assume "modulation" was intended and offer phrases related to that concept.)

*frequency modulation* 频率调制
*amplitude modulation* 幅度调制
*phase modulation* 相位调制
*modulation techniques* 调制技术
*modulation index* 调制指数


注意事项: Since "morulation" is likely not a valid English word, the provided analysis is based on the assumption that "modulation" was intended.  If a different word was intended,  the entire analysis would need to be revised.  Please double-check the spelling and context of the original word.
