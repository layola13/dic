注意事项:
"Looses" is less common than "loses". Be careful not to confuse the two.  While "loose" can mean "to release," it's archaic and less common than "lose."  "Loose" is more commonly used as an adjective meaning "not tight."  Therefore, outside of specific contexts like archery or sailing, "loses" is usually the correct form to use.
