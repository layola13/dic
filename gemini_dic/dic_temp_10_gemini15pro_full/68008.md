词源:
From fact + -oid, influenced by anecdotal. Coined by Norman Mailer in 1973.  Initially meant a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not necessarily true.  Over time, the meaning has shifted, and it is now often used simply to mean a trivial piece of information.
