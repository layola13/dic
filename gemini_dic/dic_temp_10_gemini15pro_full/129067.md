nitrogelatin:/ˌnaɪtroʊˈdʒɛlətɪn/| n. |硝化甘油炸胶，硝化明胶|A high explosive made by dissolving nitrocellulose in nitroglycerin.|Nitrogelatin is a powerful explosive used in mining and demolition. 硝化甘油炸胶是一种用于采矿和爆破的强力炸药。|近义词：gelatin dynamite, blasting gelatin|反义词: N/A|名词

Etymology:

nitro- + gelatin.  "nitro" comes from  Latin *nitrum "natron," from Greek nitron,  and ultimately from Egyptian ntr. "Gelatin" comes from French gélatine, from Italian gelatina, from Late Latin gelata, from Latin gelatus “frozen,” past participle of gelare “to freeze.”
