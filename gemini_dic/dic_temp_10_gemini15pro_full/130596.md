nonadaptations:/ˌnɒnˌædæpˈteɪʃənz/ | n. | 非适应性特征，非适应性 |Traits or characteristics that do not enhance an organism's survival or reproduction in its current environment.  These traits may be neutral or even detrimental. |Many seemingly useless traits in humans, like the appendix, are considered nonadaptations. 许多人类看似无用的特征，例如阑尾，被认为是非适应性特征。| The human tailbone is a nonadaptation, a leftover from our evolutionary ancestors. 人类的尾骨是一种非适应性特征，是我们进化祖先的残留物。 | synonyms: nonadaptive traits, vestigial traits | antonyms: adaptations, adaptive traits | noun
