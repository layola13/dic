Etymology:
"Moistful" is a relatively modern word formed by combining "moist" with the suffix "-ful."  "Moist" comes from Middle English *moyst, from Old French *moiste, ultimately from Latin *musteus, meaning "musty," from mustum "new wine."  The suffix "-ful" is from Old English "-ful," meaning "full of."  While etymologically linked to "musty," "moist" has lost its negative connotations and now refers to a pleasant level of dampness.
