Etymology:
From nymph + -like.  "Nymph" comes from the Late Middle English  *nymf(e)*, from Old French *nimphe*, and ultimately from Latin *nympha*, which itself borrowed from Greek *nýmphē* (νύμφη), meaning "young woman, bride, nymph."  "-like" is a common suffix used to form adjectives indicating resemblance.
