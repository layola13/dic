ETYMOLOGY->

"Overvividness's" is a combination of "over," meaning "excessive," and "vividness," derived from the adjective "vivid," which in turn comes from the Latin word "vivere," meaning "to live."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "vivid" into the noun "vividness," and the possessive apostrophe and "s" indicate possession or belonging to the quality of overvividness.
