ETYMOLOGY->

"cp" as an abbreviation can stand for various things, and its etymology depends on the specific meaning.  When used as a computing command, "cp" is short for "copy," which comes from the Old French word "copie," ultimately deriving from the Latin "copia" meaning "abundance, plenty."  Other meanings, like "content provider" or "cerebral palsy," derive their etymology from the individual words making up the phrase.
