PHRASE->
(Goh doesn't readily form set phrases.  It's typically used as a stand-alone interjection.)
However, it can be used in conjunction with other phrases, for emphasis, for example:
Goh, what a surprise! 哦，真是个惊喜！
Goh, that's too bad. 哦，那太糟糕了。
Goh, I see. 哦，我明白了。
Goh, really? 哦，真的吗？
Goh, is that so? 哦，是这样吗？

注意事项:
"Goh" originates as a variant of "oh" and is primarily used in Singaporean and Malaysian English. It carries a slightly stronger sense of surprise or realization than a simple "oh." It's considered informal.
