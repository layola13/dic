| n.|蹦极跳(复数形式，较少使用)|Multiple instances of the act of jumping from a high place while attached to a long elastic cord.

It's more common to say "He went bungee jumping several times."|He described his various bungee-jumpings around the world.  他描述了他在世界各地进行的各种蹦极跳。 (This sounds a bit unnatural.  It's better to rephrase.)|近义词：bungy jumpings (also less common), multiple bungee jumps|反义词:  (same as above)|noun


Etymology:  "Bungee" comes from the British dialect word "bungy," meaning "thick and squat," referring to the elastic cord. "Jumping" is derived from the Old French word "jumper," meaning "to leap."
