The word "doitkin" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you meant a different word, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help.

If "doitkin" is intended to be a playful variation of "do it, kin," meaning "do it, family" or "do it, relative," then we can analyze the component words:

do:/duː/| v. |做，行动|to perform an action, activity, or task| I do my homework every night. 我每天晚上都做作业。|近义词: perform, execute, act|反义词: neglect, abstain|verb
it:/ɪt/| pron. |它|used to refer to something previously mentioned or easily identified| It is raining outside. 外面在下雨。|近义词: this, that|反义词: (no direct antonym)|pronoun
