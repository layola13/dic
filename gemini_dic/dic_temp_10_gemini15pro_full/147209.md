词源: "Overmanner" is a combination of "over" and "manner". "Over" implies excess, while "manner" refers to a way of acting or behaving.  "Overmanner" thus suggests an excessive or exaggerated display of manners.  "Overmanner" is not a frequently used word in modern English.


注意事项:
"Overmanner" is not a common word and might be perceived as archaic or overly formal.  Consider using synonyms like "affectation," "pretentiousness," or "artificiality" in most contexts.
