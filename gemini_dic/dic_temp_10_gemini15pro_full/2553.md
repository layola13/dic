ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *admittere*  (to send to, let in), from *ad-* (to) + *mittere* (to send).  The suffix *-ible* denotes capability or worthiness, and *-ness* forms a noun indicating a state or quality.  Thus, "admissibleness" refers to the quality of being admissible.


USAGE->
This word is not commonly used because the double possessive ('s) is generally avoided. "Admissibility" is the preferred and more common term. However, if used, it would follow standard noun usage:

The admissibleness's of the evidence will be determined by the judge. = 证据的可接纳性将由法官决定。
The lawyer challenged the admissibleness's of the confession. = 律师对供词的可接纳性提出了质疑。

PHRASE->
Due to its infrequent usage, "admissibleness's" doesn't have common phrases associated with it.  It's more practical to list phrases using "admissible" or "admissibility":

is admissible = 是可接受的
is not admissible = 是不可接受的
the admissibility of = ...的可采纳性
question the admissibility = 质疑可采纳性
rule on the admissibility = 对可采纳性作出裁决
