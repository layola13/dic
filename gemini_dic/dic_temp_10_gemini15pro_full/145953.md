overdispersed:/ˌoʊvər.dɪˈspɜːrst/ | adj. | 过度分散的 | Exhibiting greater variability than expected based on a given statistical model.  It refers to a situation where the variance of a data set is higher than would be predicted by a standard statistical model, such as the Poisson distribution. | The data on the number of accidents per month was overdispersed, suggesting that the Poisson model wasn't appropriate. 每月事故数量的数据过度分散，表明泊松模型不适用。| overscattered, excessively dispersed | underdispersed, homogeneously dispersed | adjective
