后生动物
A major division of the animal kingdom that comprises all animals except protozoa and sponges.  Metazoans are multicellular animals having cells differentiated into tissues and organs and usually a digestive cavity lined with specialized cells.
Sponges and metazoa evolved from separate unicellular ancestors. 海绵和后生动物是从不同的单细胞祖先进化而来的。
