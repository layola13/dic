antipress:/ˈæntiˌprɛs/| adj.|抗压的，耐压的|Resistant to pressure, especially high pressure.|This submarine is built with antipress materials to withstand the crushing depths of the ocean. 这艘潜艇是用抗压材料建造的，可以承受海洋深处的巨大压力。|近义词:pressure-resistant, compression-resistant|反义词:fragile, brittle|词性:形容词


词源:  "anti-" (against) + "press" (pressure).  The prefix "anti-" indicates opposition or resistance, while "press" refers to pressure.  Thus, "antipress" literally means "against pressure".
