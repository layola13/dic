ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *marchier "to walk, tread, trample," and marcher "border, frontier," both from Frankish *marka "frontier, borderland," from Proto-Germanic *marko "border," related to mark (n.). The original sense of the verb was "to walk along a border," hence "to walk in a military manner."
