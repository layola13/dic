注意事项:
* Browne is an older spelling of brown, now considered archaic or a variant spelling, particularly used as a surname. While it can technically be used as an adjective, "brown" is the preferred and standard spelling in modern English.
* Be careful not to confuse the surname "Browne" with the word "brown."
