词源:  "Cope" comes from Old French "couper," meaning "to strike, cut, or bargain." "In" simply adds the sense of inclusion or incorporation. Although "cope-in" isn't a standard dictionary entry like "cope with," it's used in specific contexts, particularly in project management and business, to describe the act of integrating something or someone into an existing plan or system.
