PHRASE->

(Since "glo" is primarily used as a noun describing a visual phenomenon, it doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way as more versatile words.  Therefore, I'm offering examples using its more common synonym "glow" to illustrate phrasal usage relating to light emission.)

glow with pride =  充满自豪
glow with health =  容光焕发
a healthy glow =  健康的容光
take the glow off something = 使某事逊色
glow in the dark =  在黑暗中发光
