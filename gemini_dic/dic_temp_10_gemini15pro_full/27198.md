词源:  Originates from the early 19th century in the United States. Possibly a blend of "calli-" (beautiful) and "thump," ironically referencing the often discordant music played during these parades.  Some sources also suggest a connection to the Scottish word "gallimaufry," meaning a hodgepodge or medley.
