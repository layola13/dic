-atically:/ˈætɪk(ə)li/
| adv. |自动地，系统地| in a systematic or automatic way; in a way that relates to a particular system |The machine works automatically. 机器自动工作。|近义词：systematically, mechanically, routinely|反义词: manually, irregularly|词性:副词

词源:
From Greek *automatos* "self-acting, self-moving," from *autos* "self" + *matos* "thinking, animated, willing."  The suffix *-ic* forms adjectives, and *-ally* forms adverbs.  Therefore, "-atically" ultimately derives from Greek roots meaning "acting of oneself" and has evolved to mean "in a systematic or automatic way."
