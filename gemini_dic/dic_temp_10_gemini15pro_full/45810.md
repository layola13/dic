注意事项:  While "custom's" with an apostrophe exists as a possessive form, it is extremely rare and often a mistake for "customs" (the plural).  It is best to avoid using "custom's" and instead use "customs" or rephrase to avoid the possessive form when discussing the government agency or related procedures. For example, "the customs office" is preferred over "the custom's office."
