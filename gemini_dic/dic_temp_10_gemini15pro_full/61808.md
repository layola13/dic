PHRASE->
(It's less common to use "emphysemas" in phrases, as the singular form "emphysema" is typically used.)

However, for demonstration purposes, and considering the plural form requested:

what about his emphysemas? 他的肺气肿怎么样？
what if the emphysemas worsen?  如果肺气肿恶化怎么办？


注意事项:  The plural form "emphysemas" is grammatically correct but less commonly used than the singular form "emphysema" when referring to the disease in general. The plural would be used when talking about multiple distinct instances of the disease, perhaps in different parts of the lung or in different individuals.
