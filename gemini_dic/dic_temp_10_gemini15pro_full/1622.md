ETYMOLOGY->
From acid + -ness + -'s (possessive).  "Acid" comes from the Latin "acidus," meaning "sour" or "sharp."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  The final "-'s" indicates possession, belonging to the acidness.

USAGE->
There are limited grammatical contexts where "acidness's" would be naturally used due to the double possessive.  While grammatically correct in certain narrow situations, it can sound awkward.  It's generally preferable to rephrase to avoid the double possessive.

Example using "of" to avoid double possessive:
The intensity of the lemon juice's acidness was surprising. = 柠檬汁酸度的强度令人惊讶。
The measurement of the solution's acidness is crucial. = 测量溶液的酸度至关重要。

Possessive with an implied noun:
The lemon's acidness's effect on the metal was immediate. = 柠檬的酸性对金属的影响是立竿见影的. (Here, acidness's effect implies the effect *of* its acidness).
The wine's acidness's contribution to the flavor profile is significant. =  葡萄酒的酸度对风味特征的贡献是显著的。（Here, acidness's contribution implies the contribution *of* its acidness).


PHRASE->
Due to its infrequent use, "acidness's" doesn't appear in common phrases.  It's more typical to see phrases using "acidity" or other synonyms.  Phrases using "acid" are more common, such as "acid rain" or "acid test."
