词源：
From island + -er.  "island" comes from Old English *īegland (attested as īgland, ēgland), from īeg "island" + land "land." The -er suffix denotes "a person or thing that performs a specified action" or "a person or thing associated with a particular characteristic or feature," in this case, living on an island.
