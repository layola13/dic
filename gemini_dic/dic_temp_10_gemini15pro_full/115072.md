Manetho
Manetho, an Egyptian historian and priest who lived during the Ptolemaic era (circa 305-283 BCE), is renowned for his chronicle of ancient Egyptian history, *Aegyptiaca* (History of Egypt).  While the original work is lost, excerpts and summaries survive through later writers like Josephus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Syncellus.
Manetho's account organized Egyptian pharaohs into dynasties, a system still used by Egyptologists today.
The influence of Manetho's work on our understanding of ancient Egypt is immense, even though the accuracy of some of his details is debated.
