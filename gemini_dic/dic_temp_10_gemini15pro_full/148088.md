Etymology:
over- (prefix) + scepticism (noun)

"over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, beyond, across." It intensifies the meaning of the word it's attached to.

"scepticism" comes from Greek "skeptikos" (thoughtful, inquiring), from "skeptesthai" (to look, consider).  It entered English via Late Latin "scepticus" and French "scepticisme."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, belief, or practice.  Therefore, "overscepticism" literally means an excessive degree of inquiry or doubt.
