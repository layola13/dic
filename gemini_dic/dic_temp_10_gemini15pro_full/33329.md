词源:
The word "chuffy" originates from "chuff," which is imitative in origin, referring to the sound of a steam engine. The meaning of "pleasantly plump" likely developed from the image of a well-fed, contented person. The sense of "out of breath" is connected to the exertion required to make puffing sounds.  The meaning "bad-tempered" or "irritated" is thought to have evolved from the idea of being puffed up with indignation.
