词源: From Old French *Avril (modern French avril), from Latin Aprīlis, perhaps from Etruscan Amphile or Apru, after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love (corresponding to the Roman Venus), whose festival was held in April; or perhaps from Latin aperīre "to open," referring to the opening of buds and flowers in spring.
