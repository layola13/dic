PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases, and forcing phrases would be unnatural.  It's primarily a technical term.)


注意事项:

This word is not commonly used outside of specialized biological contexts.  Therefore, creating common phrases feels artificial.  It is best used in its adjectival form to describe structures or characteristics related to the Coelenterata (Cnidaria), particularly those resembling or related to the collar cells (choanocytes) found in sponges and related organisms.
