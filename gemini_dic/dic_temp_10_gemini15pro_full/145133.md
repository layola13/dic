词源：The word "overarticulate" is derived from the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and the verb "articulate" (meaning "to express clearly"). The verb "articulate" comes from the Latin word "articulatus," the past participle of "articulare," meaning "to joint distinctly," ultimately from "artus," meaning "joint."
