nonenzymatically:/ˌnɒnɛnzaɪˈmætɪkli/ | adv. | 非酶促地 |  In a way that does not involve enzymes.  Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms.  "Nonenzymatically" describes processes that occur without the involvement of these catalysts. |  Glucose can be nonenzymatically glycated. 葡萄糖可以非酶促地糖基化。|  The reaction proceeded nonenzymatically. 该反应非酶促地进行。 | synonym: abiotically | antonym: enzymatically | adverb
