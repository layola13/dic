1.  her eightieth birthday = 她的八十岁生日
2.  the eightieth anniversary = 第八十周年纪念日
3.  the eightieth floor = 第八十层楼
4.  the eightieth element = 第八十个元素

注意事项:  Eightieth is primarily used as an adjective to denote a position in a sequence. It is less common than other ordinal numbers due to the relatively few contexts where such a high number is needed.
