cubesat:/ˈkjuːbsæt/| n. |立方体卫星|A miniaturized satellite for space research that is made up of multiples of 10×10×10 cm cubic units.  These small satellites are relatively inexpensive to build and launch, and often perform specific, targeted research. |Example 1:  The university students successfully launched their cubesat into orbit to study solar flares.  大学的学生们成功地将他们的立方体卫星送入轨道，以研究太阳耀斑。

Example 2:  The company is developing a network of cubesats for Earth observation. 该公司正在开发一个用于地球观测的立方体卫星网络。|近义词：minisatellite, microsatellite|反义词:N/A (No direct antonym exists for a specific satellite type)|词性:noun
