词源：The origin of the word "Dixie" is uncertain, but one popular theory connects it to the $10 notes issued by the Citizens' Bank of New Orleans in the pre-Civil War era. These notes featured the French word "dix" (ten) on the back, and the area became known as "Dixieland."  “迪克西”一词的起源不确定，但一个流行的理论将其与内战前时代新奥尔良市民银行发行的10美元钞票联系起来。这些钞票的背面印有法语单词“dix”（十），该地区因此被称为“迪克西之地”。
