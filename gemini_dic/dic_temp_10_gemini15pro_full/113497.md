Etymology:
This word appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) likely based on the word "Lytera," which itself is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It follows the pattern of creating adjectives from place names by adding the suffix "-ian" (e.g., Canadian, Martian).  Without more context about "Lytera," a more precise etymology is impossible.
