actiniums:/ækˈtɪniəm/| n.|锕|A radioactive chemical element, the first member of the actinide series.|Actiniums are used in neutron sources.|近义词:actinide|反义词:|noun
ETYMOLOGY->
From Modern Latin actinium, from Ancient Greek ἀκτίς (aktís, “ray”) + -ium.  Discovered in 1899 by André-Louis Debierne in pitchblende residues left after Marie and Pierre Curie had extracted radium.

USAGE->
Actinium is rarely used in sentences outside of scientific contexts. Here are some examples demonstrating its usage:

一般现在时:
Actinium is a radioactive element. = 锕是一种放射性元素。
Actinium occurs naturally in uranium ores. = 锕天然存在于铀矿石中。


一般过去时:
Actinium was discovered in 1899. = 锕于1899年被发现。
The sample was contaminated with actinium. = 样品被锕污染了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied actinium for its radioactive properties. = 科学家们已经研究了锕的放射性。
The use of actinium has been limited due to its scarcity. = 由于其稀缺性，锕的使用受到限制。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of americium, actinium had been the only known actinide. = 在镅被发现之前，锕是唯一已知的锕系元素。
Researchers had synthesized actinium-225 before they realized its potential in targeted alpha therapy. = 研究人员在意识到锕-225在靶向α治疗中的潜力之前就已经合成了它。


将来时:
Actinium will continue to be studied for its potential applications. = 将继续研究锕的潜在应用。
Further research will explore the use of actinium in medicine. = 进一步的研究将探索锕在医学中的应用。


被动语态:
Actinium is produced by the decay of uranium-235. = 锕是由铀-235衰变产生的。
Actinium-225 is being investigated for its use in cancer treatment. = 锕-225正在被研究用于癌症治疗。



PHRASE->
actinium series = 锕系
actinium-225 = 锕-225
actinium decay = 锕衰变
actinium isotopes = 锕同位素
actinium compounds = 锕化合物
