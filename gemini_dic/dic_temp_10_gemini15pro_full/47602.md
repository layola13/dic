ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *débaucher*, meaning "to corrupt," from *des-* (meaning "away from") and *bauche* (meaning "workshop" or "beam").  The original sense was to entice someone away from work to indulge in pleasure.  Over time, the meaning shifted to its current sense of excessive indulgence.
