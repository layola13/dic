注意事项:

The term "monera" is now outdated and no longer used in modern biological classification.  It has been replaced by the domains Bacteria and Archaea.  While the examples above use the term for illustrative purposes following the prompt's instructions,  it is crucial to be aware of its obsolete status in contemporary scientific discourse.  When discussing these organisms, use the terms "prokaryotes," "bacteria," and "archaea" instead.
