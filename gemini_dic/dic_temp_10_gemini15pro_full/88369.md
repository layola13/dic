hipshot:/ˈhɪpʃɒt/ (US) /ˈhɪpʃɑːt/| adj.|仓促的；草率的；凭直觉的|Done quickly and without careful thought or preparation; based on intuition rather than reasoned consideration.|He made a hipshot decision to sell the stock.|近义词：impulsive, hasty, rash, intuitive, off-the-cuff|反义词：considered, deliberate, thoughtful|词性:形容词

词源:  From *hip* (meaning "from the hip," as in drawing a gun quickly) + *shot* (meaning "a shot" or "an act of shooting").  Originally referred to shooting from the hip without aiming carefully.  The figurative meaning of "acting quickly and without careful thought" developed from this literal sense.
