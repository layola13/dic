myricyl:/ˈmɪrɪsɪl/| adj. n.|三十烷基；肉豆蔻基|Relating to or derived from myricyl alcohol (triacontanol), a long-chain aliphatic alcohol with 30 carbon atoms.  It can also refer to the radical C30H61.| Myricyl palmitate is a major component of beeswax.  蜂蜡的主要成分是三十烷基棕榈酸酯。|近义词:triacontyl|反义词:N/A|词性:adjective, noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From *myricyl alcohol*, coined by Brodie in 1848, from Greek *myrios*  "ten thousand" + *hyle* "wood, matter".  Initially, it was believed to contain a much larger number of carbon atoms, hence the prefix *myri-* (ten thousand).  Later, the actual number was determined to be thirty.
