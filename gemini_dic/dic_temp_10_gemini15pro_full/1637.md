acinetiform:/əˈsɪnɪtɪfɔːrm/
adjective
不动孢子状的；似不动孢子的
Resembling an akinete, a non-motile, thick-walled resting spore formed by some filamentous cyanobacteria.  The term describes a shape or form, specifically one that is similar to these specialized survival cells.
The researchers observed acinetiform cells within the cyanobacterial sample. 研究人员在蓝藻样本中观察到了不动孢子状细胞。
The microorganism exhibited an acinetiform morphology.  这种微生物呈现出不动孢子状的形态。

近义词:akinete-like
反义词:motile, vegetative
词性:adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From akinete + -iform.  Akinete comes from Greek  *akinētos "motionless," from a- "not" + kinētos "moved, moving."  The suffix -iform means "having the form of."


USAGE->
The adjective "acinetiform" is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in microbiology and phycology (the study of algae).  Here are some example sentences demonstrating its usage in different grammatical contexts:

一般现在时:
The acinetiform cell is resistant to harsh environmental conditions. = 不动孢子状细胞对恶劣的环境条件具有抵抗力。
This species of cyanobacteria produces acinetiform spores during periods of stress. =  这种蓝藻在压力时期会产生不动孢子状的孢子。

一般过去时:
The researchers identified acinetiform structures in the fossilized microbial mat. = 研究人员在微生物席化石中发现了不动孢子状结构。
The sample initially contained acinetiform cells, but they germinated after rehydration. = 样本最初包含不动孢子状细胞，但在再水化后它们发芽了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed acinetiform cells in various cyanobacterial species. = 科学家们在各种蓝藻物种中观察到了不动孢子状细胞。
The culture has developed numerous acinetiform structures in response to nutrient depletion. = 培养物形成了许多不动孢子状结构以应对营养耗竭。


过去完成时:
The cyanobacteria had formed acinetiform spores before the onset of drought conditions. = 在干旱条件开始之前，蓝藻已经形成了不动孢子状孢子。
Researchers had documented acinetiform morphology in this species prior to the current study. = 在目前的研究之前，研究人员已经记录了该物种中的不动孢子状形态。


将来时:
If the environmental stress continues, the cyanobacteria will likely produce more acinetiform cells. = 如果环境压力持续存在，蓝藻可能会产生更多不动孢子状细胞。
The researchers will analyze the acinetiform structures to determine their chemical composition. = 研究人员将分析不动孢子状结构以确定其化学成分。


被动语态:
Acinetiform morphology was observed in the samples collected from the lake. = 在从湖中收集的样本中观察到了不动孢子状形态。
The acinetiform cells are being studied to understand their role in cyanobacterial survival. =  正在研究不动孢子状细胞以了解它们在蓝藻生存中的作用。
