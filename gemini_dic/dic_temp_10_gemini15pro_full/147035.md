Etymology:
From over- + lap (v.) "to fold, wrap," from Old English læppan "to lap up with the tongue, to enfold," related to lopa "loose flap, fold of a garment," from Proto-Germanic *lapp- (source also of Old Norse lapa "to hang down, flap," Old High German laffan "to lick up," German lappen "rag, patch, lobe"), perhaps ultimately from PIE root *leb- "to hang loosely, droop." The sense of "to extend over so as to partly cover" is first recorded late 14c.
