Etymology:
From earlier dumb (meaning “mute, unable to speak”), from Proto-Germanic *dumbaz (“dumb, stupid”). Related to Dutch dom (“stupid”), German dumm (“stupid”), and Old Norse dumba (“to be silent”). The meaning shifted from “mute” to “stupid” probably because those unable to speak were sometimes perceived as unintelligent.
