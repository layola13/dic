From Middle English *joies, plural of joie, from Anglo-Norman joie, from Old French joie (“joy”), from Latin gaudia, plural of gaudium (“joy, gladness”).


注意事项: "joyes" is an archaic plural form of "joy". In modern English, the standard plural is "joys".  While grammatically correct in older texts, using "joyes" in contemporary writing might sound affected or unusual.
