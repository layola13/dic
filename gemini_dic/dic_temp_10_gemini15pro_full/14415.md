autotropism: /ɔːˈtɒtrəpɪzəm/ (British) /ˌɔːtoʊˈtroʊpɪzəm/ (American) | n. | 向性, 自动向性 | The involuntary orientation of an organism or part of an organism in response to an external stimulus, such as light or gravity.  It describes the automatic growth or movement of an organism in a particular direction in response to an external stimulus. | Example 1: The plant exhibited positive autotropism towards the sunlight.  植物表现出对阳光的正向性。

Example 2:  The roots displayed negative autotropism, growing away from the light source.  根部表现出负向性，远离光源。| Synonym: tropism | Antonym:  N/A (No direct antonym; could consider "random growth" in some contexts) | noun
