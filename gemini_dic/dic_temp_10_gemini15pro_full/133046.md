词源：
"nonephemerally" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "ephemeral" (meaning "lasting for a short time").  "Ephemeral" itself comes from the Greek word "ephēmeros," meaning "lasting only a day."  Therefore, "nonephemerally" means "not lasting for a short time," or "permanently."
