词源：From code + -ing.  Code itself comes from the French word code, ultimately deriving from the Latin codex, meaning "tree trunk" or "block of wood," which then came to mean "book" (because early books were written on wooden tablets).  The meaning evolved to refer to a system of symbols, and eventually to computer code.
