karyostenotic: /ˌkærioʊstɪˈnɑːtɪk/ | adj. | 核分裂受抑制的；核分裂减少的 |  Characterized by or causing the suppression or reduction of karyokinesis (nuclear division).  This term describes a condition where the nucleus of a cell has difficulty dividing, often resulting in fewer cells or cells with abnormal nuclei. |  Karyostenotic substances can inhibit tumor growth. 核分裂受抑制的物质可以抑制肿瘤生长。
The drug exhibited karyostenotic effects on the cancer cells.  这种药物对癌细胞表现出核分裂抑制效应。 | 近义词: antimitotic, mitosis-inhibiting | 反义词: mitogenic, mitosis-promoting | 词性: adjective

词源:
karyo- (Greek) : nucleus (核)
stenotic (Greek): narrowed, constricted (狭窄的，收缩的)
