Etymology->

From Late Latin *discriminātōrius*, from Latin discrimināre (“to distinguish, separate, divide”) + -tōrius (forming adjectives of purpose).  The Latin verb is derived from dis- (“apart”) + crimen (“judgment, accusation, charge”).  The original sense therefore relates to distinguishing between right and wrong.
