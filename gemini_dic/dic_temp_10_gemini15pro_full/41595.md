注意事项:

*  "Corpsy" is generally considered informal, humorous, or euphemistic.  Avoid using it in formal contexts.  "Body," "remains," or "cadaver" are more appropriate for formal situations.

* The etymology of "corpsy" is straightforward. It's derived directly from "corpse" with the added "-y" suffix, often used to create informal or affectionate terms.  The word "corpse" itself comes from Old French "cors" meaning "body," ultimately from Latin "corpus."
