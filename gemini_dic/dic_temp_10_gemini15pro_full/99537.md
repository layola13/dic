词源：
"Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among."
"Gossiping" is the present participle of the verb "gossip," meaning to talk about the personal affairs of others.
Therefore, "intergossiping" literally means "gossiping among (themselves)."  This word isn't standard English and is a neologism formed by combining the prefix "inter-" with "gossiping."  While not commonly used, it is understandable in context.
