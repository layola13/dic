emulsin: /ɪˈmʌlsɪn/ | n. | 乳糖酶，苦杏仁酶 | An enzyme found in almonds and other seeds that catalyzes the hydrolysis of certain glycosides.  It's a mixture of enzymes, including β-glucosidase, which breaks down amygdalin into glucose, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide. | Almonds contain emulsin, which breaks down amygdalin. 杏仁含有苦杏仁酶，它可以分解苦杏仁苷。| Emulsin plays a crucial role in the release of cyanide from amygdalin.  苦杏仁酶在苦杏仁苷释放氰化物中起着至关重要的作用。 | synonym: β-glucosidase (partially synonymous, as emulsin is a mixture containing β-glucosidase) | antonym:  (No direct antonym for an enzyme) | noun
