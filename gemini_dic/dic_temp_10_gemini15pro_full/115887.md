词源:
From Portuguese *marmelada (attested from the 16th century), from marmelo "quince", from Latin melimelum, from Ancient Greek μελίμηλον (melímēlon, “honey apple”), from μέλι (méli, “honey”) + μῆλον (mῆlon, “apple”). The original marmalade was made from quinces.  The shift to citrus fruit occurred later. 最初的橘子酱是用榅桲做的。后来才改用柑橘类水果。
