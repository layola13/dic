近义词: inseparability, indivisibility, unity
反义词: separability, divisibility
词性: noun


Etymology:  non- + separable + -ness + -es
From "nonseparable," meaning "not able to be separated," formed by the prefix "non-" (not) added to "separable."  "Separable" comes from the Latin "separabilis," meaning "that can be separated," from "separare" (to separate). The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. Finally, "-es" marks the plural form.
