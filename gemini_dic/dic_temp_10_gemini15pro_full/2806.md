ETYMOLOGY->
From "advantaged," the past participle of the verb "advantage," meaning "to give an advantage to" or "to benefit."  "Advantage" comes from the Old French "avantage," derived from "avant" meaning "before" or "forward." Ultimately, from the Latin "abante" meaning "from before."  The -'s is a possessive suffix, indicating ownership or belonging.

注意事项:

"Advantaged's" is not a standard English word. While grammatically possible as the possessive form of "advantaged," it's very rarely used and sounds awkward. It's much more common and natural to use "advantages" (plural) or rephrase the sentence to avoid this construction. For example, instead of "the advantaged's perspective," one could say "the perspective of the advantaged" or "the perspective of those who are advantaged."
