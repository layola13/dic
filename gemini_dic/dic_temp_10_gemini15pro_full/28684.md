ETYMOLOGY->
Carjacking is a portmanteau of "car" and "hijacking,"  first recorded in 1991.  "Hijacking" itself dates back to the early 20th century, originating in American slang and referring to the robbery of illegal liquor shipments during Prohibition. The "hi-" prefix in "hijack" might be related to the command "Hi!" used to get someone's attention.
