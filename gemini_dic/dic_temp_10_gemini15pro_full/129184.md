词源:
From the earlier noun *nobble* "head," specifically of a horse, from which the verb developed in the sense of "to strike on the head," and later "to disable."  The figurative sense of "to tamper with" arose in the late 19th century.  来自早期名词 *nobble* “头部”，特指马的头部，动词由此发展而来，意为“击打头部”，后来引申为“使残废”。  “篡改”的比喻义出现在19世纪后期。
