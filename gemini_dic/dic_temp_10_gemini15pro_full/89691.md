ETYMOLOGY->
Origin uncertain, possibly from American slang.  One theory suggests it might be a fanciful alteration of "holler," "howl," or other words suggesting noisy revelry. Another suggests a Scottish origin, related to "hoose" (house).  It gained popularity in the 1950s and 60s with the folk music revival.
