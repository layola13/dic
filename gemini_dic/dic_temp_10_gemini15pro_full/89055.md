holohemihedral:/ˌhɒləʊˌhɛmiˈhiːdrəl/ | adj. |全半面象的|Crystal form exhibiting only half the faces of the normal hemihedral form. It is a type of crystal symmetry where only half of the faces required for full hemihedrism are present. |Example: The holohemihedral form of pyrite exhibits distinctive cubic crystals.| 近义词: hemihedral (somewhat)| 反义词: holohedral |词性: adjective
