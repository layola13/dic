词源:

From over- + balance.  The verb sense dates from the late 16th century, and the noun sense from the early 17th century.  "Over-" is a common prefix meaning "too much" or "excessive." "Balance" comes from Old French "balance" (scales), from Late Latin "bilanx" (having two scales), from Latin "bis" (twice) + "lanx" (plate, dish, scale of a balance).
