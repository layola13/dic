PHRASE->
(Not commonly used as part of a set phrase.  Dilatation is typically used in a more technical/medical context.)


词源：
From Late Latin *dīlātātiōn-em, accusative singular of dīlātātiō (“a widening, extending”), from Latin dīlātō (“I spread out, extend, enlarge”), from dī- (“apart, asunder”) + lātus (“wide, broad”).

注意事项:
Dilatation and dilation are both acceptable spellings, although dilatation is more common in British English.
