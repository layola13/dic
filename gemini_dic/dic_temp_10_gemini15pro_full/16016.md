词源: From French *banal* "belonging to the ban" (thus, "common, shared by all"), from Old French *ban* "proclamation, jurisdiction, district under a ban," from Frankish *ban* "summons, ban," from Proto-Germanic *bannan* "to speak, summon."  The semantic shift occurred because things belonging to the ban were available to everyone, hence common and ordinary.
