Etymology:
"inrail" appears to be a relatively recent formation, likely arising from the combining form "in-" (meaning "in," "into," or "within") and "rail" (referring to railroads or railway systems). While not as established as terms like "by rail" or "via rail," its meaning is readily understandable in context.
