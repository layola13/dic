nonelectrics:/ˌnɒnɪˈlɛktrɪks/
| n. | 非电介质 | Substances that could not be electrically charged by rubbing, as opposed to "electrics" which could. | Early scientists experimented with rubbing different materials together to generate static electricity.  They classified materials that could be charged as "electrics" and those that couldn't as "nonelectrics." |  In the 18th century, scientists considered water a nonelectric. | 近义词: conductor | 反义词: electric, dielectric | 词性: 名词
