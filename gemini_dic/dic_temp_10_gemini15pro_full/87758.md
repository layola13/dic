hfc:/ˈeɪtʃˌɛfˈsiː/ | n. |氢氟烃; 氢氟碳化物| A hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) is any of several organic compounds composed of hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.  HFCs are produced synthetically and are used primarily as refrigerants. |HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases. 氢氟烃是强效的温室气体。| The use of HFCs is being phased out due to their environmental impact.  由于对环境的影响，氢氟烃的使用正在逐步淘汰。| synonyms: refrigerant, coolant | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but perhaps "natural refrigerant" like propane or ammonia could be considered a contextual antonym) | noun
