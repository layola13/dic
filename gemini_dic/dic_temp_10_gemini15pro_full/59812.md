词源:  From Late Latin ecstaticus, from Greek ekstatikos “beside oneself, ecstatic,” from ekstasis “displacement, trance,” from existanai “displace, put out of its place,” from ex- “out” + histanai “to cause to stand.”  The original sense was of being “out of one's mind" with any strong emotion, including fear or astonishment.  The restriction to positive emotions occurred by the late 17th century.
