acrylamides: /əˈkrɪləmaɪdz/
noun
丙烯酰胺
A group of organic compounds with the chemical formula CH2=CHCONH2 (acrylamide itself) or a substituted derivative.  They are unsaturated amides that can polymerize to form polyacrylamides.
Acrylamide is a chemical that can form when starchy foods are cooked at high temperatures. = 丙烯酰胺是一种化学物质，在淀粉类食物高温烹饪时会形成。
Acrylamides are found in many processed foods. = 丙烯酰胺存在于许多加工食品中。
Synonyms: 2-propenamide, acrylic amide
Antonyms: None (chemical compounds don't typically have antonyms)
n.

ETYMOLOGY->
From acrylic + amide.  "Acrylic" comes from acrolein, from Latin acer "sharp" + oleum "oil", due to its pungent smell. "Amide" refers to the chemical group -CONH2.

Scientists had not realized the extent to which these chemicals were present in common foods. = 科学家们没有意识到这些化学物质在常见食物中的存在程度。

将来时:
Further research will investigate the long-term effects of acrylamide exposure. = 进一步的研究将调查丙烯酰胺暴露的长期影响。
Food manufacturers will continue to develop methods to minimize acrylamide formation. = 食品制造商将继续开发方法以最大限度地减少丙烯酰胺的形成。

虚拟语气:
If food manufacturers could eliminate acrylamides completely, they would. = 如果食品制造商能够完全消除丙烯酰胺，他们会的。
I wish there were no acrylamides in my favorite foods. = 我希望我最喜欢的食物中没有丙烯酰胺。

被动语态:
Acrylamides are formed during high-temperature cooking. = 丙烯酰胺是在高温烹饪过程中形成的。
Methods to reduce acrylamide levels are being investigated. = 正在研究降低丙烯酰胺含量的方法。

疑问句:
Are acrylamides harmful to human health? = 丙烯酰胺对人体健康有害吗？
What foods contain the highest levels of acrylamides? = 哪些食物中丙烯酰胺的含量最高？

否定句:
Acrylamides are not found in all foods. = 并非所有食物中都含有丙烯酰胺。
There is no conclusive evidence that acrylamides cause cancer in humans. = 没有确凿的证据表明丙烯酰胺会导致人类患癌症。



PHRASE->
levels of acrylamides = 丙烯酰胺含量
formation of acrylamides = 丙烯酰胺的形成
