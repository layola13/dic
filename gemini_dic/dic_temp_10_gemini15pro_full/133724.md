词源：
"Nonfrustrations" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "frustrations."  "Frustration" comes from the Late Latin "frustrationem,"  meaning "a deceiving, disappointment," from the past participle stem of "frustrare" "to deceive, disappoint, make vain," from "frustrā" "in vain."
