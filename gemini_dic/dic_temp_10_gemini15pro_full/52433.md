didymium:/dɪˈdɪmiəm/
n.| 钕混合物；混合稀土金属|A mixture of rare earth elements, primarily praseodymium and neodymium, formerly considered an element.|Didymium glass is used in glassblowing to make certain colors.|近义词:mischmetal (混合稀土金属)|反义词:None|名词


ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek δίδυμος (dídymos, “twin”) + -ium.  So named because it was originally thought to be a single element, but was later discovered to be a mixture of two very similar elements (praseodymium and neodymium).
