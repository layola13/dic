ETYMOLOGY->
From lime + scale.  Lime refers to calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), which are alkaline substances. Scale refers to a thin flake or crust.  Limescale forms when hard water, containing dissolved calcium and magnesium bicarbonates, is heated. The bicarbonates decompose, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving behind insoluble calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide, which precipitate out and form the scale.
