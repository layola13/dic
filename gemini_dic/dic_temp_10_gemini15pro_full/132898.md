词源:
"nonelectrification" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") added to "electrification." "Electrification" itself is derived from "electric" + "-fication" (a suffix forming nouns of action or process). "Electric" ultimately comes from the Greek word "elektron" meaning "amber," as static electricity was first observed by rubbing amber.
