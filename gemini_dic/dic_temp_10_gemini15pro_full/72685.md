ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "fob," which originated in the late 16th century.  While the exact etymology is uncertain, it's thought to be related to the German word "foppen" meaning "to mock, fool, or hoax."  The meaning evolved from the idea of presenting something deceptively, like a fob (a small pocket watch or ornament), as something of greater value.
