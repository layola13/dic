opsonization:/ˌɒpsənaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 调理作用，调理作用 | The process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte.  This is achieved by coating the pathogen with opsonins. | Example 1: Opsonization is a crucial step in the immune response. 调理作用是免疫反应中的关键步骤。

Example 2:  The antibodies acted as opsonins, facilitating opsonization of the bacteria. 抗体充当调理素，促进细菌的调理作用。 | Near Synonyms: immune adherence,  phagocytosis enhancement | Antonyms:  immunosuppression | Noun
