词性：adjective

Etymology:  "distrustless" is formed by combining the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") with the word "trustless".  "Trustless" itself is a somewhat unusual word, generally meaning "lacking trust" or "not inspiring trust". Therefore, "distrustless" essentially negates a negative, creating a positive meaning of "full of trust" or "free from distrust."  The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something.
