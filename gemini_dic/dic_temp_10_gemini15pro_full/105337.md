词源： "Kick on" originated as a phrasal verb in British English, with "kick" likely referring to a sudden burst of energy or action, and "on" indicating continuation.  The precise origin is difficult to pinpoint, but it likely evolved from sporting contexts, where "kick off" signifies the start of a game, and "kick on" became associated with resuming play after a pause.
