近义词:imperceptibility, invisibility, undetectability
反义词:perceptibility, visibility, detectability
词性:noun (plural)


Etymology:
From non- + perceptible + -ity + -ies.  "Perceptible" comes from Late Middle English: from late Latin perceptibilis, from Latin percept- ‘seized, grasped’ (past participle of percipere) + -ibilis (forming adjectives). "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not". "-ity" is a suffix forming nouns of quality or state. "-ies" marks the plural form.
