ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *techen*, from Old English *tǣcan* (“to show, point out, direct, teach, instruct”), from Proto-Germanic *taikijan* (“to show”), from Proto-Indo-European *deḱ- (“to show, pronounce solemnly”). Cognate with Old Frisian *tēka* (“to show”), Old Saxon *tācan* (“to show”), Middle Dutch *teken* (“to show, indicate, draw”), Dutch *tekenen* (“to draw”), Old High German *zeichen* (“sign, token”), German *zeigen* (“to show”), Old Norse *tákn* (“sign, token”), Gothic *taikns* (“sign, token”). More at teach. The passive form "be taught" arises naturally from the transitive nature of "teach."
