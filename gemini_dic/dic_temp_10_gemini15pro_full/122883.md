molluscoidea:/ˌmɒləskɔɪˈdiːə/ | n. | 苔藓动物门；苔藓虫类 | A taxonomic group, now considered obsolete, that formerly included brachiopods, bryozoans, and phoronids, animals that share a lophophore (a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth).  It is no longer considered a valid taxonomic grouping. |  Molluscoidea was once thought to be a major phylum. 苔藓动物门曾被认为是一个主要的动物门。

Molluscoidea is no longer a valid phylogenetic group. 苔藓动物门不再是一个有效的系统发育群。 | 近义词:  (Historically) Lophophorata | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun
