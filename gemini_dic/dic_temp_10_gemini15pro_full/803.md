n.


ETYMOLOGY->
From absorb + -ivity.  Absorb comes from Latin absorbere "to swallow up," from ab- "away" + sorbere "to suck in."  The suffix -ivity denotes a state or quality.

USAGE->
The absorptivity of the material is a key factor in its performance. =  这种材料的吸收率是其性能的关键因素。

Different colors have different absorptivities. = 不同的颜色有不同的吸收率。

PHRASE->
spectral absorptivity = 光谱吸收率
molar absorptivity = 摩尔吸收率
high absorptivity = 高吸收率
low absorptivity = 低吸收率
absorptivity coefficient = 吸收系数
