词源:

Daan comes from Dutch and Afrikaans. It is related to the Dutch word "gedaan" (done, finished) and shares a common ancestor with the English word "deed".  It retains this sense of "something done" or "something accomplished" in some contexts, especially when referring to a judgment or decision.  In other contexts, it has taken on the meaning of "gift" or "boon".
