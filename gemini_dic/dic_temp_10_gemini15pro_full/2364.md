词性: adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *a-* (not) + *diathermanos* (transparent to heat), from *dia-* (through) + *therme* (heat).  最终来自希腊语，由表示“不”的 *a-*  加上 *diathermanos*（透热的）组成，*diathermanos* 又由 *dia-*（通过）和 *therme*（热）组成。


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.  It's not common in everyday conversation.  这个词主要用于科学和技术语境，在日常对话中不常见。
