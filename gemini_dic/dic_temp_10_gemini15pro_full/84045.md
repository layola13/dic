PHRASE->
(This word is highly technical and doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases.  It's primarily used in scientific contexts.)


词源： "half-" (Old English healf) + "fertile" (from Latin fertilis) + "-ness" (Old English -nes).  The "-ness" suffix turns the adjective "half-fertile" into a noun.
