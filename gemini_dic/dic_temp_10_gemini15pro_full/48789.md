deflectionization:/ˌdiːflekʃənɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 反射化，偏转化 | The process of making something deflect or cause deflection.  This word is not commonly used and might be considered jargon in specific technical fields.  It's formed from "deflection" + "-ization," which is a suffix used to form nouns meaning the process or result of doing something. | The deflectionization of the light beam allowed for precise measurements. 光束的反射化使得精确测量成为可能。|  The deflectionization of the radar signal by the metallic surface caused interference. 雷达信号被金属表面反射化造成了干扰。 |  deviation, refraction, reflection |  - | noun
