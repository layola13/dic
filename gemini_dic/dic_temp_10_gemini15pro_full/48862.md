Etymology: From "deformed" + "-ness". "Deformed" comes from the Old French "deformer" (to deform), which in turn derives from the Latin "deformare" (to disfigure, deform), from "de-" (from, away from) + "formare" (to form, shape).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
