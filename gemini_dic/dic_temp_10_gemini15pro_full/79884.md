gnathidium:/næˈθɪdiəm/| n. |颚基;口器基部|The gnathobase, sometimes called the gnathochilarium, is a plate formed by the fusion of the paired maxillae in the mouth of some arthropods, such as the myriapods. The gnathobase is located on the labium or lower lip of the insect's mouth. Gnathochilarium is a more specific term referring to the fused maxillae found in millipedes, while gnathobase can refer to similar structures in other arthropods.| Millipedes use their gnathochilarium for chewing and manipulating food. 千足虫用它们的颚基咀嚼和处理食物。|近义词：gnathobase, gnathochilarium|反义词: (No direct antonym)|词性:noun
