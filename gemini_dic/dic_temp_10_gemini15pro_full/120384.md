注意事项:  "Minirth" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism (newly coined word) likely combining "mini" and "Earth."  Therefore, standard dictionaries won't contain it. The analysis above is based on the most likely intended meaning and how such a word would function grammatically if it were to become common usage.
