co-inheritance:/ˌkoʊɪnˈhɛrɪtəns/ | n. |共同继承，多重继承| The process where a class inherits from multiple base classes.  It allows a derived class to acquire the properties and behaviors of several parent classes. | Example:  The `FlyingCar` class demonstrates co-inheritance by inheriting from both the `Car` class and the `Airplane` class.  飞行汽车类通过继承汽车类和飞机类来演示共同继承。

Example: Co-inheritance can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies and potential ambiguity if not managed carefully. 共同继承如果管理不善，会导致复杂的继承层次结构和潜在的歧义。 | 近义词: multiple inheritance | 反义词: single inheritance | 词性: noun
