nonreductional:/ˌnɒnrɪˈdʌkʃənəl/
adjective
非减数的
Relating to or denoting meiosis in which the chromosome number is not reduced.  Not involving or characterized by reduction.
The first meiotic division is nonreductional, meaning that the number of chromosomes is not halved.  第一次减数分裂是非减数的，意味着染色体数目没有减半。
The nonreductional nature of the division ensured that the chromosome number remained stable.  这种分裂的非减数性质确保了染色体数目的稳定。
