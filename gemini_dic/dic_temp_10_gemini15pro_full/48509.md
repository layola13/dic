PHRASE->
(Since "deeri" is a very specific Gaelic word, common phrases don't really apply.  It's used like the English word "deer.")

There are no direct antonyms or readily available phrases in the same way as English because of the specific context of Gaelic.  This word simply refers to the animal.  More complex phrases would require a deeper understanding of Gaelic sentence structure and idiom.
