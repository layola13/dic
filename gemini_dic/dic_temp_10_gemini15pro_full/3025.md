一般现在时:
The aeriform substance expands when heated. = 加热时，气态物质会膨胀。
This chemical exists in an aeriform state at room temperature. = 这种化学物质在室温下以气态存在。

一般过去时:
The released gas quickly became aeriform. = 释放的气体迅速变成了气态。
The substance transitioned to an aeriform state after the reaction. = 反应后，该物质转变为气态。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several aeriform compounds in the atmosphere. = 科学家们已经在大气中识别出几种气态化合物。
The experiment has demonstrated the aeriform nature of the substance. = 实验已经证明了该物质的气态性质。

过去完成时:
The substance had already become aeriform before we could analyze it. = 在我们能够分析它之前，这种物质就已经变成了气态。
After the pressure had been reduced, the liquid had turned aeriform. = 压力降低后，液体变成了气态。

将来时:
The gas will become aeriform once it reaches a certain temperature. = 一旦达到一定温度，气体就会变成气态。

疑问句:
Is the compound aeriform at this altitude? = 在这个高度下，该化合物是气态的吗？
Why does the substance become aeriform when heated? = 为什么这种物质加热后会变成气态？


否定句:
The substance is not aeriform at standard temperature and pressure. = 该物质在标准温度和压力下不是气态的。
The experiment did not produce any aeriform byproducts. = 实验没有产生任何气态副产品。


PHRASE->
"Aeriform state" = 气态
"Aeriform substance" = 气态物质
"Aeriform compound" = 气态化合物
"Transition to an aeriform state" = 转变为气态
"Exist in an aeriform state" = 以气态存在
