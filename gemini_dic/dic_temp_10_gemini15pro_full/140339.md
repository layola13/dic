ohings:  This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a standard linguistic analysis is impossible.  It might be intended as a plural of "ohing," which itself is not a standard dictionary word but could be understood as the act of saying "oh."

If we were to analyze "ohing" hypothetically, based on its potential meaning as "the act of saying 'oh'," it would look something like this:

ohing: /ˈoʊɪŋ/ | n. | 哦，感叹 | The act of expressing surprise, understanding, or sympathy by saying "oh." |  She responded with a series of ohings and ahings. 她一连串地发出“哦”和“啊”的声音。| synonyms: exclaiming, reacting | antonyms: silence, apathy | noun
