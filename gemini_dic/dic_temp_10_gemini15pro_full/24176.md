brickleness:/ˈbrɪkəlnəs/
n.|脆性，易碎性|The quality of being brittle; easily broken.|The brickleness of the glass made it unsuitable for the project. 玻璃的脆性使其不适合该项目。|fragility, brittleness, frangibility|toughness, strength|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From brittle + -ness.  Brittle comes from Old English *bryttian "to break," from Proto-Germanic *breutan (source also of Old Norse brjóta "to break," Old Frisian briata, Middle Dutch bruten, Old High German brestan "to burst," German bersten "to burst").  The suffix -ness forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
