ETYMOLOGY->
From "bunt," meaning the middle part of a sail, + "line."  来自“bunt”（意为帆的中间部分）+“line”（意为绳索）。  Originally referred to ropes used to control sails, but later became associated with long-barreled revolvers, possibly due to their association with fictional Western characters like Wyatt Earp. 最初指的是用来控制帆的绳索，但后来与长枪管左轮手枪联系在一起，可能是因为它们与怀亚特·厄普等虚构的西部人物有关。
