词源: baking (n.) comes from bake (v.), from Old English *bacan "to bake," from Proto-Germanic *bakan (source also of Old Norse baka, Old Frisian bakia, Middle Dutch backen, Old High German bahhan, German backen), from PIE root *bheg- "to bake, roast, fry."  The "-ings" suffix transforms the verb into a gerund or verbal noun, indicating the product or result of the action.
