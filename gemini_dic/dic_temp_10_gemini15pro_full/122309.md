ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *mytens, *mittens, from Old French mitaine (mitten, glove), perhaps from mite (cat) + -aine (suffix forming feminine nouns), implying a soft, cat-like paw covering.  Alternatively, it might be related to the Germanic root *mit- (with, together), referring to the four fingers being held together.
