lipoproteins:/ˌlɪpoʊˈproʊtiːnz/, /ˌlɪpəʊˈprəʊtiːnz/ | n. | 脂蛋白 |  Biologically occurring complexes of lipids with proteins. Lipids are not soluble in water, so they are transported in the blood plasma as lipoproteins. | High levels of low-density lipoproteins are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.  高密度脂蛋白水平高与心脏病风险增加有关。| synonyms: lipoprotein particle | antonyms:  (No direct antonym for a biological complex.  One might consider terms related to individual components, like "free fatty acids" as a contrast to the bound form in lipoproteins, but this isn't a true antonym.) | noun

lipoprotein:/ˌlɪpoʊˈproʊtiːn/, /ˌlɪpəʊˈprəʊtiːn/ | n. | 脂蛋白 |  A biochemical assembly that contains both proteins and lipids, bound to each other, which allow fats and cholesterol to move through the water inside and outside of cells.  |  Lipoprotein levels are often checked during routine blood tests.  脂蛋白水平通常在常规血液检查中进行检查。 | synonyms: lipoprotein particle | antonyms: (No direct antonym exists) | noun
