disassimilative:/dɪsəˈsɪmɪlətɪv/
adjective
异化的，分解代谢的
Relating to or involving dissimilation; catabolic.  Breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, often releasing energy.
Dissimilative metabolism provides the energy needed for anabolism.  异化代谢提供合成代谢所需的能量。
Dissimilative processes, such as respiration, release energy. 分解过程，如呼吸作用，会释放能量。
近义词: catabolic, degradative
