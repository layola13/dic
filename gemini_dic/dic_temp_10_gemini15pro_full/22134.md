boltonite:/ˈboʊltəˌnaɪt/
n.
硅镁石
A mineral, magnesium silicate, found in igneous rocks and meteorites.
Boltonite is a rare mineral found in some meteorites. 硅镁石是一种罕见的矿物，存在于一些陨石中。
Boltonite alterations can be observed in the thin sections. 在薄片中可以观察到硅镁石蚀变。
近义词:forsterite,  peridot (in some contexts, as both are magnesium-rich silicates)
反义词:N/A (Minerals typically don't have direct antonyms)
词性:noun

词源:Named after James Bolton (1735-1799), an English naturalist and botanist.
