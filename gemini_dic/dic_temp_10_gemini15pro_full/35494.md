coadaptation:/ˌkoʊˌædæpˈteɪʃən/ |n.|共同适应，协同适应|The process by which two or more species, genes, or phenotypic traits undergo adaptation as a result of mutual influence.  It often involves reciprocal evolutionary changes in interacting species or systems.|Example 1: The coadaptation of flowers and their pollinators is a classic example of evolutionary interaction. 花与传粉者的共同适应是进化互作的经典例子。

Example 2:  The coadaptation between predator and prey is a continuous arms race. 捕食者和猎物之间的共同适应是一场持续的军备竞赛。|近义词：coevolution, mutual adaptation|反义词: maladaptation|词性: 名词
