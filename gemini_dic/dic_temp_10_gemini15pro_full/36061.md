词源:  "Coeder" is a less common variant of "coder," which comes from "code" + "-er" (agent suffix). "Code" itself ultimately derives from the Latin "codex," meaning "tree trunk, block of wood, book."  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass systems of symbols, and eventually computer programming instructions.


注意事项:
While "coeder" is understandable, "coder" is the more commonly accepted and preferred spelling.  It's recommended to use "coder" in professional and formal contexts.
