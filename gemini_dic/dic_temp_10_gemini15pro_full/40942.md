注意事项:  It is crucial to remember that while "coons" can refer to raccoons, it is also a deeply offensive racial slur.  Avoid using this word unless specifically referring to the animal in a context where no racial connotation could be inferred.  Even then, consider using "raccoons" to avoid any potential misunderstanding or offense.
