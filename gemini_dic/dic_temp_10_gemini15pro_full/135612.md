"non-" (prefix):  from Latin, meaning "not"
"postpone": from "post-" (Latin, "after") + "ponere" (Latin, "to place")
"-ment" (suffix): forms nouns from verbs, indicating the result or product of an action.
Thus, "nonpostponement" literally means the "not placing after" or "not delaying" of something.
