词源： "Chill" comes from the Old English *ciele, *cele, meaning "cold," which relates to the Proto-Germanic *kalaz. The meaning evolved from the physical sensation of coldness to the metaphorical sense of calmness and relaxation. "Out" simply intensifies the verb, implying a complete release of tension.
