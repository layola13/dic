ETYMOLOGY->
From Old Norse *mjúkr (whence also Norwegian mjuk, Swedish mjuk), from Proto-Germanic *mewkjaz "soft, weak" (whence also Old English mēce "meek"), from Proto-Indo-European *meug- "slimy, slippery."  Related to mucus.  The semantic development is from "soft" to "pliant," hence "gentle" and "submissive."
