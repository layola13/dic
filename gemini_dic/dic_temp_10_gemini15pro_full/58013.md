Etymology:
drizzle (n.) - from Old English *drisle, frequentative of drosen "to fall in drops," related to dreosan "to fall," from Proto-Germanic *dreusanan.
puss (n.) -  A shortening of "pussycat," ultimately from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish pusekatt.  The connection to a cat likely stems from the perceived sullen or grumpy expression often associated with the word.
