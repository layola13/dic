ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *obreptitius, from obreptus (“stolen, secret”), perfect passive participle of obrepo (“to creep up on, steal upon, surprise”), from ob (“towards, against”) + repo (“to creep”).  源自拉丁语 *obreptitius，来自 obreptus（“被盗的，秘密的”），是 obrepo（“偷偷靠近，偷袭，使吃惊”）的完成被动分词，来自 ob（“朝向，反对”）+ repo（“爬行”）。
