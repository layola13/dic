词源:
From Latin *genialis* "of or belonging to marriage, nuptial, productive, cheerful," from *genius* "guardian deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth; inborn nature, innate ability," in later use "noble descent, high mental capacity."  The sense evolution appears to be from "festive, of or relating to marriage" to "cheerful, jovial."
