词源：

Both "desert" (to abandon) and "dissert" (to discuss) ultimately derive from Latin.

* **Desert (v.):** From Latin *deserere*, from *de-* (away from) + *serere* (to join, link).  The sense evolution involves the idea of breaking the link or bond of duty or service.

* **Dissert (v.):** From Latin *dissertare*, frequentative of *disserere* (to discuss, examine), from *dis-* (apart, thoroughly) + *serere* (to join, link). The sense here relates to connecting ideas in a detailed discussion.
