AGV:/ˌeɪdʒiːˈviː/ |n.| 自动导引车 (Automated Guided Vehicle) | An automated guided vehicle (AGV) is a portable robot that follows along marked long lines or wires on the floor, or uses radio waves, vision cameras, magnets, or lasers for navigation. AGVs are most often used in industrial applications to transport heavy materials around a large industrial building, such as a factory or warehouse. |  Example: The AGVs in the warehouse transport goods from the receiving dock to the storage area. 仓库里的自动导引车将货物从收货码头运送到存储区。

Example:  The factory uses AGVs to move parts between assembly stations.  这家工厂使用自动导引车在装配站之间运送零件。 | 近义词: autonomous mobile robot (AMR), guided vehicle, self-guided vehicle | 反义词: manual cart, forklift (operated by a person) | 词性: noun
