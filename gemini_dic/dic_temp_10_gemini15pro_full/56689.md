词源: From Old English *dōm "judgment, law, statute; sentence, decree; condition, state; dignity, glory," from Proto-Germanic *dōmaz (source also of Old Saxon dōm "judgment," Old Frisian dōm "choice, judgment," Old Norse dómr "judgment, doom," Dutch doem "cathedral," German  "judgment, Last Judgment," Gothic dōms "judgment"), from PIE root *dhe- "to set, put." The sense of "judicial sentence, condemnation" (mid-13c.) led to that of "fate, destiny" (c. 1300), then "ruin, destruction" (c. 1400).
