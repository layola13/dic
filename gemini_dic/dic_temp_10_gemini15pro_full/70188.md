fibrine:/ˈfaɪbrɪn/| n. |纤维蛋白|An insoluble protein formed from fibrinogen during the clotting of blood. It forms a fibrous mesh that impedes the flow of blood.|例句：Fibrin is essential for blood clotting. 纤维蛋白对于血液凝固至关重要。

例句：The wound was sealed with a mesh of fibrin. 伤口被纤维蛋白网封住了。|近义词：coagulant, clot|反义词: None (Fibrin is a specific protein, not a concept with a direct opposite)|词性:noun
