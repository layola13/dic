ETYMOLOGY->
From French *gazette*, diminutive of *gazzetta* "small coin, newspaper," ultimately from Venetian *gazeta* "newspaper," perhaps from *gazzetta* "magpie" (the bird known for chattering), or from the price of the newspaper. The meaning shifted from "newspaper" to "geographical dictionary" in the 18th century.
