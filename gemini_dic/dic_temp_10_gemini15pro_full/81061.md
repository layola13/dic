grainedness:/ˈɡreɪndnəs/| n. |粒度，颗粒度|The degree to which a material is composed of distinct particles or grains.  It refers to the size and distribution of these particles, impacting the material's texture, appearance, and properties.|The grainedness of the sandpaper determined how smoothly the wood was polished. 砂纸的粒度决定了木材抛光的平滑度。|近义词：granularity, texture, coarseness|反义词: smoothness, fineness|词性:noun

词源: From "grain" + "-ed" + "-ness". "Grain" comes from Old French "grein," ultimately from Latin "granum" (seed, grain). "-ed" forms an adjective indicating possession of a quality, and "-ness" forms a noun from an adjective, denoting a state or quality.
