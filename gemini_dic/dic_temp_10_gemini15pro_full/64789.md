The word "esnecy" is not a recognized English word. It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you intended a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist you.

If you are interested in exploring how new words are formed (neologisms), I can offer some information on that topic.  New words often enter a language through:

* **Derivation:** Creating a new word from an existing one, often by adding prefixes or suffixes (e.g., "unhappy" from "happy").
* **Compounding:** Combining two or more existing words (e.g., "football" from "foot" and "ball").
* **Borrowing:** Taking words from other languages (e.g., "taco" from Spanish).
* **Acronyms:** Forming a word from the initial letters of a phrase (e.g., "laser" from "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation").
* **Back-formation:** Creating a new word by removing what is mistakenly thought to be an affix (e.g., "edit" from "editor").
* **Blending:** Combining parts of two words (e.g., "smog" from "smoke" and "fog").

If "esnecy" was intentionally created, understanding which of these processes was used might help in understanding its intended meaning.
