ETYMOLOGY->
From crank (n.) + -ing.  "Crank" originally referred to a bend or twist, later to a device for converting rotary motion to reciprocating motion (or vice versa), often turned by hand.  The sense of "energetic" or "excellent" is likely a metaphorical extension from the vigorous action of cranking something.
