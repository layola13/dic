ETYMOLOGY->
From ill- + fitting, from fit (v.) + -ing.  "Ill-" acts as a negative prefix, indicating something bad or unsuitable.  The verb "fit" originates from Old English "fitt" meaning "a division, section," later evolving to mean "suitable, appropriate," and then to the modern sense of "to be the right size and shape."
