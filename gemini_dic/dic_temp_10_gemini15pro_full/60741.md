ETYMOLOGY->
From electro- + execution. "Electro-" comes from the Greek word "elektron" meaning "amber," referencing the static electricity observed when amber is rubbed. "Execution" comes from the Latin word "exsequi" meaning "to follow out" or "perform."  The word combines the idea of death being "carried out" by electricity.
