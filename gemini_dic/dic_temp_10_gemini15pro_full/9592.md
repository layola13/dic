ETYMOLOGY->
From anti- (against, opposite) + sophistication (refined taste or manner). The word "sophistication" ultimately comes from the Greek word "sophistēs," meaning "wise man" or "expert."  Initially, "sophistication" had positive connotations, but later acquired negative ones associated with artificiality and deception. "Antisophistication," therefore, represents a rejection of these negative connotations.
