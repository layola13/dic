ETYMOLOGY->
From fist + -i- + cuff + -s.  Fist refers to the closed hand used in punching. Cuff originally referred to a blow with the open hand, but in this context, it reinforces the idea of striking. The -i- is a connecting vowel. The -s indicates a plural form, although fisticuffs is treated as a singular noun.
