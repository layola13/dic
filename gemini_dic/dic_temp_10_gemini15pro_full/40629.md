词源:
From Late Latin conventiculum "meeting," diminutive of conventus "meeting, assembly," from past participle stem of convenire "to come together, assemble," from com- "together" (see com-) + venire "to come" (from PIE root *gwa- "to go, come").  Originally neutral, acquired sense of "secret, unlawful meeting" by 1664 in England, referring specifically to meetings of Nonconformists.
来自晚期拉丁语 conventiculum “会议”，是 conventus “会议，集会”的缩略词，来自 convenire “聚集，集合”的过去分词词干，来自 com- “一起”（参见 com-）+ venire “来”（来自 PIE 词根 *gwa- “去，来”）。最初是中性的，到 1664 年在英国获得了“秘密、非法集会”的含义，特指不墨守成规者的集会。
