PHRASE->

(Since "ele" is a relatively uncommon and informal object pronoun, it doesn't have established common phrases like "what about" or "what if".  It's essentially a shortened form of "him/her/it" and its usage is generally limited to informal spoken contexts.  Therefore, providing phrases is not applicable in this case. It's more practical to focus on understanding its basic grammatical function as an object pronoun.)
