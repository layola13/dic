词源:
From in- + organic.  "In-"  means "not" or "opposite of".  Therefore, inorganic literally means "not organic."  The word "organic" originally referred to substances derived from living organisms.  Later, in chemistry, it came to specifically refer to carbon-containing compounds (with a few exceptions).
