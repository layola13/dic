PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Outbabble" is generally not used in set phrases.  It's more of a descriptive verb used in specific contexts.


词源:  "out-" (prefix meaning "more than" or "exceeding") + "babble" (verb meaning "to talk rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way").  The word is a fairly recent addition to the English language and is not as common as other verbs of speaking.
