Etymology: From carbazole + -otic. Carbazole is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. The "-otic" suffix means "pertaining to" or "derived from".  Ultimately derived from "carbon" and "azole" (a class of five-membered heterocyclic compounds containing a nitrogen atom and at least one other non-carbon atom).
