注意事项:

This word is more common in legal or formal contexts.  In everyday conversation, words like "crime" or "offense" are more frequently used.  "Delit" also has specific legal meanings in certain jurisdictions, so its precise meaning can vary. It is derived from the French word "délit", meaning "offense" or "misdemeanor."
