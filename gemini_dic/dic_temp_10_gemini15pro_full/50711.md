dermopterygii: /ˌdɜːrmɒpˈtɛrɪdʒɪˌaɪ/  /ˌdɝːmoʊpˈtɛrɪdʒɪˌaɪ/
noun
皮翼鱼类
A superclass of fishes including the coelacanths and lungfishes, characterized by lobed, fleshy fins.  These fins have bony internal supports and muscles similar to those of tetrapod limbs.
The dermopterygii, though a relatively small group, are of great evolutionary significance as they are believed to be the closest living relatives of tetrapods.
Synonym: Sarcopterygii (sometimes used interchangeably, though technically distinct)
Antonym:  (No direct antonym, could consider Actinopterygii - ray-finned fishes as a contrasting group)
词性: noun
