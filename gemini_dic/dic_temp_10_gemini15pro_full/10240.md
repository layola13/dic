apotactite:/əˈpɒtækˌtaɪt/
noun
接触岩
A metamorphic rock formed by contact metamorphism, specifically by the juxtaposition and cementation of pre-existing rock fragments.
The apotactite formed near the igneous intrusion displayed a fascinating array of colors.  接触岩形成在火成侵入岩附近，呈现出一系列迷人的颜色。
Synonyms: contact rock, hornfels, skarn (sometimes)
Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific rock type.  One could consider rocks formed by other metamorphic processes, like regional metamorphism, as indirect antonyms: e.g., schist, gneiss)
n.
