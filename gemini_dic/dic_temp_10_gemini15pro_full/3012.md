近义词:  aeriferous tissue
反义词: (No direct antonym, but could consider compact tissue)
词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek ἀήρ (aḗr, “air”) + ἔγχυμα (énchyma, “infusion, injection”), from ἐγχεῖν (enchein, “to pour in”).


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Aerenchyma allows gas exchange between the plant's submerged and aerial parts. = 通气组织允许植物的水下部分和地上部分之间进行气体交换。
Aerenchyma is common in aquatic plants. = 通气组织在水生植物中很常见。


一般过去时:
The researchers discovered that the aerenchyma developed more extensively in flooded conditions. = 研究人员发现，在洪水条件下，通气组织发育得更广泛。
The aerenchyma was examined under a microscope. = 通气组织在显微镜下被检查。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the role of aerenchyma in plant survival. = 科学家们研究了通气组织在植物生存中的作用。
The plant has developed extensive aerenchyma due to prolonged flooding. = 由于长时间的洪水，该植物已经形成了广泛的通气组织。


过去完成时:
The plant had developed aerenchyma before the floodwaters receded. = 在洪水退去之前，植物已经形成了通气组织。
Researchers had identified the aerenchyma tissue before conducting further experiments. = 在进行进一步的实验之前，研究人员已经识别出了通气组织。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the genetic basis of aerenchyma formation. = 进一步的研究将探讨通气组织形成的遗传基础。
Climate change will likely impact the development of aerenchyma in plants. = 气候变化可能会影响植物中通气组织的发育。


虚拟语气:
If the plant lacked aerenchyma, it would not survive in waterlogged soil. = 如果植物缺乏通气组织，它就无法在涝渍的土壤中生存。
If scientists could manipulate aerenchyma development, they might be able to improve crop tolerance to flooding. = 如果科学家能够操纵通气组织的发育，他们或许能够提高作物对洪水的耐受性。


被动语态:
Aerenchyma is formed by the separation of cells. = 通气组织是由细胞分离形成的。
The importance of aerenchyma in aquatic plants is widely recognized. = 通气组织在水生植物中的重要性得到了广泛认可。


疑问句:
What is the function of aerenchyma in plants? = 通气组织在植物中的功能是什么？
How does aerenchyma develop in response to flooding? = 通气组织如何响应洪水而发育？


否定句:
The plant does not have aerenchyma in its leaves. = 植物的叶子中没有通气组织。
The researchers did not observe any aerenchyma in the control group. = 研究人员在对照组中没有观察到任何通气组织。


PHRASE->
the development of aerenchyma = 通气组织的发育
the formation of aerenchyma = 通气组织的形成
the role of aerenchyma = 通气组织的作用
the structure of aerenchyma = 通气组织的结构
aerenchyma tissue = 通气组织
