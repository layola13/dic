bleynte:  (This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.)

Since "bleynte" isn't a recognized word, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. However, if you encountered this word somewhere, it might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "blighted," "blinded," or "blended."  Could you double-check the source?

2. **A neologism/newly coined word:** If it's a new word, its meaning would depend on the context where you found it. Can you provide more information about the source?

3. **A technical term or jargon:** It might be specific to a particular field or community.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **A proper noun/name:**  It could be a person's name, a place name, or a product name.

If you can provide more context, I may be able to offer more specific assistance.
