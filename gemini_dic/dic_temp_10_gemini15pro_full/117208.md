ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *mete*, from Old English *mete* (“food, meat, dish”), from Proto-Germanic *matjan* (“food”), from Proto-Indo-European *mad* (“moist, wet”).  The original meaning included any kind of food, not just the flesh of animals.  The narrowing of the meaning to refer specifically to animal flesh occurred later.
