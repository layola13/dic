词源: From Old French *embraser, from en- + braser "to burn," from Late Latin brasa "burning coals," of uncertain origin. The architectural sense emerged in the 16th century, influenced by the notion of a widening opening.  来自古法语 *embraser，由 en- + braser “燃烧”组成，源自晚期拉丁语 brasa “燃烧的煤”，起源不确定。建筑意义出现在16世纪，受开口加宽的概念的影响。
