ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + commissioned.  "Commissioned" comes from the Old French "comission" meaning "sending, mission, task," which in turn derives from the Latin "commissio," "committing, entrusting," related to the verb "committere" "to unite, combine, join; commit, entrust."  The prefix "non-" simply negates the meaning, indicating the absence of a commission.
