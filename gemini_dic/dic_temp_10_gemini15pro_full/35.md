ETYMOLOGY->
A-OK originated in the early days of the American space program in the 1960s.  It's believed to have stemmed from the meticulous pre-launch checklists, where engineers would confirm each step with "A-OK," possibly signifying "absolutely okay" or a play on "A1," another term for top-notch condition. It quickly entered popular usage after being used in media coverage of the space missions.


USAGE->
A-OK is typically used as an adjective predicative or following a linking verb like "be," "seem," or "appear."

Example 1:
Everything is A-OK. = 一切都很好。

Example 2:

2. running A-OK = 运行良好

4. feeling A-OK = 感觉良好
