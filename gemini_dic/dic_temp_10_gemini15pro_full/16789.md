婆罗摩笈多一世，婆罗摩笈多二世，或婆罗摩笈多的公式/引理
Bhaskara refers to either of two Indian mathematicians, Bhaskara I (c. 600 – c. 680 CE) or Bhaskara II (c. 1114 – 1185 CE).  It can also refer to Bhaskara's Formula/Lemma, a mathematical concept related to solving quadratic equations, often attributed to Bhaskara II.
Bhaskara I is known for his commentary on Aryabhata's work. Bhaskara II is best known for his work Lilavati, which covers topics such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.  Bhaskara's Lemma is a useful tool in number theory.
Bhaskara II's Lilavati is considered a classic text in Indian mathematics.  婆罗摩笈多二世的《丽罗娃蒂》被认为是印度数学的经典著作。

Bhaskara I made significant contributions to the understanding of astronomy. 婆罗摩笈多一世对天文学的理解做出了重大贡献。
