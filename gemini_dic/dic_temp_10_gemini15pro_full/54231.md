From dis- (prefix meaning "reversal or removal") + furnish + -ment (suffix forming nouns of action or process).  The word "furnish" comes from Old French "furniss-" (stem of furnir "to furnish, equip"), from Frankish *frumjan "to provide, perform," from Proto-Germanic *frumjanan "to perform, accomplish," from PIE *pro- "forth" + *bheudh- "to be aware, make aware."
