ETYMOLOGY->
From ivory tower + -ish.  "Ivory tower" itself comes from the French "tour d'ivoire," referencing a place of seclusion or retreat for artists and scholars, often with a connotation of being out of touch with reality.  The term gained popularity after Sainte-Beuve used it to describe the poet Alfred de Vigny.
