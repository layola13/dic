词源:  From Latin *alcyon, from Ancient Greek ἀλκυών (alkuṓn, “kingfisher; halcyon”). The word entered English via Middle French alcion.  The mythical halcyon was a bird, usually identified with the kingfisher, that was said to nest on the sea and calm the waves for a period of 14 days around the winter solstice.
