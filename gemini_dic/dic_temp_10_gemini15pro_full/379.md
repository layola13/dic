It refers to a characteristic or attribute of a particular ability. | The ability's impact on her life was profound.  这个能力对她的生活产生了深远的影响。|  power, capacity, competence, faculty, skill | inability, weakness, incompetence | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *abilite*, from Old French *ableté*, from Latin *habilitās* (“aptitude, ability, skill”), from *habilis* (“apt, fit, suitable”), from *habeō* (“to have, hold”).

USAGE->
It's important to note that the possessive form "ability's" is less common than using "of" to show possession when referring to abstract nouns. For instance, "the impact of the ability" is often preferred over "the ability's impact."  However, "ability's" is still grammatically correct and can be used for stylistic purposes, especially when the phrase is short and using "of" would sound clunky.

Example with possessive pronoun:  Its ability's effectiveness is questionable. =  它的能力的有效性值得怀疑。

Example with descriptive adjective: Her artistic ability's influence on her work is evident. = 她艺术才能对她的作品的影响是显而易见的。
