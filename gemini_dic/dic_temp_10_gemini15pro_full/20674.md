ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *blæc "dark," from Proto-Germanic *blakaz "burned" (source also of Old Norse blakkr "dark," Old High German blah "black," Swedish bläck "ink"), from PIE root *bhleg- "to burn, gleam, shine, flash." The sense development likely went from "burned" to "darkened by burning" to "dark."
