gynaecophore:/ˌɡaɪnɪˈkəfɔːr/
|n.|雌性生殖器载体；雌雄同体生物的雌性生殖枝|A stalk-like or other outgrowth from the male of certain invertebrates that carries fertilized eggs.  It is a specialized structure found in some invertebrates, particularly certain groups of flatworms (Platyhelminthes), that serves to hold and transport fertilized eggs.|The male schistosome has a gynaecophore in which the slender female resides.|Synonym:  egg carrier (less specific)|Antonym: N/A
