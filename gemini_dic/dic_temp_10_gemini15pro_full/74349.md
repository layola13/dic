词源:
From the verb "fragrance" + "-ed" (suffix forming adjectives).  "Fragrance" comes from Old French "fragrance" (modern French "fragrance"), from Latin "fragrantia" meaning "sweet smell," from "fragrans," present participle of "fragrare" meaning "to emit a sweet smell." Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*bhreg-" meaning "to shine, gleam, shimmer."  The connection likely arose from the association of pleasant smells with purity and light.
