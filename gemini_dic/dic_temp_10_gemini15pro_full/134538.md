nonlinear:/ˌnɒnˈlɪnɪə(r)/ (US) /ˌnɑːnˈlɪniər/| adj.|非线性的|Not linear; not denoting, involving, or arranged in a straight line.  Relating to or denoting a system whose output is not directly proportional to its input.|The graph shows a nonlinear relationship between the two variables.|近义词：non-linear, curvilinear, crooked|反义词：linear, straight|词性:形容词
ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + linear.  "Linear" comes from Late Latin "linearis" meaning "of or pertaining to a line," from Latin "linea" meaning "line, string."  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not."
