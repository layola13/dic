例句：She's a popular television hostess. 她是一位受欢迎的电视女主持人。|近义词：host, server, waitress (in a restaurant context)|反义词:guest|Noun

hostessed: This word is not standard English. It seems to be a misspelling or a mistaken attempt to create a past tense or past participle form of "hostess."  "Hostess" itself functions as both a noun and a verb.  As a verb, the past tense is "hosted."
