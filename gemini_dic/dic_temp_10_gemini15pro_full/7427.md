ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *animositee*, borrowed from Old French *animosite*, and ultimately from Latin *animositas* ("spiritedness, vehemence"),  from *animosus* ("spirited, full of courage; passionate, vehement"), from *animus* ("mind, soul, spirit"). The meaning shifted from "spiritedness" to "hostility" over time.
