The word "exauthoration" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  Perhaps you meant "exacerbation," "exhaustion," or "exhortation?"  If you can clarify the intended word, I can provide the requested analysis.

If you're certain about "exauthoration" and its intended meaning, please provide a definition and context so I can attempt an analysis.
