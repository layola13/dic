homomorphism:/ˌhɒməˈmɔːfɪzəm/ (US) /ˌhoʊməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同态|A mapping between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces) that preserves the operations of the structures.  In simpler terms, it's a structure-preserving map between two similar structures.|The homomorphism between the two groups preserved the group operation.  这两个群之间的同态保留了群运算。|isomorphism, morphism|antonym: N/A (The concept of an "opposite" of a homomorphism isn't well-defined.)|noun
