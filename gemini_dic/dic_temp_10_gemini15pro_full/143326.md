词源:  "outecho" is a compound word formed from "out" and "echo". "Out" indicates outward movement or direction, while "echo" refers to a reflected sound or repetition.  Therefore, "outecho" suggests a response or output that is produced as a result of an input or action.

用法说明: "Outecho" can be used as a noun to describe the output or response of a system, process, or individual. It often implies a direct relationship between the input and the output, similar to an echo.
