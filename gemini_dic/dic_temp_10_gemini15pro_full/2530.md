ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *amiral, from Medieval Arabic *ʾamīr-al- (أمير الـ), meaning "commander of the," where the second element varies according to what the commander commands (e.g. *ʾamīr-al-baḥr "commander of the sea").  Ultimately from Arabic amīr (أمير, "commander") + al (الـ, "the"). The initial 'd' in English results from a popular etymology associating the word with Latin admirari.
