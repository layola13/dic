词源: From clerk (n.), from Old French clerc "cleric, clergyman, scholar," from Late Latin clericus "clergyman," from Greek klerikos "of the clergy," from kleros "lot, inheritance, allotted portion," especially one's share of an estate; later, by extension, "office or position in the Church." The sense evolution is from "clergyman" to "scholar" (as the clergy were the literate class) to "one who reads and writes" to "one employed to keep records or accounts."
