词源:  "Aviseful" is a somewhat archaic word formed from "avise" (meaning advice or counsel) + "-ful" (a suffix meaning "full of" or "characterized by").  "Avise" itself comes from Old French "avis," ultimately from Latin "ad" (to) + "visum" (seen), hence "something seen to," "considered," or "advised."
