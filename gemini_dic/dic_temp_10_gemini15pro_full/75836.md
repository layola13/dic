ETYMOLOGY->
From fume + -ish + -ness.  Fume refers to smoke or vapor, but also figuratively to anger or excitement.  The suffix "-ish" adds the sense of "somewhat" or "like," while "-ness" turns it into a noun denoting a state or quality.  Therefore, fumishness literally means the state of being like smoke or vapor, figuratively referring to the irritable and volatile state often associated with hunger or other discomforts.
