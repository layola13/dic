Etymology:
From mawkish + -ly.  Mawkish comes from Middle English *mawke, from Old Norse mathkr "maggot," related to Dutch maag "stomach." The original sense was "nauseating, sickly," referring to the feeling of having maggots in one's stomach. This sense evolved to include disgust or revulsion in general, and later to excessive sentimentality that is perceived as nauseating or insincere.
