词源:  From Old French *ordure, from ord, from Latin horridus (“rough, bristly, shaggy, unkempt; horrid, dreadful”).


注意事项:  Ordure is a formal and somewhat literary word.  It can be considered offensive, especially when referring to human waste.  More common and neutral synonyms are "garbage," "trash," "rubbish," and "waste."
