ETYMOLOGY->
From iso- (Greek: "equal," "same") + cyanic (from "cyanogen," a compound containing carbon and nitrogen).  The term reflects the chemical relationship between isocyanic acid (HNCO) and cyanic acid (HOCN), which are isomers (compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures).
