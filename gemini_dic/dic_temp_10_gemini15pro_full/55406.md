ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin "disterminatio" from Latin "disterminare" (to divide, separate, distinguish, determine) from "dis-" (apart, asunder) + "terminare" (to limit, bound, set bounds to)  ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*terə-" (to cross over, pass through, rub, thresh).  The meaning shifted from "separation" to "destruction" over time.
