macropteres:/ˈmæk.rɒp.tə.riːz/ /ˈmækrəˌptɪriz/ | n. |长翅型，大翅型| Insects or other organisms with unusually large or long wings, especially in comparison to other members of their species.  This term is often used in entomology (the study of insects). | Example:  The macropteres form of the aphid is capable of dispersing over longer distances.  蚜虫的长翅型能够传播到更远的距离。

Example:  Researchers observed a higher proportion of macropteres among the grasshopper population during periods of drought. 研究人员观察到，在干旱时期，蚱蜢种群中长翅型的比例更高。| 近义词:long-winged, alate | 反义词:brachypterous, micropterous | 词性: Noun (plural)

Etymology: From Greek "makros" (large) + "pteron" (wing).
