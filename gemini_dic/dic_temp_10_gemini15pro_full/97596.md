ETYMOLOGY->
From inhabit + -ed + -ness.  Inhabit comes from the Latin inhabitāre, meaning "to dwell in," from in- "in" + habitāre "to dwell."  The suffix -ed forms the past participle of verbs, and in this case creates an adjective meaning "having been inhabited." Finally, -ness is a suffix that forms nouns indicating a state or quality.
