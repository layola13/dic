Etymology: The origin of the name "Idaho" is uncertain. One popular theory suggests it's derived from a Shoshone Native American term meaning "gem of the mountains," though this is disputed.  Another theory proposes it was a made-up name presented to Congress.  Ultimately, the origin remains inconclusive.
