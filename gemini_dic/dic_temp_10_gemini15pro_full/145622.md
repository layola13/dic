overconsolidated: /ˌoʊvərˈkənˈsɑːlɪdeɪtɪd/ | adj. | 过固结的，超固结的 |  Having been subjected to a greater pressure in the past than exists at present, said of a soil or sediment. This usually implies that the soil has a lower void ratio and higher strength than normally consolidated soils under the same effective stress. | The overconsolidated clay exhibited a steeper stress-strain curve. 过固结粘土表现出更陡峭的应力应变曲线。 | The foundation was built on overconsolidated ground, providing excellent stability.  地基建在过固结的地面上，提供了极好的稳定性。 | 近义词: preconsolidated | 反义词: normally consolidated | 词性: adjective

词源: over- (prefix meaning "excessive" or "beyond") + consolidate (verb meaning "to make or become stronger and more solid")
