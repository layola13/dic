ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + conceive (to form an idea or opinion).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", from Proto-Indo-European "*mei- (1)" (to change, go, move).  "Conceive" comes from Old French "conceveir" (to conceive, become pregnant), from Latin "concipere" (to take in, conceive, become pregnant), from "com-" (together, with) + "capere" (to take, seize).
