PHRASE->

(Harrowment is typically not used in phrases. It's more commonly used in formal contexts to describe deep distress or torment.)


注意事项:  Harrowment is a less common word than its adjective form, harrowing.  While both relate to distress, harrowment refers to the *state* of being distressed, while harrowing describes something *causing* distress.
