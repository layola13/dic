词源:

"oking" is a present participle form of the verb "oke," which is an archaic or dialectal form of "smoke."  It comes from the Middle English word "oken" and ultimately from the Old English word "āc" which meant "oak."  Oak wood was commonly used for fires, hence the connection to smoke.

用法说明:

"Oking" is an adjective used to describe something that is emitting smoke, often as a result of burning. While less common than "smoking," it can be used for a more poetic or evocative effect.
