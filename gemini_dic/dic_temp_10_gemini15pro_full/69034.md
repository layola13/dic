Etymology:
From Latin *fatuus* "foolish, insipid, silly,"  related to *fari* "to speak," from PIE root *bha- (2)* "to speak, tell, say."  Originally meant "inspired by a god, oracular," but the sense deteriorated through "prophetic," to "foolish, silly," perhaps from the oracular pronouncements of divinely inspired persons seeming foolish to others.
