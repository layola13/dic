misgiving:/ˌmɪsˈɡɪvɪŋ/
Etymology:  From mis- + giving.  "Mis-" is a prefix of negative or pejorative force. "Giving" in this context refers to the act of attributing something (like trust or confidence) to something else.  So, a misgiving is literally a "mis-placed giving" of trust or confidence.
词源：来自 mis- + giving。“Mis-”是一个表示否定或贬义的前缀。“Giving”在此语境中指的是将某物（如信任或信心）归于另一事物。因此，misgiving 字面意思是“ misplaced giving” of trust or confidence.
