The word "nonoilier" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "non-oiler,"  I can offer a possible interpretation and analysis based on that assumption.


non-oiler:/nɒnˈɔɪlər/ | adj. | 非加油的，不加油的 |  Something that doesn't require oil or doesn't use oil.  This is a descriptive term created by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning not) with the word "oiler." | Example:  This new lawnmower is a non-oiler, which is great for the environment. 这款新的割草机是不需要加油的，这对环境很好。 | Example:  They developed a non-oiler engine that runs on compressed air. 他们开发了一种使用压缩空气的非加油发动机。 | Near Synonyms: oilless, self-lubricating | Antonyms: oil-based, oil-dependent | Word Type: Adjective
