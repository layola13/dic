Etymology:
From Middle English *bismer, likely from Old Norse *bysmr ("confusion, bewilderment").  While not directly attested in Old Norse, the form is reconstructed based on related Scandinavian words like Icelandic *bysmr ("confusion").  The connection to shame or disgrace seen in some related words is less likely in this case.
