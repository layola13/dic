overprecisions: /ˌoʊvərprɪˈsɪʒənz/ | n. | 过度精确; 过度细致 |  The state of being excessively precise, often to the point of being impractical or unnecessary.  It implies an undue focus on minute details that may not significantly impact the overall outcome. | His overprecisions in measuring ingredients made baking a simple cake a three-hour ordeal.  他测量配料的过度精确使得烤一个简单的蛋糕变成了一场三小时的煎熬。 |  over-scrupulousness, meticulousness, fastidiousness |  imprecision, carelessness, approximation | noun

Etymology: "over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *ubar "over, above") + "precision" (from Old French precision, from Latin praecisio "a cutting off in front," from praecisus, past participle of praecidere "to cut off in front," from prae "before" + caedere "to cut").
