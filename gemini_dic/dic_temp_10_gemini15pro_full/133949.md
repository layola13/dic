PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Nonhectically" is not typically used in set phrases. Its meaning is quite specific and it's more commonly integrated directly into sentences to describe the manner in which something is done. 


词源:
"Nonhectically" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "hectic" and the adverbial suffix "-ly". "Hectic" comes from the Greek word "hektikos," meaning "habitual," and later acquired the sense of "feverish" or "agitated."  Therefore, "nonhectically" describes an action done without the agitation or rush implied by "hectic."
