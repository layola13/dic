词源:  The word "gremlin" is of relatively recent origin, first appearing in the early 20th century in Royal Air Force slang.  While the exact etymology is uncertain, it's thought to derive from a combination of "goblin" and perhaps "grim." It gained popularity during World War II, when pilots often blamed mechanical problems on these mischievous creatures.  Although initially associated with aircraft malfunctions, the term has broadened to encompass any unexplained technical problem.
