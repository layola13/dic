ETYMOLOGY->

From "ham," slang for an overactor, likely originating in the late 19th century, possibly from the song "The Ham-fat Man," which was popular with minstrel performers, who were often considered overly theatrical.  The "-ness" suffix turns the noun "ham" into the abstract noun "hamminess," denoting the quality of being a ham actor. The additional "'s" makes it possessive.
