词源：Old English dēor "animal, beast," from Proto-Germanic *diusam "wild animal" (source also of Old Saxon dior, Old High German tior, Old Norse dýr, Dutch dier, German Tier "animal"), from PIE root *dheus-/*dheusom "wild animal; to breathe, exhale." In Old English, generally used of four-footed wild animals, especially mammals; later, domesticated animals were called neat.  Replaced by animal (from Old French) except in compounds such as reindeer.
