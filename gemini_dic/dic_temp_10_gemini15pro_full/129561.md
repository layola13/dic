词源:  "non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "Catholic" refers to the Roman Catholic Church.  Therefore, "non-Catholics" literally means "not Catholic." The term arises from the historical context of the Catholic Church being the dominant Christian denomination in many parts of the world, leading to the distinction between those within and outside of its membership.
