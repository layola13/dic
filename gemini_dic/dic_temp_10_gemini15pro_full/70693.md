The finalizer will be releasing resources during the shutdown process. = 在关闭过程中，终结器将释放资源。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the time the program finishes, the finalizer will have executed. = 当程序完成时，终结器将已经执行。
The finalizer will have released all resources before the program terminates. = 在程序终止之前，终结器将已经释放所有资源。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
