PHRASE->

There is no common phrase using "chamat" as it's not a standard English word. It's likely a loanword or a dialectical term, possibly originating from a language like Hindi or Urdu where it carries the meaning described above.  Therefore, providing phrases in English wouldn't be accurate or helpful in understanding its usage within its original context.


词源： "Chamat" likely originates from Hindi or Urdu, where it carries the meaning of shame, humiliation, or embarrassment. It might be related to the Arabic word "شَمَاتَة" (shamātah), which refers to gloating or rejoicing at the misfortune of others, but in Hindi/Urdu, the meaning has shifted to focus more on the feeling of shame experienced by the person who has suffered the misfortune.
