hyperchromatism:/ˌhaɪpərˈkrəʊmətɪzəm/ | n. | 增色性，深染性 | An increase in the absorption of ultraviolet light by a biological molecule, typically DNA or RNA, often associated with denaturation.  It signifies an increase in absorbance at a specific wavelength of light, often 260 nm for DNA and RNA, due to a disruption of the ordered structure of the nucleic acid. |  The hyperchromatism observed upon heating the DNA indicated denaturation.  加热DNA后观察到的增色性表明发生了变性。

The hyperchromatism of the sample suggests that the RNA has been degraded. 样品的增色性表明RNA已经降解。 | 近义词: hyperchromicity | 反义词: hypochromism | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From hyper- (Greek: 'over, excessive') + chroma (Greek: 'color') + -ism (suffix forming nouns of state or condition).
