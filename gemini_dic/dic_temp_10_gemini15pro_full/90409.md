注意事项:

"How've" is informal and primarily used in spoken English.  Avoid using it in formal writing.  It's always a contraction of "how have."  Since it's always related to the perfect tenses, its usage is restricted to those contexts.  In many cases, simply using "How have you..." is more appropriate, even in spoken English.
