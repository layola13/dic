词源:
From customize + -able.  Customize itself comes from custom + -ize.  Ultimately from Old French *coustume* (modern French *coutume*) "custom, habit," from Latin *consuetudo* "custom, habit, usage, intimacy, acquaintance," from *consuetus*, past participle of *consuescere* "to accustom," from *com-* "together" (see com-) + *suescere* "to become accustomed," related to *suus* "one's own."
