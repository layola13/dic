ETYMOLOGY->
From French *commode*, from Latin *commodus* "suitable, convenient," from *com-* "together" + *modus* "measure, manner."  The original meaning referred to a convenient piece of furniture. The later sense of "toilet" arose because of the convenience of chamber pots being enclosed in such furniture.
