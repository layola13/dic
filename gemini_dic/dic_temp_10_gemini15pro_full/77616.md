geff:/ɡɛf/| n.|有效质量|The effective mass of an electron in a solid is a quantity that is used to describe the behavior of the electron in a crystal lattice. It takes into account the interactions of the electron with the periodic potential of the crystal.  固体中电子的有效质量是用来描述电子在晶格中行为的物理量。它考虑了电子与晶体周期性势的相互作用。|The electron's geff in this material is higher than expected.  这种材料中电子的有效质量比预期的要高。|近义词:effective mass|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "bare mass" in specific physics contexts)|词性: noun (abbreviation)


Etymology:
geff is derived from "**g**eneralized **eff**ective mass". It is a shorthand notation frequently encountered in solid-state physics and materials science.  geff 源自“广义有效质量”。它是固态物理和材料科学中常见的简写符号。
