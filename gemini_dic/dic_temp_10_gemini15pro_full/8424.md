注意事项:
"Anti-Zionism" can sometimes be conflated with antisemitism (hostility to or prejudice against Jewish people). While some anti-Zionists may also be antisemitic, the two are not synonymous. It's important to distinguish between criticizing the political ideology of Zionism and expressing prejudice against Jewish people.
