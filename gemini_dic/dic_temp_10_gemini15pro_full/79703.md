glucic: /ˈɡluːsɪk/ | adj. |  葡萄糖的，血糖的 | Relating to glucose or blood sugar.  Derived from "glucose" with the suffix "-ic" indicating relation or derivation. | The glucic index measures how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels.  血糖指数衡量食物升高血糖水平的速度。| Synonyms: glycemic | Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider terms related to low blood sugar like "hypoglycemic") | adjective

PHRASE->
glucic index = 血糖指数
glucic control = 血糖控制
glucic response = 血糖反应
glucic load = 血糖负荷
glucic metabolism =  血糖代谢


注意事项:
This word, "glucic," while technically correct in its formation, is not commonly used in medical or scientific literature. "Glycemic" is the standard and preferred term.  While all the examples are grammatically correct and demonstrate the requested structures, it's highly recommended to use "glycemic" in real-world communication.
