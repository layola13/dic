illocality:/ɪˌloʊˈkælɪti/
n.
非定域性，非局域性
The concept of illocality in quantum physics suggests that two entangled particles can instantaneously affect each other, regardless of the distance separating them.
量子物理学中的非定域性概念表明，两个纠缠的粒子可以瞬间相互影响，而不管它们之间的距离如何。
近义词：nonlocality, non-localness
反义词：locality, localness
词性：名词

Etymology:
From in- (not) + locality.  "Locality" comes from Late Latin localitas, from Latin locus (place).
