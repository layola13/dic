aromaticity:/ˌærəməˈtɪsəti/ | n. | 芳香性 | The property of a cyclic (ring-shaped), planar (flat) molecule with a ring of resonance bonds that exhibits more stability than conjugated or single bonds.| Benzene exhibits aromaticity due to its delocalized pi electrons. | 苯由于其离域的π电子而表现出芳香性。 |  近义词: resonance, conjugation | 反义词: antiaromaticity, nonaromaticity | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From aroma + -icity.  "Aroma" ultimately derives from the Greek word ἄρωμα (arōma), meaning "spice" or "sweet smell."  "-icity" is a suffix used to form nouns indicating a state or quality.
