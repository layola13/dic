ETYMOLOGY->
From mongrelize (v.) + -ation (suffix forming nouns of action or process).
Mongrelize comes from mongrel (n. & adj.), denoting an animal of mixed breed, often with connotations of inferiority.  The term's origins are uncertain, but it may be related to the Old English *mang, meaning "mixture."  The suffix "-ize" transforms the noun into a verb meaning "to make or become mongrel," and "-ation" creates the noun form denoting the act or process of mongrelizing.
