dropstone:/ˈdrɒpˌstəʊn/ (UK) /ˈdrɑːpˌstoʊn/ (US)| n. |落石；坠石|A rock transported by ice (glacier or iceberg) and deposited into finer-grained sediments.  It indicates that the area was once covered by ice. |The geologist found a dropstone in the sedimentary layer, evidence of past glaciation.  地质学家在沉积层中发现了一块落石，这是过去冰川作用的证据。

The presence of dropstones in the marine sediments suggests icebergs once floated here. 海洋沉积物中落石的存在表明这里曾经漂浮着冰山。|近义词：erratic, glacial erratic|反义词: (No direct antonym exists, as it's a specific geological term)|词性:noun
