注意事项:
"Lingel" is not a common English word.  "Bell" or "doorbell" are much more frequently used.  While "lingel" is technically a valid word (derived from German), its usage is rare and might not be understood by all English speakers.  Using "bell" or "doorbell" is recommended for clear communication.
