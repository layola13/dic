capillarity:/ˌkæpɪˈlærɪti/| n.|毛细作用，毛细现象|The ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity.  This is due to the combination of surface tension and adhesive forces between the liquid and the surrounding material.|The capillarity of the soil helps bring water to the surface. 土壤的毛细作用有助于将水带到地表。|Synonyms: capillary action, capillary motion, wicking|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but concepts like hydrophobicity or non-wetting describe the opposite effect)|noun
