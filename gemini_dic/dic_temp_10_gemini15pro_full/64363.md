注意事項:

"erbiums" itself is not commonly used. The singular form "erbium" is typically sufficient even when referring to multiple atoms or ions of the element.  The provided examples using "erbiums" are for illustrative purposes of grammatical structures only.  In scientific and technical contexts, "erbium" is the preferred term.
