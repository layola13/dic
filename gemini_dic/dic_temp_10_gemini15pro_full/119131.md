词源:
"Metrosexual" is a portmanteau of "metropolitan" and "sexual," coined in 1994 by British journalist Mark Simpson.  "Metrosexualities" is the plural form, referring to the diverse expressions and characteristics associated with this concept.  "Metropolitan" refers to a large, cosmopolitan city, suggesting the urban and sophisticated nature often associated with metrosexuality. "Sexual" refers to aspects of appearance and grooming that are traditionally associated with a concern for one's attractiveness.
