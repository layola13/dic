likerousness:/ˈlaɪkərəsnəs/
noun
可爱;讨人喜欢;美好
The quality of being pleasant or attractive.
Her likerousness charmed everyone in the room. 她的可爱迷住了房间里的每个人。
近义词: loveliness, charm, appeal, attractiveness
反义词: unpleasantness, repulsiveness, unattractiveness
词性: 名词


词源:  Likely derived from "like" (meaning "pleasing") + "-er" (comparative suffix, though not used comparatively here) + "-ness" (noun-forming suffix).  Essentially, it amplifies the sense of "likeability" into a more pronounced and perhaps slightly old-fashioned quality.
