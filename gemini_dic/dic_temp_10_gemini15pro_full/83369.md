ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *giron (Modern French giron), "lap," from Frankish *giro, "circle," from Proto-Germanic *geiraz.  Related to Old English gyran, "to turn," and ultimately to the PIE root *geiros, "bent, curved." The heraldic sense developed from the idea of a triangular piece of cloth cut from a circular garment.
