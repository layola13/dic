ionizations:/ˌaɪənɪˈzeɪʃənz/| n.|电离，离子化|The process by which an atom or molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons, often in conjunction with other chemical changes.|The ionization of the gas created a plasma.  气体的电离产生了等离子体。|
Ionizations of water molecules create hydroxide and hydronium ions. 水分子的电离产生了氢氧根离子和水合氢离子。|synonyms: charging, electrification|antonyms: neutralization, deionization|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From ionize + -ation.  Ionize comes from ion + -ize. Ion comes from the Greek "ion" (going), present participle of "ienai" (to go), because in electrolysis, ions "go" towards one of the electrodes.
