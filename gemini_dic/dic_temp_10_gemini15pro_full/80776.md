ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *gossiprie*, from Old English *godsibb* (sponsor, godparent) + *-ræden* (condition, state, office). The original meaning referred to close friends or companions, particularly women who attended a birth. Over time, the term evolved to encompass idle chatter and eventually took on its negative connotation of spreading rumors.
