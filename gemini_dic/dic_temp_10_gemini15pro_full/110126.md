词源:
From Middle English *liden, from Old English *līðen, from Proto-Germanic *līþanaz (“loathsome, evil”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)leydʰ- (“slimy, slippery, bad”).  Cognate with Old High German līdan (“bad, evil”). Related to Old English līðe (“gentle, mild”).  The semantic shift from “slimy” to “disgusting” is common in many languages.
