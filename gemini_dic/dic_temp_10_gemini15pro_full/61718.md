Etymology:  From emotion + -alism,  "emotion" from French émotion (16c.), from Old French emouvoir "stir up," from Latin emovere "move out, remove; stir up, excite," from ex- "out" (see ex-) + movere "to move" (from PIE root *meue- "to push away").  "-alism" is a suffix forming nouns meaning "action or practice of," "doctrine of," "devotion to," from French -isme and directly from Latin -ismus (from Greek -ismos).
