词源: "Nocument" appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) likely formed by combining "no" (meaning not or without) and "document" (referring to official paperwork). It suggests the lack of official documentation or registration.  It's not a widely recognized word.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context would help in confirming its intended meaning.
