PHRASE->
would like to = 想要
like to do something = 喜欢做某事
like to + verb = 喜欢…
liked to have + past participle (Expresses a past unrealized hope or desire)  =  差点…;  险些…;  本来想…
would have liked to + verb  = 本来想…


注意事项:
"Like to" is generally used for habitual actions or preferences. For specific instances, "like + -ing" is often preferred.  For example, "I like swimming" (general preference) vs. "I'm liking this swimming pool" (specific instance, although less common).  Using "like to" in continuous tenses is grammatically correct but less common.
