PHRASE->
Since "fragical" isn't a standard word, it doesn't have established phrases.  However, if one were to use it creatively, perhaps mimicking existing phrases with "fragile," one could imagine constructions like:

*  Handle with fragical care.  小心轻放(带有悲剧色彩)
*  A fragical situation.  一个脆弱的(易导致悲剧的)局面
*  The fragical ecosystem.  脆弱的(易崩溃的)生态系统
*  Fragical beauty.  易逝的美丽
*  A fragical peace.  脆弱的和平


注意事项:

As repeatedly noted, "fragical" isn't a recognized English word.  While understandable as a blend of "fragile" and "tragical," using it in formal or professional contexts would likely be confusing or appear as a mistake.  Stick to standard vocabulary like "fragile," "delicate," "precarious," or "vulnerable," and express the potential for tragedy through other means.
