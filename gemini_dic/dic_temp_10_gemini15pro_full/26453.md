词源：From Ancient Greek byssos ("fine linen") + -oid ("resembling").  Byssus originally referred to a fine, valuable cloth made from the silky filaments secreted by certain Mediterranean bivalve mollusks (specifically Pinna nobilis).  The term was later extended to refer to the filaments themselves, and then by extension to any similar cottony or filamentous substance.
