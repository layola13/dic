ETYMOLOGY->
"Doom" comes from Old English "dōm" meaning "judgment, law, statute, sentence, decree."  It evolved to mean a negative judgment or fate.
"Gloom" comes from Old English "glōm"  meaning "twilight, dusk."  It developed into a sense of darkness and depression.  The phrase "doom and gloom" combines these two words to create a stronger sense of negativity and pessimism.
