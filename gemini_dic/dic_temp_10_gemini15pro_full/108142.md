注意事项:  "Latino/a" can be a sensitive term and its usage can vary depending on context and personal preference.  Some individuals prefer to be identified by their specific country of origin (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, Colombian).  It's always best to be respectful and ask how someone prefers to be identified.  Additionally, while "Latino" is often used as a gender-neutral term, some argue that it is inherently masculine.  "Latinx" is a more recent term that has emerged as a gender-neutral alternative, though it's not universally accepted.
