meitnerium:/ˌmaɪtˈnɪəriəm/| n. |钅麦|A synthetic radioactive element with the symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It is an extremely radioactive metal, and all of its isotopes are very short-lived. |Meitnerium is named after Lise Meitner, a physicist who contributed significantly to the discovery of nuclear fission.|There are no practical applications for meitnerium due to its scarcity and short half-life. |近义词: (No synonyms as it's a unique element)|反义词: (No antonyms for chemical elements)
词性:noun
