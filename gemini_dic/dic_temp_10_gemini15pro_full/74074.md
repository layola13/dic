fossilization:/ˌfɒsəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ /ˌfɑːsələˈzeɪʃən/| n.|化石作用，僵化|The fossilization of ancient trees formed petrified wood. 古树的化石作用形成了石化木。|例句：The fossilization process can preserve even delicate structures.  化石化过程甚至可以保存精细的结构。|近义词：petrification, lithification|反义词:decay, decomposition|词性:名词
Etymology: From French *fossilisation*, from *fossiliser* (“to fossilize”), from *fossile* (“fossil”). Ultimately from Latin *fossilis* (“dug up”).
