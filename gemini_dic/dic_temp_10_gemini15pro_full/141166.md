ooespore: /ˈoʊəˌspɔːr/ | n. | 卵孢子 | A thick-walled sexual spore formed in some algae and fungi, specifically in the Oomycetes. | Example: The ooespore is crucial for the survival of the Phytophthora infestans, the organism that causes potato blight. 卵孢子对于致病疫霉的生存至关重要，这种生物会导致马铃薯枯萎病。

Example:  Researchers studied the germination of ooespores under various environmental conditions. 研究人员研究了不同环境条件下卵孢子的萌发。 | Near synonyms:  zygote, sexual spore | Antonyms:  zoospore, asexual spore | noun
