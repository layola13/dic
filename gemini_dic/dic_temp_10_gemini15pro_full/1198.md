ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *accolade* (meaning "embrace, kiss of greeting"), from *accoller* "to embrace around the neck," from *a-* (ad-) "to" + *col* "neck" (from Latin *collum*).  The sense shifted from "embrace" to "ceremony of conferring knighthood" (which involved an embrace), and then to "any mark of acknowledgment or award."
