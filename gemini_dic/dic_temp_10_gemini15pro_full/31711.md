注意事项:

“Chawal” itself is not a standard English word.  It's a Hindi/Urdu word borrowed into English by speakers of those languages, especially in South Asia.  While understood by many English speakers in the region, it's not universally recognized.  Using "rice" is generally more appropriate in standard English contexts.
