词源：
"Oversorrowfully" is formed by the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively," "too much") and the adjective "sorrowful" (meaning "feeling or expressing sorrow"). "Sorrowful" comes from the Old English "sorhfull," where "sorh" means "sorrow" and "-full" is a suffix indicating abundance or fullness. The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "sorrowful" into the adverb "sorrowfully."  Therefore, "oversorrowfully" literally means "excessively sorrowfully."
