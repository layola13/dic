cristae:/ˈkrɪstiː/
n.
嵴, 嵴内膜
(plural of crista) The folds of the inner membrane of a mitochondrion.
The cristae of the mitochondria are where cellular respiration occurs. 线粒体的嵴是细胞呼吸发生的地方。
synonyms:  inner folds, mitochondrial folds
antonyms:  N/A (lack of cristae would imply a dysfunctional mitochondrion, not a direct opposite)
noun
