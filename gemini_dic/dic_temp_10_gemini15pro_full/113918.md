The word "maegbote" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be an Old English word. After research, I found it might be related to "mægbot" or "magbot," which meant "kinsman-compensation" in Old English.  Since it's archaic, providing modern usage examples and tenses is challenging. I will offer information based on its likely root.

mægbot (maegbote): /ˈmæɡˌboʊt/
mægbot (maegbote):| n. |kinsman-compensation, wergild for a kinsman |A payment made as compensation for the killing of a kinsman.
