词源: From Middle English *litenes, from Old French *liteté, from Latin *litatem (nominative *litas), from *litis (“strife, quarrel, lawsuit”), related to Greek λίσσομαι (líssomai, “I pray, entreat”). More at plea.  -ness added to form the abstract noun.  The additional 's is likely a possessive form, although unusual in this context and might be considered incorrect in formal writing. It could imply the politeness *belonging* to someone or something (e.g., "the politeness's of the staff").
