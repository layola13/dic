Etymology:
From "down" + "pour," literally meaning "a pouring down."  "Down" traces back to Old English "dūn," meaning "from a higher to a lower place." "Pour" comes from Middle English "pouren," likely from Anglo-French "purer," ultimately from Latin "purare" meaning "to purify, cleanse."  The combined meaning evolved to describe a heavy rainfall.
