ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + interest.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of." "Interest" comes from Old French "interest" meaning "damage, loss, detriment," later "concern, importance," from Latin "interesse" meaning "to be of importance, to make a difference." The meaning shifted to "lack of interest" in the 17th century.
