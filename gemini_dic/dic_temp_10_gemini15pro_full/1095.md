注意事项:

While "access's" is grammatically correct as a possessive form, it's often considered awkward and less common than using "access of" or rephrasing the sentence. For instance, "the access of the manager" or "the manager's access" is generally preferred over "the manager's access's."  Using "access's" might be perceived as redundant or overly possessive.  Consider alternative phrasing for smoother and more natural-sounding English.
