词源： "no-gooder" comes from the adjective "no-good" combined with the suffix "-er," which is used to form nouns referring to people who perform a particular action or have a particular characteristic.  "No-good" itself dates back to the late 19th century and is a combination of "no" and "good," meaning "not good" or "worthless."
