词源:
From affection + -less.  "Affection" comes from the Old French word "affection" which in turn comes from the Latin "affectionem" (nominative affectio) meaning "a disposition, inclination, fondness, disease,"  from the past participle stem of afficere "to do something to, influence," from ad- "to" + facere "to do, make."  "-less" is a suffix meaning "without."
