duis:/dʊɪs/ | determiner, pronoun |  (plural) these, those (masculine and feminine plural, ablative case) | "Duis" is a Latin word, specifically a pronoun/determiner in the ablative plural, meaning "from/by/with/in/at these" or "from/by/with/in/at those". It's derived from the demonstrative pronoun "is, ea, id" meaning "this, that".  It indicates the things being referred to are further away (like "those") rather than close (like "these"). Because it's in the ablative case, it shows a relationship of separation, location, instrument, or cause with the rest of the sentence. It's important to remember this word exists only in Latin. |  Duis temporibus, omnia mutantur. (In these/those times, all things change.) |  his, illis (Latin) |  (No direct English antonym as it's a grammatical function word) | pronoun, determiner
