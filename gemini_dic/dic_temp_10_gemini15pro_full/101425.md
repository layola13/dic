注意事项:

While "Persian" can technically refer to an Iranian citizen, it is more accurate to use "Iranian."  "Persian" specifically relates to the Persian ethnicity, which is one of many ethnic groups within Iran.  Using "Persian" to refer to all Iranians can be seen as erasing the diversity of the country and is therefore sometimes considered problematic.  "Irani" exists as a word, but it's far less common than "Iranian."
