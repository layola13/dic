词源:  The origin of "bonk" is uncertain. The sense of "hit" likely comes from imitative origin, mimicking the sound of a blow. The meaning of "exhausted" likely arose in the 1980s among athletes, perhaps related to the feeling of hitting a wall of fatigue. The sexual meaning is more recent and may be a euphemism derived from the sense of hitting.
