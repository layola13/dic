PHRASE->
(Since "krono" is a combining form, it's less likely to have stand-alone phrases.  However, here are some examples within compound words)

chronological order  按时间顺序
chronological age  实际年龄
chronological record  时间记录
chronostratigraphy  年代地层学
chronobiology  时间生物学

注意事项:
As "krono" isn't a fully independent word in common usage (it functions as a combining form), its usage is primarily limited to forming compound words related to time.
