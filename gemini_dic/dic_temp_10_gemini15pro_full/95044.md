inactivations:/ɪnˌæktɪˈveɪʃənz/
|n.|失活，灭活，去活化|The process of making something inactive, or the state of being inactive.  The inactivations of the enzymes were caused by high temperatures.|例句：The researchers studied the inactivations of several key enzymes. 研究人员研究了几种关键酶的失活。

例句：Repeated inactivations of the virus have proven difficult.  反复灭活病毒已被证明很困难。|近义词：deactivations, neutralizations, suppressions|反义词:activations, stimulations|词性:名词
