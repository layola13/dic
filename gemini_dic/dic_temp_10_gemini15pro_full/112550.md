词源：
The surname Lovelace is derived from the Old French phrase "l'oeul de vache," meaning "cow's eye," possibly referring to a personal characteristic or a place name.  When used to denote a type of lace, it doesn't have a separate etymology; it's simply referencing the delicate and intricate nature of the fabric.
