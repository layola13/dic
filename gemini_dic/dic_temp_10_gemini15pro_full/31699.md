ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of "chav" is uncertain, but one popular theory connects it to the Romani word "chavi," meaning "child." This theory suggests that the term initially referred to young Romani people and later became a derogatory label applied to working-class youth. Another theory links it to the Chatham area of Kent, England.
