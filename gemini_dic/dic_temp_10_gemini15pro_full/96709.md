词源:  "ineffectivenesses" comes from "ineffective" + "-ness" + "-es".  "Ineffective" is formed by the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "effective".  "Effective" ultimately derives from the Latin "effectus", meaning "carrying out," from the verb "efficere".  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state or quality, and "-es" creates the plural form.
