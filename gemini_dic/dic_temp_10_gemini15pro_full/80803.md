**Etymology (词源):**

From Gothic + -ly.  "Gothic" itself comes from the Goths, an East Germanic people, via French "Gothique."  Originally used pejoratively to describe the architectural style of the Middle Ages (seen as barbaric by Renaissance thinkers), it later gained wider usage referring to the art, literature, and culture associated with that period and its revival in later centuries.
