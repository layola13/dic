注意事项:

"Fanty" is somewhat archaic and not commonly used in modern English.  More common synonyms would be "frivolous," "flashy," "ostentatious," or "flamboyant."  It can also have slightly negative connotations, suggesting something is excessively showy or lacking in good taste.  Therefore, be mindful of the context when using this word.
