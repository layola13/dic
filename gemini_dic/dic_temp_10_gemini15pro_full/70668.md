PHRASE->
(Generally, "fin's" wouldn't be part of a common set phrase, as it's a relatively informal and specific term.  However, here are some plausible examples using the slang meaning of "hands.")

Get your fin's off that! = 把你的手拿开！
These fin's are freezing! = 我的手冻僵了！
I need to wash my fin's. = 我需要洗手。

注意事项:
Note that "fin's" is not a standard possessive form and might be considered informal or even incorrect in formal writing.  It's more common to use "the fish's fin" or "the fish's fins" when referring to the fins of a single fish, and "the fishes' fins" when referring to the fins of multiple fish.
