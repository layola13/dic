hypergeneticalnesses:/ˌhaɪpərˌdʒɛnˈɛtɪkəlnəsɪz/ | n. | 超遗传性 |  The state or quality of being hypergenetical, referring to processes occurring on the Earth's surface, especially weathering and erosion.  This word is extremely rare and likely coined academically.  It's formed from "hypergenetical" + "-ness". | Example: The hypergeneticalnesses of the exposed rock formations showcased the power of natural weathering processes. 裸露岩层的超遗传性展示了自然风化过程的力量。|  近义词: superficial alteration, weathering processes | 反义词: hypogene processes | 词性: noun
