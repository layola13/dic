The correct spelling is "color" (American English) or "colour" (British English).  I will provide information for both spellings.

**American English:**

color: /ˈkʌlər/ | n. v. | 颜色；染色 | The color of the sky is blue.  天空的颜色是蓝色的。|  hue, shade, tint | achromatic, colorless | noun, verb

**British English:**

colour: /ˈkʌlə(r)/ | n. v. | 颜色；染色 | The colour of the grass is green. 草的颜色是绿色的。| hue, shade, tint | achromatic, colourless | noun, verb

**Etymology:**

Both "color" and "colour" derive from the Old French "colur," which itself comes from the Latin "color."

**English Explanation:**

As a noun, "color/colour" refers to the property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects or emits light.  As a verb, it means to add color to something, often with dye or paint.
