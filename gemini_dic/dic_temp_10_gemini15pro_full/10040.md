aplanatic:/ˌæpləˈnætɪk/
adjective
消球差的，不晕的
Corrected for spherical aberration and coma; free from spherical aberration.
An aplanatic lens system provides a sharper, clearer image by minimizing these distortions.  消球差透镜系统通过最大限度地减少这些畸变，提供更清晰、更锐利的图像。
The telescope uses an aplanatic objective to produce high-quality images. 这台望远镜使用消球差物镜来产生高质量的图像。
近义词:achromatic, corrected
反义词:aberrant, distorted
词性:adjective

Etymology: From a- (not) + Greek planēs (wanderer) + -ic.  The term refers to the correction of aberrations that cause light rays to "wander" from the ideal focal point.
