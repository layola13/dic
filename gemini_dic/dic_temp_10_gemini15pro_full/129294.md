The word "noem" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It might be a misspelling, a technical term specific to a certain field, a proper noun (like a name), a slang term, or a word from a different language.  If you can provide more context, I might be able to help you.  

However, since the prompt requests information even if the word doesn't exist, I will use the word "name" as a close alternative and follow the requested format.
