PHRASE->
N/A (since "al" is a suffix, it doesn't form phrases on its own.)

注意事项:
Since "al" is a suffix, it doesn't have antonyms or synonyms. It modifies other words, and those words would have their own antonyms and synonyms.  Also, as a suffix, it doesn't have its own independent pronunciation.  It changes the pronunciation of the root word it attaches to.
