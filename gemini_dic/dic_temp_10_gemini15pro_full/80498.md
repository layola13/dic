词源：This term is a compound adjective formed from "good" and "for nothing." "Good for" indicates usefulness or suitability for a purpose, while "nothing" signifies a lack of purpose or value.  Therefore, "good-for-nothing" literally means "good for no purpose" or "useful for nothing."  It entered the English language in the late 16th century.
