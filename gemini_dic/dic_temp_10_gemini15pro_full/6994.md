androdiecious:/ænˌdroʊˈdaɪʃəs/
| adj. |雄全异株的|Having male plants and hermaphrodite plants, but no purely female plants.|Androdiecy is a rare breeding system, observed in some plants like *Datisca glomerata*.|This species exhibits androdiecious characteristics, with some plants bearing only male flowers and others having both male and female reproductive structures.| 近义词: gynodioecious (partially synonymous, as both describe systems with mixed sexes, but gynodioecy involves female and hermaphrodite plants)| 反义词: dioecious (having separate male and female plants)
|词性:形容词
