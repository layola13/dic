Etymology:
From "frameable" + "-ness".  "Frameable" comes from "frame" (verb, meaning to put a frame around something) + "-able" (suffix meaning capable of being).  "Frame" ultimately derives from the Old French word "frem", meaning framework. "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns expressing a state or quality.
