The word "compien" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling of "compline," "complain," or perhaps intended as a different word entirely.  I will provide analyses for "compline" and "complain."

Etymology: From Old French *complie*, from Late Latin *complēta (hōra)*, literally "completed (hour)."


**Complain:**

/kəmˈpleɪn/ | v. | 抱怨，投诉 | Express dissatisfaction or annoyance about a state of affairs or an event. | I complained to the manager about the poor service. 我向经理投诉了糟糕的服务。 | synonyms: grumble, protest, object | antonyms: praise, commend, compliment | verb
