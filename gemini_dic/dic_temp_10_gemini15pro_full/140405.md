注意事项:

As explained above, "ois" is not a standalone word in French.  It is always part of a larger word or expression, most commonly relating to the question word "quoi" (what).  Therefore, many of the requested elements like synonyms, antonyms, and examples of different tenses are not applicable directly to "ois" but rather to the words it forms a part of.  The examples provided above demonstrate how "quoi" functions in different contexts.
