kadder:/ˈkædər/| n.| 絮凝物，凝聚物|A flocculent mass, especially one formed in a liquid. |The kadder formed in the solution after the reagent was added.  试剂加入后溶液中形成了絮凝物。|近义词：floccule, coagulum, precipitate|反义词: solution|词性: 名词

词源:  Likely derived from Dutch "kader" meaning "frame" or "framework," suggesting the interconnected structure of a flocculent mass. This is a less certain etymology due to the word's limited usage.
