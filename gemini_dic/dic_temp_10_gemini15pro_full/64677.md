注意事项:
"Escambio" is not a commonly used English word. It is borrowed from Italian and Spanish. "Exchange" is the standard English equivalent. While understandable, using "escambio" in English may sound unusual or overly formal.  It might be suitable in specific contexts, such as discussions about Italian or Hispanic culture, or when referencing a specific organization or program that uses the term.
