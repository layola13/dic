词源:
The word "acouchy" likely originates from a combination of "a-" (meaning "on" or "in" in some contexts) and "couche" (French for "bed" or "couch").  The imagery suggests someone who prefers to stay in their "couch," avoiding social interaction.  However, its etymology is not definitively established in standard dictionaries, and the word is considered somewhat archaic or dialectal.
