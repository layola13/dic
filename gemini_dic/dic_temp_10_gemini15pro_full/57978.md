词源:  "drive-in" is a compound word formed from "drive" and "in". It emerged in the early 20th century in American English, with the first documented use referring to a drive-in bank in the 1930s.  "Drive" signifies arriving and staying in a vehicle, while "in" denotes within or at a location. This combination conveys the concept of a service or facility designed for use without leaving one's car.
