deltohedron:/ˌdɛltəˈhiːdrən/
noun
三角面体，デルタ多面体
A polyhedron whose faces are all congruent equilateral triangles.  It is not necessarily a convex polyhedron, and there are infinitely many deltohedra.
The convex deltohedra are the deltahedra that are also convex polyhedra. There are only eight convex deltahedra.
例句：The triangular bipyramid is a simple example of a deltohedron.  三角双锥体是一个简单的三角面体例子。

例句：Some deltohedra can be flexed, meaning their shapes can be changed while keeping the faces rigid.  一些三角面体可以弯曲，这意味着它们的形状可以在保持面部刚性的同时改变。
synonym:deltahedra, triangular-faced polyhedron
antonym: (No direct antonym, but perhaps: non-deltohedron, polyhedron with non-triangular faces)
n.
