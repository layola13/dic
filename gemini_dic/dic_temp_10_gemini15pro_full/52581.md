diffusivity:/ˌdɪfjuːˈsɪvɪti/| n.|扩散率，扩散系数|The diffusivity of a substance is a measure of how quickly it spreads or disperses through a medium.|The diffusivity of heat in copper is much higher than in wood. 铜的热扩散率比木材高得多。|近义词：diffusion coefficient, diffusion rate, permeability|反义词: impermeability|词性:noun

Etymology: From diffuse (spread out) + -ivity (forming nouns of quality or state).  Ultimately from Latin diffusus, past participle of diffundere "to pour out, spread out."
