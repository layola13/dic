Etymology: From "luscious" + "-ly." "Luscious" comes from the Middle English "lucius," meaning "delightful," probably from an Anglo-French word related to "lasche," meaning "loose" or "lax."  The original sense might have referred to something soft and pleasant to the touch, which later extended to taste and other senses.
