词源:  Derived from "minx," meaning a pert, flirtatious young woman. The "-ish" suffix adds the meaning "like" or "having the qualities of." "Minx" itself likely originates from the Low German "minske" meaning "nun," ironically, as nuns were traditionally seen as the opposite of flirtatious.  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe a mischievous or impudent girl.
