ETYMOLOGY->
From poker terminology. An "ace in the hole" originally referred to a hidden ace dealt face down as a hole card, giving the player a strong, often decisive advantage. This poker usage dates back to the mid-19th century. The phrase "ace up one's sleeve" is an older variant, possibly originating from card cheats literally hiding an ace up their sleeve. Over time, both phrases became idiomatic expressions meaning a hidden advantage in any situation.
