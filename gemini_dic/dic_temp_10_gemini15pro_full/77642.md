gelatinities:/dʒɪˌlætɪˈnɪtiz/
n.| 胶凝性，胶凝状态|The gelatinities of the different agar samples were compared. 不同琼脂样品的胶凝性进行了比较。|例句：The scientist measured the gelatinities of various substances. 科学家测量了各种物质的胶凝性。

例句：The gelatinities of the jellies varied depending on their ingredients.  这些果冻的胶凝性因其成分而异。


|近义词：viscosity, thickness, firmness|反义词: fluidity, thinness|词性:名词


Etymology:
From gelatin + -ity (suffix forming abstract nouns denoting a state or quality) + -ies (plural suffix). Ultimately from Latin *gelātus (frozen, congealed) + -īn(us) (suffix forming adjectives) + -ity + -ies.
