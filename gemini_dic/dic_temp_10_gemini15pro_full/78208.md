ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *gēpund, a hypothetical reconstruction based on related forms in other Germanic languages, ultimately meaning "a weight of silver".  It's composed of *gē- (meaning "with, together") and pund (meaning "pound").  The modern spelling "pound" reflects this etymology, with the "ge-" prefix having been lost over time.
