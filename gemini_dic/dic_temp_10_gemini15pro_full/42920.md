covariance:/ˌkoʊˈværiəns/| n.|协方差|A measure of the joint variability of two random variables.  It indicates how much two variables change together. A positive covariance suggests the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance suggests they tend to move in opposite directions.|The covariance between stock prices and interest rates was negative. 股票价格和利率之间的协方差为负。|近义词：correlation, dependence|反义词:independence|名词
