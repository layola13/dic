noncapillaries:/nɒnˈkæpɪlərɪz/
|n.|非毛细血管|Blood vessels other than capillaries, including arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins.|Blood flows from arteries to arterioles to noncapillaries to venules to veins.|近义词：larger vessels, non-capillary vessels|反义词：capillaries|词性:名词

Etymology:
"Non-" is a prefix of Latin origin meaning "not". "Capillary" comes from the Late Latin word "capillaris," meaning "hair-like," ultimately derived from the Latin word "capillus," meaning "hair."  Therefore, "noncapillaries" literally means "not capillaries".
