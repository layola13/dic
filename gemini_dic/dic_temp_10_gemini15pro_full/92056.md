hyperpolarization:/ˌhaɪpərˌpoʊlərɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 超极化 |The process of making a cell's membrane potential more negative than its resting potential. This inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold.| Hyperpolarization following an action potential prevents the neuron from immediately firing again. 动作电位后的超极化防止神经元立即再次放电。| repolarization, afterpotential | depolarization | noun
