ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "addle," meaning "to make or become rotten," particularly applied to eggs.  The verb "addle" comes from Old English "adela," meaning "liquid filth," related to "adelen," meaning "to make foul."  The "-ings" suffix creates a plural noun form referring to the rotten eggs themselves.


USAGE->
The word "addlings" is not frequently used in modern English, especially in its figurative sense.  It is more common in older texts or dialectal speech.  Here are some example sentences demonstrating its usage:

一般现在时:
The smell of addlings permeates the barn. =  谷仓里弥漫着臭鸡蛋的味道。
He avoids eating addlings as they can cause illness. = 他避免吃坏掉的鸡蛋，因为它们会导致疾病。


一般过去时:

She discarded the addlings and started over. = 她扔掉了坏鸡蛋，重新开始。



现在完成时:

过去完成时:

将来时:

PHRASE->
a clutch of addlings = 一窝坏蛋

discover addlings = 发现坏蛋
discard the addlings = 丢弃坏蛋

注意事项:
While "addlings" can figuratively refer to a mess or confusion, this usage is quite archaic and might sound unusual in modern conversation.  It is best to use more common synonyms like "mess," "confusion," or "muddle" in most situations.
