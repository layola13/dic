ETYMOLOGY->
From French *bizarre*, from Italian *bizzarro* "irascible, strange," perhaps from Basque *bizar* "beard," from the practice of Spanish soldiers stationed in Italy in the 16th century of growing beards to look fiercer.  Another theory suggests it comes from the Italian word *bizzarria*, meaning "caprice, extravagance."
