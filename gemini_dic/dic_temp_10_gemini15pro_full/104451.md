The word "kaiket" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a slang term, a regionalism, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you could provide more context, like where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests information on the word "what," I can provide that analysis below:

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something.  | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
