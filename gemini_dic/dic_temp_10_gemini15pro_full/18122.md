PHRASE-> (Behither is not typically used in phrases.  It is a somewhat archaic word, and its modern usage is limited.)


词源：
From Middle English *behider, from Old English be hider (“hither”), equivalent to be- +‎ hither. Cognate with Middle Dutch behider (“hither”).


注意事项:
"Behither" is an archaic word and is rarely used in modern English.  "Hither" or simply "here" are more common and preferred alternatives.  Its inclusion in modern texts is often for stylistic effect, particularly in fantasy or historical fiction.
