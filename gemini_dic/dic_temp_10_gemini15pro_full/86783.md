注意事项:  (This section was not required in the original prompt, but is included for completeness)

Hem in is primarily used as a verb. Its noun form is less common.  The past tense and past participle are both "hemmed."  While "hemmed in" can be used literally to describe physical confinement, it can also be used figuratively to describe restriction or limitation.
