注意事项:

*  "Malgré" is more common in formal or literary contexts.  In everyday conversation, "despite" or "in spite of" are more frequently used.
* "Malgré que" is generally considered archaic and should be avoided in modern French and is translated to "although" in English.  It's better to use "bien que" or "quoique" instead.
