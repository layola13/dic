From French *déconcertement*, from *déconcerter* "to disconcert," from *des-* (expressing reversal) + *concerter* "to arrange, agree upon," from Italian *concertare*.  Ultimately from Latin *con-* "together" + *certare* "to contend, strive."  The sense evolution involves the disruption of a concerted or agreed-upon plan, leading to confusion and unease.
