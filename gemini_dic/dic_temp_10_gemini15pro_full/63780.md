词源: From the noun "epicure" + "-ly."  "Epicure" comes from Late Latin "Epicureus," referring to a follower of Epicurus, a Greek philosopher who advocated pleasure as the highest good.  Over time, the term shifted to refer specifically to someone devoted to sensual pleasures, especially fine food and drink.
