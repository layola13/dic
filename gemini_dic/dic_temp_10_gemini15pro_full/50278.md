dephosphorization:/diːˌfɒsfərəˈzeɪʃən/ |n.|脱磷；去磷|The dephosphorization of steel is a crucial step in steelmaking. 钢铁的脱磷是炼钢过程中至关重要的一步。| Dephosphorization is essential for improving the quality of the metal. 脱磷对于提高金属质量至关重要。|近义词: phosphorus removal|反义词: phosphorylation|词性: noun
ETYMOLOGY->
From de- (indicating removal or reversal) + phosphorylation (the process of introducing a phosphate group into a molecule).  The term "phosphorus" ultimately derives from Greek "phōsphoros" meaning "light-bearing," referring to the element's ability to glow in the dark.
