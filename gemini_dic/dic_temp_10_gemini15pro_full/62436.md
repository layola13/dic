endoplasmic:/ˌɛndəʊˈplæzmɪk/ | adj. | 内质的，内浆的 | Relating to the endoplasm of a cell. | The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. 内质网是真核细胞细胞质内的一个膜网络。| The endoplasmic reticulum plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. 内质网在蛋白质合成中起着至关重要的作用。 | 近义词: intracellular | 反义词: extracellular | 词性: adjective

endoplastica: Not a valid English word.  This appears to be a misspelling or a combination of "endoplasmic" and a Latin suffix.  The correct term, depending on the intended meaning, is likely "endoplasmic reticulum."

endoplasmic reticulum:/ɛndəʊˈplæzmɪk rɪˈtɪkjʊləm/ | n. | 内质网 | A network of membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell, continuous with the nuclear membrane. It usually has ribosomes attached and is involved in protein and lipid synthesis. | The rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes. 粗面内质网附着着核糖体。| The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in lipid metabolism. 滑面内质网参与脂质代谢。| 近义词: ER | 反义词:  (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun
