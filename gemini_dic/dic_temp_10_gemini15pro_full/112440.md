PHRASE->

(Since "lou" is a French pronoun, it doesn't have direct English phrases. However, here are some French phrases using "lou":)

Dis-moi, lou = Tell me, you
Salut lou = Hi, you
Comment vas-tu, lou? = How are you doing, you?
Qu'est-ce que tu fais, lou? = What are you doing, you?
Où vas-tu, lou? = Where are you going, you?


注意事项:
As a standalone word, "lou" is primarily used in certain dialects of Occitan, a language spoken in Southern France, parts of Italy and Spain.  It is not standard French. In standard French, the equivalent is "tu" (informal) or "vous" (formal).  The examples above are illustrative of how it *might* be used if it were grammatically correct standard French, purely for demonstrating the various tenses.  Native French speakers would not generally use "lou" in this way.
