obduction:/əbˈdʌkʃən/ | n. | 逆冲，仰冲；（地质学）地壳的覆盖 | The process by which oceanic lithosphere is thrust onto continental lithosphere. | The obduction of the oceanic plate formed a mountain range. 海洋板块的逆冲形成了山脉。 | synonyms: overthrust, thrusting | antonyms: subduction | noun


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Obduction forms mountains. = 逆冲形成山脉。
Obduction occurs at convergent plate boundaries. = 逆冲发生在汇聚板块边界。

Geologists are studying the obduction process. = 地质学家正在研究逆冲过程。
The oceanic plate is obducting onto the continental plate. = 海洋板块正在逆冲到大陆板块上。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The obduction has created a complex geological structure. = 逆冲创造了一个复杂的地质结构。
Scientists have studied obduction for many years. = 科学家们研究逆冲已经很多年了。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The plates have been obducting for millions of years. = 板块已经逆冲了数百万年。
Geologists have been researching this obduction zone for decades. = 地质学家们几十年来一直在研究这个逆冲带。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The obduction occurred millions of years ago. = 逆冲发生在数百万年前。
The process created a mountain range. = 这个过程创造了一个山脉。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The plates were obducting when the earthquake struck. = 地震发生时，板块正在逆冲。
The mountain range was forming as the plates collided. = 山脉在板块碰撞时形成。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The obduction had already occurred before the fossils were discovered. = 在发现化石之前，逆冲已经发生了。
The mountain range had formed by the time the first humans arrived. = 在第一批人类到来的时候，山脉已经形成了。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The plates had been obducting for millions of years before the continent formed. = 在大陆形成之前，板块已经逆冲了数百万年。
The forces had been building for a long time before the obduction finally happened. = 在逆冲最终发生之前，力量已经积累了很长时间。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The obduction will continue to shape the landscape. = 逆冲将继续塑造地貌。
Scientists will study the effects of the obduction. = 科学家将研究逆冲的影响。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Geologists will be studying the obduction zone for many years to come. = 地质学家们将在未来很多年里研究这个逆冲带。
The plates will be moving for millions of years. = 板块将继续移动数百万年。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the century, scientists will have learned more about obduction. = 到本世纪末，科学家将对逆冲有更多的了解。
The obduction will have changed the landscape significantly. = 逆冲将显著改变地貌。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By 2050, geologists will have been studying this obduction zone for over 50 years. = 到2050年，地质学家将已经研究这个逆冲带超过50年了。
The plates will have been moving for millennia by the time we fully understand the process. = 当我们完全理解这个过程时，板块将已经移动了数千年。


虚拟语气:
If the obduction had not occurred, the landscape would be different. = 如果没有发生逆冲，地貌将会不同。
If we could observe obduction directly, we would learn a great deal. = 如果我们能够直接观察逆冲，我们将学到很多东西。


被动语态:
The mountain range was formed by obduction. = 山脉是由逆冲形成的。
The process is being studied by geologists around the world. = 全世界的地质学家都在研究这个过程。


疑问句:
What causes obduction? = 什么导致逆冲？
How does obduction affect the landscape? = 逆冲如何影响地貌？


否定句:
Obduction does not occur at all plate boundaries. = 逆冲并非发生在所有板块边界。
The process is not fully understood. = 这个过程还没有被完全理解。

PHRASE->
obduction zone = 逆冲带
obduction process = 逆冲过程
continental obduction = 大陆逆冲
ophiolite obduction = 蛇绿岩逆冲
obduction-related metamorphism = 逆冲相关变质作用
