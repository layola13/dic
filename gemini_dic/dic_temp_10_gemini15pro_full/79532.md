globulin:/ˈɡlɒbjʊlɪn/ (US) /ˈɡlɑːbjəlɪn/| n. |球蛋白|A family of globular proteins that are generally insoluble in pure water but dissolve in dilute salt solutions. They are involved in a wide variety of biological functions including immunity, blood clotting, and transport of substances in the blood.|
Example 1:  A blood test revealed low levels of globulin.  血液检查显示球蛋白水平低。

Example 2: Gamma globulins are important for fighting infection. γ球蛋白对抵抗感染很重要。


|近义词：protein, |反义词: None|词性:noun
