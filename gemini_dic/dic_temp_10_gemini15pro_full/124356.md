ETYMOLOGY->
From motion + -less + -ly.  Motion comes from Old French *motiun (modern French motion), from Latin mōtiō (“a moving, motion”), from mōtus, past participle of movēre (“to move”).  The suffix -less is an Old English suffix meaning "without." The suffix -ly is also from Old English -lice, and forms adverbs.
