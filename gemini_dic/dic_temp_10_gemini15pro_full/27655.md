candidated:/ˈkændɪdeɪtɪd/ |  adj. | 已提名的；被推荐的 | Having been nominated as a candidate. This word is not standard English and is rarely used.  It's formed by adding "-ed" to "candidate," similar to how we form past participles, but in this case, it creates an unusual and generally unaccepted adjective.  Use "nominated" instead.|  *He felt candidated for the position, though he hadn't officially been nominated.* 他觉得自己已经被提名担任这个职位，尽管还没有正式提名。 | 近义词: nominated, proposed, recommended | 反义词: unnominated, rejected | 词性: adjective

词源: From the Latin word "candidatus," meaning "clothed in white," referring to the white togas worn by Roman candidates for office.
