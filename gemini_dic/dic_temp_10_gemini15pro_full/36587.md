词源： collateral + -ness + -es.  "Collateral" comes from Late Latin *collateralis, from Latin com- 'together with' + lateralis 'of the side'. "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns meaning 'state or quality of being'.  "-es" is a plural marker.  This word is rarely used and sounds awkward; using "qualities of the collateral" or similar phrases is generally preferred.
