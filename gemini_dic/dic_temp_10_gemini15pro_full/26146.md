词源: From the Middle French *buste*, from Italian *busto*, ultimately from Latin *bustum* "a tomb, funeral pyre". The meaning shifted from "tomb effigy" to "sculpture of the upper body". The meanings related to failure and raiding likely emerged later, perhaps influenced by the image of something being broken or "busted".
