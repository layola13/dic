词源: From Old North French *catel (compare Old French chatel "goods, property, possessions"), from Medieval Latin capitale "principal sum of money, capital," from Latin caput "head." The sense development is from "property in the form of livestock," as cattle were the most valuable movable property of agricultural communities.
