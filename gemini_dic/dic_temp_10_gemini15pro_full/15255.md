ETYMOLOGY->
From backhanded + -ness.  "Backhanded" originally referred to a stroke in tennis or other racket sports made with the back of the hand facing the direction of the stroke.  This developed a figurative sense of something done indirectly or deviously, often with a negative connotation. The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "backhanded" into the noun "backhandedness," referring to the quality or state of being backhanded.
