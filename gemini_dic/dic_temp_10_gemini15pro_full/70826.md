词源：The word "finicky" likely originated in the early 20th century as an alteration of "finicking," which itself comes from "finick," meaning "to do something meticulously." "Finick" is likely related to the now-obsolete verb "fink," meaning "to inform on someone," suggesting a sense of being overly concerned with small details or finding fault.
