From the phrasal verb "draw off," composed of "draw" (Old English *dragan, meaning "to pull, drag") and "off" (Old English *of, meaning "away from, off"). The original sense referred to the physical act of pulling something off or away, which later extended to the removal of liquids and the tactical withdrawal of troops.
