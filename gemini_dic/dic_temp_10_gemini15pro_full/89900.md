词源：From the verb "horrify," which comes from the Latin word "horrere" meaning "to bristle," "to shudder," or "to stand on end (with fear)."  The suffix "-fy" means "to make or cause to be." Therefore, "horrify" means "to cause to shudder with fear."  "Horrified" is the past participle of "horrify" used as an adjective.
