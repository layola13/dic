PHRASE->

(This word doesn't typically form set phrases.  It's generally used as a standalone adjective.)

词源:  "Cockly" comes from "cock," referring to a rooster. Roosters are often seen as symbols of pride and arrogance due to their strutting and crowing behavior.  Thus, "cockly" adopted the meaning of "arrogant" or "boastful."
