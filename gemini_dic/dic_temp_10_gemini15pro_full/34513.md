Etymology: From Middle English *clenen*, from Old English *clæne* ("clean, pure, clear, innocent, unsullied"), from Proto-Germanic *klainą* (“clean”), from Proto-Indo-European *k̂leyd- (“to stick, adhere”).  The past participle ending "-ed" is a standard English marker for regular verbs and some adjectives.
