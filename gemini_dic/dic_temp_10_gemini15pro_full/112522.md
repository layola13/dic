词源：

"Lovable" comes from the combination of "love" and the suffix "-able," which means "capable of being."  "Lovabilities" is the plural form of "lovability," which is formed by adding the suffix "-ity" to "lovable."  The suffix "-ity" is used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  "Love" itself has a complex etymology, deriving ultimately from Proto-Germanic *lubō, meaning "love, desire."
