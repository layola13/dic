词源：

From avowed + -ness + -'s.  "Avowed" comes from the Old French "avouer," meaning "to admit, confess, acknowledge," ultimately from Latin "advocare," meaning "to call to (oneself), summon."  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns from adjectives, denoting a state or quality.  The final "-'s" is the possessive marker.
