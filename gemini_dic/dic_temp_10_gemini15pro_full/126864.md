nappe:/næp/ | n. | 推覆体，覆盖层，褶皱 | A large sheetlike, recumbent fold, in which the strata on one limb have been thrust far over those of the other limb, generally along a low-angle thrust fault.  A tablecloth-like structure formed by a series of overlapping folds in rocks, especially sedimentary rocks, caused by compressional forces. | The nappe structure in the Alps is a testament to the immense tectonic forces at play. 阿尔卑斯山的推覆体结构证明了巨大的构造力的作用。

The geologists studied the nappe to understand the region's geological history. 地质学家研究了推覆体以了解该地区的地质历史。| 近义词: overthrust, sheet, fold | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, consider using terms like "unfolded strata" or "undeformed rock") | 词性: noun
