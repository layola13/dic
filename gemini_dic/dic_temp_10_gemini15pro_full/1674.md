acnode: /ˈækˌnoʊd/ | n. | 孤点; 孤立点 | An isolated point on a curve where two branches intersect without crossing; a point of intersection of two branches of a curve that have a common tangent at that point. | The graph of the equation y^2 = x^2(x+1) has an acnode at the origin.  该方程 y^2 = x^2(x+1) 的图像在原点有一个孤点。

The function f(x) = |x| has an acnode at x = 0. 函数 f(x) = |x| 在 x = 0 处有一个孤点。 | 近义词: cusp, isolated point | 反义词: node, intersection | 词性: 名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *acnodus, from Ancient Greek ἄκρον (ákron, “extremity, tip, peak”) +‎ Ancient Greek κόνδυλος (kóndulos, “knuckle, joint”).

USAGE->

The concept of an acnode is primarily used in mathematics, specifically in calculus and algebraic geometry.  Therefore, providing general usage examples in everyday language is not applicable.  Instead, we will demonstrate its usage within its mathematical context.

Example 1:
The curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 - x has acnodes at x = ±1.
曲线 y^2 = x^3 - x 在 x = ±1 处有孤点。

Example 2:
The acnode of the curve represents a point of tangency where the curve touches itself without crossing.
曲线的孤点表示一个相切点，曲线在此点接触自身而不交叉。

PHRASE->

Phrasal usage with "acnode" is highly uncommon outside of specific mathematical discussions.  Therefore, providing common phrases is not applicable.  Instead, we can offer example phrases demonstrating its use within a mathematical context:

1.  locating the acnode of a curve (定位曲线的孤点)
2.  analyzing the acnode of a function (分析函数的孤点)
3.  the properties of an acnode (孤点的性质)
4.  the acnode of a cubic curve (三次曲线的孤点)
5.  the acnode as a singular point (作为奇点的孤点)
