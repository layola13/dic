词源： "nonconference" is a relatively recent term, formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "conference."  The term "conference" itself comes from the Old French word "conference," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "conferre," meaning "to bring together" or "to compare."  The prefix "non-" emphasizes the distinction between traditional conferences and the more participatory, less formal approach of nonconferences.
