PHRASE->
This word is rarely used in common phrases.  Its formal and specific nature limits its use in colloquial expressions.  Therefore, common phrases are not readily available.


词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "pleading" (from the verb "to plead") + "-ly" (adverb suffix).  The word "plead" comes from Old French "plaider," ultimately from Latin "placitum," meaning "decree" or "opinion."
