**PHRASE->**

N/A (This word is rarely used in phrases, especially in its vulgar sense. Its primary usage as "with" or "and" is directly incorporated into sentences.)


**注意事项:**

The use of "cum" to refer to semen is highly offensive and should be avoided in all but the most explicit contexts.  Its use as a conjunction meaning "with" or "and" is more common in formal or technical writing, but even there, "and" or "with" are generally preferred for clarity.
