commutablenesses:/kəˌmjuːtəˈbɪlɪtɪz/| n. |可交换性|The quality or state of being commutable, especially of operators in mathematics.  This refers to the ability of two operations to be performed in either order with the same result. |The commutablenesses of addition and multiplication are fundamental properties in arithmetic.  加法和乘法的可交换性是算术的基本性质。

The commutablenesses of certain matrices are crucial in linear algebra. 某些矩阵的可交换性在线性代数中至关重要。 |近义词：interchangeability, permutability |反义词：non-commutability, non-interchangeability |词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From commutable + -ness.  "Commutable" comes from the Latin "commutare," meaning "to change, exchange," from "com-" (together) + "mutare" (to change).  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
