"fenasy" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term, a proper noun (like a place name or surname), or slang.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some suggestions.  For example, if it's a technical term, knowing the field would be helpful. If it's a misspelling, knowing the intended word would allow me to give you the correct information.

Since I cannot analyze "fenasy," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something; used to express surprise or disbelief |
