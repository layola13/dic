autoecism:/ɔːˈtɔɪˌsɪzəm/ |n.| 自居, 本地寄生|The autoecism of the rust fungus allows it to complete its life cycle on a single host plant.|锈菌的自居性使其能够在单一寄主植物上完成其生命周期。|Example 1:  The wheat leaf rust exhibits autoecism, completing its life cycle on wheat plants. 小麦叶锈病表现出自居性，在小麦植株上完成其生命周期。

Example 2: Autoecism simplifies the study of rust fungi because researchers don't need to find two different host plants. 自居性简化了对锈菌的研究，因为研究人员不需要寻找两种不同的寄主植物。|近义词:  monoecism (though slightly different, referring to having both male and female reproductive structures on the same plant)|反义词: heteroecism|词性: noun
