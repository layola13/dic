词源： "fast track" originated in American English in the mid-20th century, combining "fast" (meaning quick) and "track" (referring to a course or path).  It initially referred to a literal track for faster movement or progress, later evolving metaphorically to describe accelerated processes, especially in business and administration. "fast track" 起源于 20 世纪中叶的美国英语，结合了“fast”（意为快速）和“track”（指路线或路径）。它最初指的是字面上的快速移动或前进的轨道，后来隐喻地演变为描述加速过程，尤其是在商业和行政管理中。
