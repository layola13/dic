ETYMOLOGY->
From French *berbère*, from Arabic *barbarī* "barbarian," ultimately from Greek *βάρβαρος* (*bárbaros*)  "foreign, barbarous," imitative of unintelligible speech. Originally used by Greeks to refer to non-Greek speakers, the term was later adopted by Arabs and applied to North African populations.  The term "Amazigh" (plural: Imazighen) is the preferred self-designation.
