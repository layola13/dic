词源：nonextendibleness comes from "nonextendible" + "-ness".  "Nonextendible" is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "extendible," which comes from "extend" (meaning "to stretch out or lengthen") + the suffix "-ible" (meaning "capable of being").  "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "nonextendibleness" refers to the state or quality of not being able to be extended.
