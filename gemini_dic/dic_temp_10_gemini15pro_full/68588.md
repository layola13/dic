ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *fanaticus* ("inspired by a deity, frenzied, enthusiastic, fanatical"), derived from *fanum* ("temple, shrine"). Shortened form of "fanatic". Initially referred to sports enthusiasts, later broadened to include admirers of any kind. The meaning related to ventilation devices comes from a different source, ultimately from the Latin *vannus* ("fan, winnowing basket").
