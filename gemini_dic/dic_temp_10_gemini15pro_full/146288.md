ETYMOLOGY->

From over- + fastidious + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much". "Fastidious" comes from the Latin "fastidiosus," meaning "disgusting, loathsome," ultimately derived from "fastus" (disdain, arrogance) and "-diosus" (full of).  The meaning shifted over time to describe someone overly concerned with details and correctness.  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
