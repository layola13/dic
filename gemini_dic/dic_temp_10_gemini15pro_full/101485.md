iridium:/ɪˈrɪdiəm/ | n. |铱|A hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is the second-densest metal (after osmium) and is highly resistant to corrosion. It is used in alloys, electrical contacts, and other specialized applications. |Iridium is used in spark plugs because of its high melting point. 铱因其高熔点而用于火花塞。|Synonyms: None (as it's a specific element)|Antonyms: None (as it's a specific element)|noun
