effector:/ɪˈfektər/| n. |效应器；执行器；作用物|An effector is a muscle, gland, or organ capable of responding to a stimulus, especially a nerve impulse.|The muscles are the effectors that produce movement.|近义词: actuator, executor, organ, muscle, gland|反义词: sensor, receptor|词性: 名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *effector*, from Latin *efficere* "to carry out, accomplish," from *ex- "out" + *facere* "to do, make."

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The effector receives signals from the nervous system. = 效应器接收来自神经系统的信号。
Effectors carry out the body's responses to stimuli. = 效应器执行身体对刺激的反应。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The muscle effector is contracting now. = 肌肉效应器现在正在收缩。
The gland is releasing hormones as an effector. = 腺体作为效应器正在释放激素。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The effectors have responded to the stimulus. = 效应器已经对刺激做出了反应。
The muscle has contracted several times. = 肌肉已经收缩了好几次。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The gland has been releasing hormones for several minutes. = 腺体已经释放激素好几分钟了。
The effector has been responding to the changing environment. = 效应器一直在对变化的环境做出反应。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The effector received a signal and responded. = 效应器接收到了一个信号并做出了反应。
The muscle contracted quickly. = 肌肉迅速收缩。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The gland was releasing hormones when the temperature dropped. = 当温度下降时，腺体正在释放激素。
The effector was responding to the stimulus when it was interrupted. = 当效应器被打断时，它正在对刺激做出反应。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The effector had already responded before the second stimulus arrived. = 在第二个刺激到达之前，效应器已经做出了反应。
The muscle had contracted before the signal ended. = 在信号结束之前，肌肉已经收缩了。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The gland had been releasing hormones for hours before the levels stabilized. = 在水平稳定之前，腺体已经释放激素好几个小时了。
The effector had been working constantly before it finally failed. = 在最终失效之前，效应器一直在持续工作。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The effector will respond to the stimulus. = 效应器将对刺激做出反应。
The muscle will contract when the signal arrives. = 当信号到达时，肌肉将会收缩。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The gland will be releasing hormones throughout the night. = 腺体整个晚上都会释放激素。
The effector will be responding to changes in the environment. = 效应器将对环境的变化做出反应。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the effector will have completed its response. = 到明天，效应器将完成其反应。
The muscle will have contracted several times by the end of the experiment. = 到实验结束时，肌肉将收缩多次。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the gland will have been releasing hormones for a full month. = 到下周，腺体将已经释放激素整整一个月了。
The effector will have been responding to the stimulus for several hours by the time we check it. = 到我们检查它的时候，效应器将已经对刺激做出反应好几个小时了。


PHRASE->
effector molecule = 效应分子
effector cell = 效应细胞
effector function = 效应器功能
effector proteins = 效应蛋白
effector mechanisms = 效应机制
