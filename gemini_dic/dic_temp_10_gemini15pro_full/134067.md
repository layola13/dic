词源：
Nonignominiousnesses comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "ignominious" (meaning "dishonorable; shameful") + "-ness" (a suffix that forms nouns denoting a state or quality).  The word "ignominious" itself derives from the Latin "ignominia" (loss of reputation, disgrace), from "in-" (not) + "nomen" (name, reputation).  Therefore, "nonignominiousnesses" literally means the state of not being without a name or reputation, hence honor or respectability.
