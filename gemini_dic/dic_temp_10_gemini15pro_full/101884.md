Etymology:
From Greek "isch-" (to suppress) + "-ouretic" (relating to urine).  While the prefix "isch-" suggests suppression, the overall meaning of "ischuretic" pertains to increasing urine flow, likely due to suppressing the reabsorption of water in the kidneys.  More commonly used is "diuretic," which comes from Greek "dia-" (through) + "-ouretic."
