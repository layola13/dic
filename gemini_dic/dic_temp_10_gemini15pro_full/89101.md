注意事项:
词源信息:  "homacanth" likely derives from Greek elements "homo-" (same, similar) and "acanth-" (thorn, spine), referring to the similar spines found on these fish.  However, it's not a standard scientific term. "Acanth-" is the more common root used in ichthyology, seen in the family name Acanthuridae. "Homacanth" might be an older or less common variant, or a colloquial term.  It's more common to see  "acanthurid" used as the adjective and "surgeonfish," "tang," or "unicornfish" as common names.
