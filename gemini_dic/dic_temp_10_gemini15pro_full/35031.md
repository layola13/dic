ETYMOLOGY->
"close" (adv.) Old English *clōs "near, shut," from Proto-Germanic *khlusaz (source also of Old Saxon clos, Old Frisian clos, Middle Dutch cloos, Dutch kloos "enclosed space," Old High German chluz "lock, bolt, enclosed space," German Kloss "clod, dumpling"), from PIE root *klau- "hook, to bend."
"crop" (v.) Old English croppan "cut off, reap, gather," from Proto-Germanic *krup- (source also of Old Norse kroppa "to pluck," Middle Dutch croppen, Dutch kroppen "to crop, pluck," Old High German chroffan "to pluck," German kropfen "to cram"), from PIE root *gerbh- "to pluck, scratch, carve."  The sense evolution is from "top or head of a plant," to "top or highest part of anything," to "act of cutting off the top."  The combined meaning of "close-cropped" therefore refers to something cut very short and close.
