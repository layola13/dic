Etymology:
From dis- + estimation.  "Dis-" is a prefix of Latin origin meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force. "Estimation" comes from the Old French "estimacion" and ultimately the Latin "aestimatio," meaning "valuation," from "aestimare" "to value, appraise."
