irrelevant:/ɪˈreləvənt/ | adj. | 不相关的，不重要的 | Not related to the subject or situation; not important or pertinent. |  Her comments were completely irrelevant to the discussion. 她的评论与讨论完全无关。

The details are irrelevant to our main purpose. 这些细节与我们的主要目的无关。| 近义词：inapplicable, immaterial, extraneous, beside the point | 反义词：relevant, pertinent, applicable, germane | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
From in- (not) + relevant (from Latin *relevare, frequentative of relevare "to raise, lift up," from re- "again" + levare "to lift").  The sense development is from "lifting up again" to "relieving, easing" to "applying to the matter at hand." Thus, irrelevant means "not applying to the matter at hand."
