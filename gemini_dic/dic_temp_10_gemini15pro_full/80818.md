USAGE->

USAGE->
一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The program often goes to the error handling routine when it encounters a problem.  程序遇到问题时经常跳转到错误处理例程。
The code goes to the next section after completing this function. 代码在完成此函数后转到下一部分。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The debugger is showing that the execution is going to the wrong label.  调试器显示执行正在跳转到错误的标签。
The program is going to an infinite loop because of the goto statement. 由于 goto 语句，程序正在进入无限循环。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The program has gone to the specified label several times. 程序已经多次跳转到指定的标签。
The execution has gone to the end of the file unexpectedly. 执行意外地跳转到了文件末尾。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been going to the same subroutine repeatedly, causing a performance issue. 程序一直重复跳转到同一个子程序，导致性能问题。
The debugger has been going to the wrong memory address, making it difficult to track the bug.  调试器一直跳转到错误的内存地址，使得难以追踪错误。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program went to the error handling section when the input was invalid. 当输入无效时，程序跳转到错误处理部分。
The execution went to the next function call as expected.  执行按预期跳转到下一个函数调用。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was going to an infinite loop when I stopped the debugger. 当我停止调试器时，程序正在进入无限循环。
The execution was going to the wrong label, causing unexpected behavior. 执行正在跳转到错误的标签，导致意外行为。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had gone to the initialization routine before entering the main loop. 程序在进入主循环之前已经跳转到初始化例程。
The execution had gone to the end of the function before the expected return. 执行在预期的返回之前已经跳转到函数的末尾。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been going to the same function repeatedly for several seconds before crashing. 程序在崩溃之前已经重复跳转到同一个函数好几秒了。
The debugger had been going to the wrong memory location, making it impossible to find the error. 调试器一直跳转到错误的内存位置，导致无法找到错误。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will go to the next instruction after completing this one. 程序在完成此指令后将跳转到下一条指令。
The code will go to the specified label if the condition is met. 如果满足条件，代码将跳转到指定的标签。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be going to the error handling routine if the input is invalid. 如果输入无效，程序将跳转到错误处理例程。
The execution will be going to the next function call after this one completes. 在此函数调用完成后，执行将跳转到下一个函数调用。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The program will have gone to the specified label several times by the end of the execution. 到执行结束时，程序将已经多次跳转到指定的标签。
The execution will have gone to the end of the file by then. 到那时，执行将已经跳转到文件末尾。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the time we detect the error, the program will have been going to the wrong function for several minutes. 当我们检测到错误时，程序将已经跳转到错误的函数好几分钟了。
The debugger will have been going to the wrong memory address, making it difficult to identify the problem. 调试器将已经跳转到错误的内存地址，导致难以识别问题。


PHRASE->
goto statement  goto语句
goto label  goto标签
goto destination  goto目标
goto command  goto命令
goto instruction  goto指令


注意事项:  `goto` statement is generally considered harmful in structured programming due to its potential to create spaghetti code, making it difficult to understand and maintain.  在结构化编程中，`goto` 语句通常被认为是有害的，因为它可能会产生难以理解和维护的意大利面条式代码。
