arlock: /ˈɑːrˌlɒk/ | n. | 气锁; 空气闭锁 | An airlock is a small compartment with two airtight doors that is used for entering or leaving a spacecraft, submarine, or other pressurized vessel.  It allows the pressure to be equalized between the inside and outside environments without significant loss of pressure in the main compartment. | Example:  The astronauts used the arlock to enter the space station. 宇航员使用气闸进入空间站。
Example: The submarine's arlock was flooded during the emergency dive.  潜艇的气闸在紧急下潜时被淹没了。 | 近义词: air lock, pressure lock | 反义词: (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun
