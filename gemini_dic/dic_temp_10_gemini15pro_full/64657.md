ETYMOLOGY->
From Spanish *ensalada*, meaning "salad" (originally referring to a dish of seasoned cooked greens). Over time, the term evolved to refer to various filled and wrapped food items, particularly in Mexican cuisine.  The *en-* prefix eventually dropped in some regional variations, leading to *esada*.
