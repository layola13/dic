ETYMOLOGY->
From aerodynamic + -s (plural marker).  Aerodynamic comes from aero- (Greek, "air") + dynamic (Greek, "power").

USAGE->
This word is not commonly used.  "Aerodynamics" is typically used as a singular noun, even when referring to the properties of multiple objects. However, if used, it would follow standard plural noun usage.

一般现在时:
The aerodynamicses of the plane affect its fuel efficiency. = 飞机的空气动力学特性会影响其燃油效率。
The aerodynamicses of these cars are crucial for their performance. = 这些汽车的空气动力学特性对其性能至关重要。

一般过去时:
The aerodynamicses of older planes were not as well understood. = 老式飞机的空气动力学特性不如现在了解得透彻。
The engineers analyzed the aerodynamicses of the prototype. = 工程师们分析了原型的空气动力学特性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the aerodynamicses of birds for inspiration. = 科学家们研究了鸟类的空气动力学特性以获取灵感。
Researchers have improved the aerodynamicses of modern aircraft significantly. = 研究人员已经显著改善了现代飞机的空气动力学特性。


过去完成时:
They had tested the aerodynamicses before launching the rocket. = 他们在发射火箭之前已经测试了空气动力学特性。
The team had analyzed the aerodynamicses of various designs before settling on the final one. = 在确定最终设计之前，团队已经分析了各种设计的空气动力学特性。

将来时:
Engineers will continue to refine the aerodynamicses of future aircraft. = 工程师将继续改进未来飞机的空气动力学特性。
New materials will allow for even better aerodynamicses in car design. = 新材料将使汽车设计拥有更好的空气动力学特性。

虚拟语气:
If the aerodynamicses were better, the car would be faster. = 如果空气动力学特性更好，汽车会更快。
I wish the aerodynamicses of this plane were improved. = 我希望这架飞机的空气动力学特性能够得到改进。

被动语态:
The aerodynamicses of the car were tested in a wind tunnel. = 汽车的空气动力学特性在风洞中进行了测试。
The aerodynamicses are being analyzed to optimize performance. = 正在分析空气动力学特性以优化性能。

疑问句:
What are the aerodynamicses of this new design? = 这个新设计的空气动力学特性是什么？
How do the aerodynamicses affect fuel consumption? = 空气动力学特性如何影响油耗？

否定句:
The aerodynamicses of this model are not optimal. = 此模型的空气动力学特性不是最佳的。
The engineers did not fully consider the aerodynamicses. = 工程师没有充分考虑空气动力学特性。


PHRASE-> (Since "aerodynamicses" is unusual, phrases are hard to come by.  These relate to the more common "aerodynamics")

the aerodynamics of (something) = （某物）的空气动力学
improve aerodynamics = 改进空气动力学
study aerodynamics = 研究空气动力学
the principles of aerodynamics = 空气动力学原理
affected by aerodynamics = 受空气动力学影响


注意事项:  The word "aerodynamicses" is rarely used.  It is much more common and natural to use "aerodynamics" as a singular noun encompassing all the relevant properties.  For example, "The aerodynamics of the car are excellent" is grammatically acceptable and commonly used, even though "aerodynamics" is singular.
