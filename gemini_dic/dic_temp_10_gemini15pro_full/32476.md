PHRASE->
(While "chinche" as an insect doesn't have many set phrases in English, its slang usage in Latin American Spanish is more versatile. Here are some phrases using the slang meaning:)

¡Qué chinche! = What a nuisance!/How annoying!
Ser un chinche = To be a pest/nuisance.
Estar chinche = To be annoying/a bother.
¡No seas chinche! = Don't be annoying!/Stop bothering me!
Hacerse el chinche = To play dumb/act innocent.


注意事项:
"Chinche" as a word for "bedbug" is less common in English than "bedbug."  It is more frequently encountered in Spanish-speaking regions, especially Latin America.  It can also be used as a slang term in Latin American Spanish to mean "nuisance," "pest," or "annoying thing."  This slang usage is not typically found in English.
