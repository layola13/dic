PHRASE-> (Since "himselve" is nonstandard, phrases using it would also be nonstandard.  Therefore, these examples use the correct form "himself.")

by himself = 独自地
all by himself = 完全靠他自己
to himself = 혼자서 (Korean, meaning "by oneself")
for himself = 为了他自己
he himself = 他本人


注意事项:  Because "himselve" is nonstandard, it's best to avoid using it and use "himself" instead.  The examples above demonstrate how it *might* be used, but they are not considered grammatically correct.
