oxygens:/ˈɒksɪdʒənz/ | n. |氧气（复数）|Plural form of oxygen, referring to multiple instances or types of oxygen.  It's less common than the singular form but can be used in scientific contexts when discussing different isotopes or states of oxygen.|The experiment required different isotopes of oxygens.|Synonyms: O2 (chemical formula), air (loosely, as air contains oxygen) |Antonyms:  (No direct antonym for oxygen, potentially an inert gas in specific contexts like welding) | noun
