inductile:/ɪnˈdʌktɪl/ | adj. | 非延展性的；不柔韧的；不易拉长的 | Not ductile; not capable of being drawn out into wire or threads. |  The material proved to be inductile and unsuitable for wiring.  这种材料被证明是不易拉伸的，不适合用于布线。 |  Brittle, fragile, unyielding | Ductile, malleable, pliable | adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + ductile (capable of being drawn out into a wire).  Ductile comes from the Latin word ductilis, from ducere (to lead, draw).
