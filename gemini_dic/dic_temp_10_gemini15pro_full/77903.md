注意事项:
*  While "genie" has become the more common spelling in modern usage, "genii" is an accepted plural form, particularly in older texts and when referring to multiple magical spirits.  "Genii's" is therefore grammatically correct as the possessive form of this plural.
*  "Geniuses'" is the possessive form when referring to people of exceptional talent (plural of genius).  It's important not to confuse these two.
