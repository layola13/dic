amphitropal: /æmˈfɪtrəpəl/
adjective
双向的，两侧的，横生的(指胚珠)
(of an ovule) partly inverted; campylotropous.  The ovule is curved in such a way that the micropyle and chalaza are approximately at the same level, but the micropyle is directed away from the funiculus.
Example: The amphitropal ovule orientation is less common than other types, such as anatropous.  横生胚珠的方向不如其他类型常见，例如倒生胚珠。

Example:  Some members of the family Chenopodiaceae exhibit amphitropal ovules.  藜科的一些成员表现出横生胚珠。
近义词: campylotropous
反义词: orthotropous, anatropous
词性: adjective

Etymology:
From Greek amphi- (ἀμφί-, “around, both, on both sides”) + tropal (from Greek τρόπος, trópos, “turn, way, manner, direction”)
