词源: From Old French afronter "to strike on the forehead, confront, insult," from a- "to" (see ad-) + front "forehead" (from Latin frontem, accusative of frons).  The original sense was to strike someone on the forehead, a grave insult.  The meaning later broadened to encompass any action or remark causing offense.
