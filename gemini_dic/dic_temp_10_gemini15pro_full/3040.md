反义词:anaerobic
词性:形容词


ETYMOLOGY->
From aero- (air) + biotic (relating to life).  来自aero-（空气）+ biotic（与生命有关）。


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Aerobiotic bacteria are essential for composting. = 需氧细菌对堆肥至关重要。
This species is aerobiotic and requires oxygen to survive. =  这个物种是需氧的，需要氧气才能生存。

一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated that the organism was aerobiotic. = 实验表明该生物是需氧的。
The researchers discovered that the bacteria were aerobiotic. = 研究人员发现这些细菌是需氧的。

现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many aerobiotic microorganisms. = 科学家已经鉴定出许多需氧微生物。
Researchers have studied the role of aerobiotic bacteria in various ecosystems. = 研究人员已经研究了需氧细菌在各种生态系统中的作用。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of anaerobic life, all known organisms had been considered aerobiotic. = 在发现厌氧生命之前，所有已知的生物都被认为是需氧的。
Scientists had assumed the bacteria were aerobiotic until further testing revealed otherwise. = 科学家们一直假设这些细菌是需氧的，直到进一步的测试显示并非如此。


将来时:
If oxygen levels decrease, the aerobiotic organisms will die. = 如果氧气水平下降，需氧生物将会死亡。
Future research will focus on the specific metabolic pathways of these aerobiotic bacteria. = 未来的研究将集中于这些需氧细菌的特定代谢途径。

虚拟语气:
If the environment were anaerobic, these aerobiotic organisms would not survive. = 如果环境是厌氧的，这些需氧生物将无法生存。

The growth of aerobiotic bacteria was observed in the presence of oxygen. = 在有氧的情况下观察到需氧细菌的生长。

疑问句:
Is this organism aerobiotic or anaerobic? = 这种生物是需氧的还是厌氧的？
Are these bacteria capable of aerobiotic respiration? = 这些细菌能够进行需氧呼吸吗？

否定句:
These bacteria are not aerobiotic; they thrive in oxygen-free environments. = 这些细菌不是需氧的；它们在无氧环境中茁壮成长。
The organism did not exhibit aerobiotic growth in the experiment. =  该生物体在实验中没有表现出需氧生长。


PHRASE->
aerobiotic respiration = 需氧呼吸
aerobiotic bacteria = 需氧细菌
aerobiotic organisms = 需氧生物
aerobiotic process = 需氧过程
aerobiotic environment =  需氧环境
