kenogenetic:/ˌkiːnədʒəˈnɛtɪk/
adjective
具有后生性的；非遗传的；适应性的
Relating to characteristics of an organism that are acquired during development and not genetically determined; adaptive.
Kenogenetic adaptations, unlike palingenetic ones, are not inherited from ancestral forms. 后生性适应，不像重演性适应，不是从祖先那里遗传来的。
Kenogenetic characters are often contrasted with palingenetic characters. 后生性状常与重演性状进行对比。
近义词: acquired, adaptive
