microsecond: /ˈmaɪkroʊˌsɛkənd/ (US) /ˈmaɪkrəʊˌsɛkənd/ (UK)| n. |微秒|One millionth of a second.|例句：A microsecond is a very short period of time. 一微秒是非常短的一段时间。|例句：The computer can perform calculations in microseconds. 这台计算机可以在微秒内进行计算。|近义词：µs (symbol), one millionth of a second|反义词: second, millisecond|词性:noun

Etymology->
From micro- + second.  "Micro-" comes from the Greek "mikros" meaning "small." "Second" in this context refers to a sixtieth of a minute, ultimately derived from Latin "secunda," meaning "second" (part of an hour or a degree).
