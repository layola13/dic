aphlogistic:/ˌæfləˈdʒɪstɪk/
adjective
无火的；不燃烧的；不发光的
Relating to or denoting combustion in which phlogiston is not released.  (historical) Also: not flammable.
The aphlogistic lamp, with its platinum catalyst, demonstrated a new principle of oxidation.  这种无火灯凭借其铂催化剂展示了一种新的氧化原理。
近义词: non-flammable, non-combustible
反义词: flammable, combustible
词性: adjective

词源:
From a- (not) + phlogiston (a hypothetical substance formerly thought to be released during combustion) + -ic.  来自 a- (不) + phlogiston (燃素，一种以前被认为在燃烧过程中释放的假想物质) + -ic。
