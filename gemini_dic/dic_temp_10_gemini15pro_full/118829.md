metapectin:/ˌmetəˈpɛktɪn/ | n. | 变性果胶 | A modified form of pectin produced by enzymatic action during the ripening of fruit. It is characterized by a lower degree of esterification and a reduced ability to form gels. | The metapectin content increases as the fruit overripens.  水果过熟时，变性果胶含量会增加。| The breakdown of protopectin into metapectin softens the fruit. 原果胶分解成变性果胶会使水果变软。 | synonyms: modified pectin, degraded pectin | antonyms: protopectin | noun
