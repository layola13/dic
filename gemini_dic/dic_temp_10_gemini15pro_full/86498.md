Heintzlinger is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's highly likely to be a surname, a proper noun, or possibly a misspelling.  Therefore, providing a standard linguistic breakdown (pronunciation, part of speech, etc.) is not possible.

If you have more context, such as where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer more information.  For example, if it's a surname,  genealogical resources might be helpful in determining its origin and meaning.  If it's a misspelling, knowing the intended word would allow for proper analysis.
