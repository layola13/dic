词源：From the Greek word *katarrhaktes* (καταρράκτης) meaning "falling down," "rushing down,"  related to *katarēgnumi* (καταρρήγνυμι) "to break down, burst down".  The word “cataract” originally referred to waterfalls and later came to be used for the medical condition due to the perceived resemblance of the cloudy lens to a waterfall.
