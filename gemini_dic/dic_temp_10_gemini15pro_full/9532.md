ETYMOLOGY->
From French *antisémitisme*, from *anti-* (against) + *sémite* (Semite), ultimately from Late Latin *Sēm* (Shem).  The term was coined in the late 19th century to give a supposedly scientific veneer to prejudice against Jews.  Originally, the term "Semite" referred to people who spoke Semitic languages (including Arabic and Hebrew), but it was hijacked by anti-Jewish ideologues to refer specifically to Jews.
