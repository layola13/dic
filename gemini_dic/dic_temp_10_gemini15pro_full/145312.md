The correct term is "overbrightness," which refers to excessive brightness.  The apostrophe and "s" likely indicate a possessive form, though its usage is non-standard and should generally be avoided.  A more natural way to express possession would be "the overbrightness of the screen" or "the screen's overbrightness." | Example 2: The overbrightness of the image made it difficult to see the details.  图像的过亮使得难以看清细节。 | Near synonyms: excessive brightness, glare, luminance | Antonyms: dimness, darkness | Noun
