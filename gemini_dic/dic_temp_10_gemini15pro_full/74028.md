注意事项:  As mentioned earlier, "forwaste" isn't a standard dictionary word.  Using more established terms like "waste," "garbage," "trash," "refuse," or "rubbish" is generally recommended in formal writing.  However, in informal contexts or within specific industries or communities, it might be understandable.
