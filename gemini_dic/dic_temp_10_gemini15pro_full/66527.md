Etymology:  From exhaust + -ibility.  "Exhaust" comes from the Latin *exhaustus*, past participle of *exhaurire* "to draw out completely," from *ex-* "out" + *haurire* "to draw, drain."  "-ibility" is a suffix forming nouns of quality, from the French *-ibilité* and ultimately from Latin *-ibilitatem*.
