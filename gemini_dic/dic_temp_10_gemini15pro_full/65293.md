euctical: /juːˈtɛktɪkəl/
adjective
共晶的;易熔的
Relating to a eutectic mixture or alloy or its formation.  A eutectic system is a homogeneous, solid mixture of two or more substances that form a super-lattice; the mixture melts or solidifies at a lower temperature than the melting point of any of the individual substances.
The eutectical point is the lowest temperature at which the mixture is completely liquid.
近义词: fusible, easily melted
反义词: refractory, infusible
词性: adjective

Etymology: From Greek "eutektos," meaning "easily melted," from "eu-" (well) + "tektos" (melting).
