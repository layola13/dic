词源:  "Job's worth" originally referred to someone who meticulously performs only the tasks specifically outlined in their job description, implying they are only worth the amount they are paid and no more.  Over time, the term evolved to describe someone who rigidly adheres to rules and regulations, often to the detriment of others.
