equimomental:/ˌiːkwɪməˈmɛntəl/ | adj. | 等力矩的，等惯性矩的 | Having the same moments of inertia about all axes.  This means that two equimomental bodies will behave identically in rotational motion, even if their shapes and mass distributions are different. |  Example: A solid sphere and a hollow sphere with the same mass and radius are equimomental about their centers.  一个实心球体和一个具有相同质量和半径的空心球体，相对于它们的中心是等惯性矩的。| Synonym: isoinertial | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "differentially inertial") | Word type: Adjective
