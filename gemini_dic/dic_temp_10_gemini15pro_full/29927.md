ETYMOLOGY-> From French *cavalier*, from Italian *cavaliere*, horseman, knight, from Late Latin *caballarius*, horseman, from *caballus*, horse.  The sense of "offhand or disdainful disregard of others" arose in the 17th century, likely from the perceived arrogance associated with the aristocratic cavalry officers.
