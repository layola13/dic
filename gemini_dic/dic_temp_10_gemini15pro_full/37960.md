注意事项:
This word is not commonly used in modern English.  "Complexion" by itself is much more frequently used.  Therefore, the examples provided use the word in grammatically correct sentences, but the sentences themselves may sound a little unnatural due to the rarity of the word.  Using "complexion" directly would generally be preferred in modern usage.
