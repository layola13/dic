Etymology:
From gangster + -ish.  Gangster comes from gang + -ster. Gang ultimately derives from Old Norse *gangr "a going, a course," related to "go." The suffix -ster originally denoted a person engaged in a particular activity, often with negative connotations. The suffix -ish indicates resemblance or characteristic of something.
