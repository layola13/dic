The word "panm" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a typo or a newly coined term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. If you meant another word, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist you.

If "panm" is a specific jargon, acronym, or slang term within a particular field or community, please provide more context so I can attempt to offer some information.
