chromatography:/ˌkroʊməˈtɒɡrəfi/ | n. | 色谱法 | A laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture.  The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. |  Gas chromatography was used to identify the components of the perfume.  气相色谱法被用来鉴定香水的成分。 | synonyms: separation, analysis, fractionation | antonyms: mixture, combination | noun

chromatographic:/ˌkroʊməˌtəˈɡræfɪk/ | adj. | 色谱的 | Relating to or using chromatography. | The chromatographic analysis revealed the presence of several impurities. 色谱分析显示存在几种杂质。 | synonyms: separative | antonyms: combined | adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *khrōmat-* (color) + *-graphos* (writing)  + *-y*.  Originally coined to describe the separation of colored plant pigments.
