menopauses: /ˈmɛnəˌpɔːzɪz/ | n. | 更年期（复数）| The biological stage in a woman's life when menstruation ceases permanently, marking the end of her reproductive capacity.  It's often accompanied by various physical and emotional changes. | Many women experience hot flashes during menopause. 许多女性在更年期会经历潮热。

Menopauses is not typically used in the plural form as it refers to a single biological process.  The singular, menopause, is more common.  However, if discussing the menopausal experiences of multiple women, one might say "the menopauses of these women were all different," although this is less common. 更年期通常不用复数形式，因为它指的是一个单一的生物过程。单数形式menopause更常见。然而，如果讨论多个女性的更年期经历，人们可能会说“这些女性的更年期都不同”，尽管这种情况不太常见。 | 近义词: climacteric (医学术语) | 反义词:  N/A (没有直接的反义词，可以考虑 puberty 青春期，作为生命周期中相对的阶段) | 词性: 名词
