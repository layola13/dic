ETYMOLOGY->
From "clubhouse," a compound of "club" (meaning a group of people associated for a common purpose) and "house" (a building for human habitation). "Club" ultimately derives from Old Norse "klubba" (club, cudgel), while "house" comes from Old English "hūs."  The plural form "clubhouses" simply adds the regular English plural suffix "-es."
