biophysicses:/ˌbaɪoʊˈfɪzɪksiːz/
noun
生物物理学（复数）
The study of biological systems and processes using the principles and methods of physics.  This plural form is rare and generally considered non-standard.  "Biophysics" in the singular is typically used even when referring to multiple branches or applications of the field.
Biophysics encompasses a broad range of topics, from molecular interactions to ecosystem dynamics.  生物物理学涵盖了从分子相互作用到生态系统动力学的广泛主题。
Due to the interdisciplinary nature of biophysics, biophysicists often work in teams with other scientists, such as biologists, chemists, and mathematicians. 由于生物物理学的跨学科性质，生物物理学家经常与其他科学家（例如生物学家、化学家和数学家）合作。
