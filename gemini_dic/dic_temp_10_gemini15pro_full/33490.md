chyometer: /kaɪˈɒmɪtər/ (No standard pronunciation found; this is a constructed pronunciation based on likely Greek roots) | n. | 乳糜计，乳糜度计 | An instrument (hypothetical or obsolete) used to measure the properties of chyle.  This word is not in common usage and likely represents a specialized or historical term. It's formed from "chylo-" (relating to chyle) and "-meter" (an instrument for measuring). |  No reliable examples found due to the obscurity of the word. A contrived example: "The scientist used a chyometer to analyze the chyle sample." | Near synonyms:  (No direct synonyms exist due to the word's rarity.  Potentially "lactoscope" if used to measure milk fat in a similar way to how chyle might be analyzed.) | Antonyms: (None) | Noun
