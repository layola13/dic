nephrostome: /ˈnɛfrəˌstoʊm/ | n. | 肾口;肾孔 | The funnel-shaped opening of the nephridium (excretory organ) in some invertebrates, such as segmented worms and mollusks, through which waste products are excreted. |  The nephrostome collects waste products from the coelom. 肾口从体腔中收集废物。| synonyms: nephridial opening, excretory pore | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, but could consider structures involved in intake like mouth or spiracle in a broad physiological context) | noun

nephrostome: /ˈnɛfrəˌstoʊm/ | n. | 肾口;肾孔 |  In vertebrates, especially in the embryonic stage, the nephrostome refers to the opening of the nephrotome into the coelom.  It is a precursor to parts of the kidney system. |  The embryonic nephrostome plays a crucial role in early kidney development. 胚胎肾口在早期肾脏发育中起着至关重要的作用。 | synonyms:  (In the vertebrate context, there aren't readily available synonyms.  Terms like "nephrotome opening" could be considered, but are less common) | antonyms: (Similar to the invertebrate case, no direct antonym) | noun
