词源：From Middle English *imp, impe, from Old English impa, from Proto-Germanic *umpō (“scion, shoot, sapling”), from Proto-Indo-European *h₁embʰi- (“around, about”). Cognate with Old Norse imbi (“boy, son”), Old High German imbi (“bee”), and perhaps Latin umbilicus (“navel”). Originally meaning "offspring, child". The sense "small demon" arose by association with the demons believed to attend on the Devil.
