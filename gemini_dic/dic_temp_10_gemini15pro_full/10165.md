ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *apophlegmatismus, from Ancient Greek ἀποφλεγματισμός (apophlegmatismos, “clearing of phlegm”), from ἀποφλεγματίζω (apophlegmatizō, “I clear of phlegm”), from ἀπό (apo, “away from”) + φλέγμα (phlegma, “phlegm”).  In ancient medicine, phlegm was considered one of the four humors, believed to cause sluggishness and apathy. Removing it was thought to promote alertness and emotional balance.  The word eventually evolved to describe the state of calmness and composure itself.
