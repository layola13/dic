ETYMOLOGY->
From French *diplomatique*, from Late Latin *diplomaticus*, from Greek *diplōma* "folded document, letter of introduction," from *diploun* "to fold double."  The original sense related to official documents and treaties. The modern sense of "tactful and skillful in dealing with sensitive matters" developed later.
