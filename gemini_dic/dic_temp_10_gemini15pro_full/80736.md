注意事项: This word is borrowed directly from Japanese and refers specifically to the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. While the individual kingdoms (Wei, Shu, Wu) have their own Chinese names, the collective term "Three Kingdoms" is often represented using the Japanese term "Gosankoku" in English, particularly in academic and historical contexts related to East Asian studies.  It's important to be aware of this nuance.  Using "Gosankoku" might not be universally understood outside specific academic circles.
