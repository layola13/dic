The word "mehes" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it's from or where you encountered it, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage for the word "what," I can provide that information.  Please note that "what" is a complex word with multiple functions.

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wɑːt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonyms: which, whatever | Antonyms: (No direct antonyms for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
