词源:  From French *Berbère*, from Arabic *barbarī* (“foreign, non-Arab”), ultimately from Ancient Greek *βάρβαρος* (*bárbaros*).  The term originally referred to anyone who did not speak Greek and was considered by the Greeks to be uncivilized.  It was later adopted by the Romans and Arabs and applied to various groups.  The term is now sometimes considered pejorative and the term Amazigh is preferred by many Berbers.
