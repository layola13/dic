注意事项:  "oones" itself isn't a recognized English word.  This analysis assumes the intended word was "one's," the possessive form of the pronoun "one."  It's important to differentiate "one's" from the contraction "ones'," which is the plural possessive (e.g., "The ones' coats were hanging in the closet.").
