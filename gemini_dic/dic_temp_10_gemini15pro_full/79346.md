词源：From Old French *glener, from Frankish *klinōn "to gather, to lean," from Proto-Germanic *hlinōną "to lean, recline."  The original sense was "to gather the last stalks of grain left by reapers."  Over time, the meaning extended to gathering anything leftover or scattered, and eventually to gathering information or knowledge bit by bit.
