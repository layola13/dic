synonym
abiological, spontaneous generation
antonym
biogenetic

ETYMOLOGY->
From a- (not) + bio- (life) + genetic (relating to origin).  Prefix "a-" negates the "bio" part, indicating not from living organisms. The "-genetic" suffix refers to the origin or genesis.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Abiogenetic processes are still being researched. = 非生物成因的过程仍在研究中。
Some scientists believe abiogenetic formation of life is possible. = 一些科学家认为生命可能是非生物成因的。


一般过去时:
Early theories about the origin of life were often abiogenetic. = 早期关于生命起源的理论通常是非生物成因的。
Pasteur's experiments disproved the theory of spontaneous abiogenetic generation. = 巴斯德的实验证明了自然发生非生物成因理论是错误的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have proposed several abiogenetic theories. = 科学家们已经提出了几种非生物成因理论。
Research has shown that abiogenetic formation of some organic molecules is possible. = 研究表明，某些有机分子的非生物形成是可能的。


过去完成时:
Before modern science, many people had believed in abiogenetic generation of life. = 在现代科学出现之前，许多人相信生命是非生物成因的。
Scientists had considered various abiogenetic explanations for the origin of life. = 科学家们曾考虑过各种关于生命起源的非生物成因解释。


将来时:
Further research will explore abiogenetic possibilities. = 进一步的研究将探索非生物成因的可能性。
New discoveries may shed light on abiogenetic processes. = 新发现可能会阐明非生物成因的过程。


虚拟语气:
If abiogenesis were proven, it would revolutionize our understanding of life. = 如果非生物成因被证明，它将彻底改变我们对生命的理解。
If scientists could create life abiogenetically, it would be a major breakthrough. = 如果科学家能够非生物地创造生命，那将是一个重大突破。


被动语态:
Abiogenetic theories are often debated. = 非生物成因理论经常被争论。
Abiogenetic formation of organic molecules was demonstrated in the Miller-Urey experiment. = 米勒-尤里实验中证明了有机分子的非生物形成。



否定句:
The origin of life is not necessarily abiogenetic. = 生命的起源不一定是非生物成因的。
Many scientists do not believe in spontaneous abiogenetic generation. = 许多科学家不相信自然发生非生物成因。


疑问句:
Is abiogenesis a plausible explanation for the origin of life? = 非生物成因是生命起源的合理解释吗？
Are there any convincing proofs of abiogenetic formation of life? = 有没有令人信服的证据证明生命是非生物成因的？


PHRASE->
abiogenetic origin = 非生物成因起源
abiogenetic process = 非生物成因过程
abiogenetic theory = 非生物成因理论
abiogenetic synthesis = 非生物合成
abiogenetic formation = 非生物形成
