adjective
过度氧化的

近义词: overoxygenated, hyperoxidized
反义词: reduced, underoxidized
词性: adjective

词源:
"over-" (prefix) + "oxidized" (past participle of "oxidize")
"over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, beyond, excessively."
"oxidize" comes from French "oxyder," ultimately from Greek "oxys" (sharp, acid) + "-ize" (verb-forming suffix).
