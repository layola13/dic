ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *ichneumonem (nominative ichneumon), from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, “tracker, hunter”), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, “track, footprint”).  The original reference was to the Egyptian mongoose, believed to hunt crocodiles by finding their eggs. The name was later applied to the wasp due to its parasitic behavior.
