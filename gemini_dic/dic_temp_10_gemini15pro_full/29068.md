ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "carve" (Old English *ceorfan, meaning "to cut") and the adverb/preposition "up" (Old English *up, meaning "upwards, above").  The combined meaning evolved to represent the act of cutting something into pieces, and later, figuratively, to dividing something amongst several parties.
