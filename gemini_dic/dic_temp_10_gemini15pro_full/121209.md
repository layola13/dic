词源:  "mis-" (prefix meaning wrong, bad, or wrongly) + "edition" (a particular form or version of a published text).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old French "mes-" from a Germanic source. "Edition" comes from the Old French "edicion" ultimately from Latin "editionem" meaning "a bringing forth, publishing".
