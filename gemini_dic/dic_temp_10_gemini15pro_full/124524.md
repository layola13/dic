Etymology:
From mountaineer + -ed.  "Mountaineer" comes from mountain + -eer. "Mountain" ultimately derives from the Latin word "mons" (meaning "mountain").  The suffix "-eer" indicates a person who engages in a particular activity, often related to a place. The "-ed" suffix forms the past tense and past participle of regular verbs.
