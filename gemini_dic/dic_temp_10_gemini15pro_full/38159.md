PHRASE->
be comprised of = 由...组成
comprise of (虽然常用，但被认为不规范) = 由...组成
comprise the whole of = 包括全部
what comprises = 什么组成
largely comprised of = 主要由...组成

注意事项:

comprise 的用法常常引起争议。传统上，它被认为与 consist of 同义，但不能用于被动语态，也不能接of。 然而，在现代英语中，被动语态和接of 的用法越来越普遍，尤其是在美式英语中。 尽管如此，一些语法学家仍然认为这种用法不规范。  为了避免争议，最好使用 consist of 或 be composed of。
