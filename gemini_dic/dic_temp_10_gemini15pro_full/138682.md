词源:  "Nugify" is a neologism (a newly coined word) derived from "nug," a slang term for a high-quality bud of cannabis, and the suffix "-ify," which means "to make or become."  Therefore, "nugify" means to transform something into a form resembling a cannabis nug, often implying a process of concentration or solidification.
