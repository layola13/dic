Etymology:
fancy (n.) + monger (n.)

fancy (n.): from Old French fantasie "fantasy, imagination," from Latin phantasia "imagination, appearance, phantom," from Greek phantasia "a making visible, a showing forth; power of perception, imagination, image, phantom," from phant-, stem of phainein "to show, to appear."

monger (n.): from Old English mangere "merchant, trader," from Proto-Germanic *mangari (source also of Old Saxon mangari, Old Norse mangari, Dutch mangelaar, Old High German mangari, German Händler "dealer, trader"), from *manga "crowd, multitude" (see among). Originally neutral, acquired a derogatory sense of "dealer in a specific commodity" (especially disreputable ones) by late 14c.
