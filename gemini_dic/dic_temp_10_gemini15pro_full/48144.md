词源:  "De-" (down, away from) + "colling" (likely a back-formation from "decollation," meaning beheading or severing).  While the etymological connection to "decollation" is tenuous, the sense of separation or removal is retained.  The word is not commonly used and might be considered jargon specific to certain industries or contexts.  "Peeling" or "flaking" are more frequently used synonyms.
