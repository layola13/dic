nitrocalcite:/ˌnaɪtroʊˈkælsaɪt/| n. |硝酸钙|A mineral consisting of hydrous calcium nitrate, typically occurring as an efflorescence in dry sheltered places. It is also known as *nitrocalcium*.|Example 1: Nitrocalcite was found in the cave walls. 在洞穴壁上发现了硝酸钙。

Example 2: The sample was identified as nitrocalcite due to its chemical composition.  由于其化学成分，该样品被鉴定为硝酸钙。|近义词: nitrocalcium|反义词: None|词性: noun


Etymology:

nitro- (from Greek *nitron*, "natron," a naturally occurring mixture of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate) + -calcite (from Latin *calx*, "lime," referring to calcium carbonate)
