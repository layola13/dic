ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fitt (“a struggle, fight, conflict”), from Proto-Germanic *fitją (“a conflict, battle”), related to Old Norse fit (“web, woven material”), and Old English feohte (“fight”). The sense development is from "a brief struggle or bout of activity" to "a paroxysm" to "a brief period of something". The plural form "fitfulnesses" is derived by adding the suffix "-ness" to form the noun "fitfulness", and then adding "-es" to form the plural.
