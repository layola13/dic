ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fēond (attested only in compounds), from Proto-Germanic *fijandaz (“enemy, hater”), from Proto-Indo-European *pi-ḱey- (“to despise, hate”). Cognate with Old Saxon fīund (“enemy”), Old Frisian fiand, Old High German fīant (“enemy”), Old Norse fjandi (“enemy”), Gothic fijands (“enemy”). More at foe.  The sense development from “enemy, the Devil” to “cruel person” to “addict” occurred in Middle English.
