注意事项:  "Nonimmigrations" (plural) is grammatically correct but rarely used.  "Nonimmigration" (singular, abstract noun) or "nonimmigrant" (adjective/noun referring to a person) are much more common.  Therefore, the examples and explanations above primarily focus on the more common usage of "nonimmigration."
