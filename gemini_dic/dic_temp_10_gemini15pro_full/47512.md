词源: Old English *dēore "precious, valuable; noble, glorious," from Proto-Germanic *deurijaz (source also of Old Saxon diuri, Old Frisian diere, Old Norse dýrr, Dutch duur, Old High German tiuri, German teuer "dear, expensive," Gothic dius "dear, costly"), from PIE root *dew- (2) "to fail, lack." The sense development in Germanic seems to have been from "highly valued" to "costing much."


注意事项: "Dear" can be used as both an adjective and a noun.  As an adjective, it can mean "loved and valued" or "expensive." As a noun, it refers to a person who is loved.  The context usually makes the meaning clear.
