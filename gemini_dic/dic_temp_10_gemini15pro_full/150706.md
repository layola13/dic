parabola:/pəˈræbələ/ (US), /pəˈræbələ/ (UK)| n. |抛物线|A symmetrical open plane curve formed by the intersection of a cone with a plane parallel to its side.  The path of a projectile under the influence of gravity ideally follows a parabolic curve.|The ball followed a parabola through the air.  球在空中划出一道抛物线。|近义词: quadratic curve |反义词: (No direct antonym for a geometric shape) |词性: noun
Etymology: From Late Latin *parabola, from Greek parabolē "application, comparison, parable," from paraballein "to throw beside, compare," from para- "beside" + ballein "to throw."  Originally a geometrical term, referring to the application of areas, before being used for the specific curve.
