词源:
From Middle English *makerel, from Old North French maquerel, from Old Dutch *makrel.  Ultimately of uncertain origin. One suggestion connects it to  macre, "lean, thin," referring to the fish's shape. Another suggests a connection to  maquereau ("pimp"), due to the fish's supposed role in attracting other fish, though this is less likely.
