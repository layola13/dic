adverb
贬低地，轻蔑地

近义词: critically, disapprovingly, scornfully, contemptuously
反义词: approvingly, admiringly, praisingly
词性: adverb

Etymology:
From dispraise + -ing + -ly.  Dispraise itself comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and "praise".  The "-ing" creates a present participle, which is then transformed into an adverb by the addition of "-ly".
