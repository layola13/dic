laterality: /ˌlætəˈrælɪti/ | n. | 侧性；偏侧性；单侧性 | The preference for using one side of the body, such as the hand or foot, over the other.  This dominance of one side is often referred to as "handedness" (when referring to hand preference) or "footedness" (when referring to foot preference). It can also refer to the specialization of functions in the two hemispheres of the brain. |  Example:  Studies have shown a correlation between laterality and language development. 研究表明，侧性和语言发展之间存在相关性。

Example:  The patient exhibited left laterality, preferring to use his left hand for most tasks.  病人表现出左侧性，喜欢用左手完成大多数任务。 | Near synonyms: dominance, asymmetry, handedness, footedness | Antonym: symmetry | noun
