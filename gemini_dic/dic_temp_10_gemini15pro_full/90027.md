hosen's:/ˈhoʊzənz/| n.|长袜，软管（hose的复数形式，古语）|These are my hosen's.|例句：Thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach. And they shall have coats of fine linen, and bonnets of fine linen, and girdles of fine twined linen. These are holy garments; therefore they shall put them on when they go in unto the holy place. (Exodus 28:42-43 KJV)  你要给他们作细麻布裤子，遮掩下体；裤子当从腰达到大腿。亚伦和他的儿子们，每逢进圣所，或亲近圣坛，在圣处供职，给耶和华献火祭的时候，必穿上细麻布的内袍和细麻布的裹头巾，并细麻布的腰带。这都要作为圣服，免得担罪。|近义词：hose, stockings, breeches (in Biblical context)|反义词: (None, archaic word with no direct opposite)|词性:名词
