ETYMOLOGY->
From chintz (a brightly printed and glazed cotton fabric, often of low quality) + -iness (suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  The word "chintz" itself comes from Hindi "chīṅṭ", from Sanskrit "chitra" meaning "brightly colored" or "variegated". The association with cheapness likely arose from the mass production and widespread availability of chintz, leading to its use in less expensive goods.
