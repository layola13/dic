ETYMOLOGY->
From advertise + -ing + -s.  "Advertise" comes from Old French "advertiss-" meaning "to warn, to inform," ultimately from Latin "advertere"  "to turn towards."  The "-ing" suffix creates a noun form indicating the act or process of advertising. The "-s" ending is unusual and makes the noun plural when the singular "advertising" is already commonly used as a mass noun.

USAGE->
"Advertisings" is not standard English. While grammatically possible to form, it is rarely used and considered awkward.  It's much more common and natural to use "advertising" as a mass noun, or to refer to specific advertising campaigns or instances of advertising.  Therefore, examples below demonstrate the correct usage of "advertising":

一般现在时:
Advertising is essential for most businesses. = 广告对于大多数企业来说至关重要。
Their advertising targets a young demographic. = 他们的广告针对的是年轻人群。

一般过去时:
The company's advertising last year was very effective. = 这家公司去年的广告非常有效。
They spent millions on advertising during the Super Bowl. = 他们在超级碗期间花费了数百万美元做广告。

现在完成时:
Our advertising has generated a lot of interest in the product. = 我们的广告引起了人们对该产品的极大兴趣。
She has been working in advertising for ten years. = 她从事广告行业已有十年。

过去完成时:
They had finished the advertising campaign before the product launch. = 他们在产品发布前完成了广告宣传活动。
He had worked in advertising before becoming a writer. = 他在成为作家之前从事过广告工作。

将来时:
We will be increasing our advertising budget next year. = 我们明年将增加广告预算。
The new advertising campaign will start next month. = 新的广告活动将于下个月开始。


PHRASE-> (These phrases use "advertising" not "advertisings")
false advertising = 虚假广告
advertising agency = 广告公司
advertising campaign = 广告活动
advertising revenue = 广告收入
advertising standards = 广告标准



注意事项:

Avoid using "advertisings."  Use "advertising" instead.

"Advertising" can be both a noun and an adjective.
