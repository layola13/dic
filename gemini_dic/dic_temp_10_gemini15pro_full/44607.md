ETYMOLOGY->
crowd (n.) + surf (v.)
"crowd" (n.) Old English *crūd "press, throng," from Proto-Germanic *kruth- (source also of Old Frisian krud "crowd, multitude," Middle Dutch crode "crowd, lump, clod," Old High German krut "crowd, curly hair," German Kröte "toad"), from PIE root *kreut- "to bend, curve."
"surf" (v.) 1950, from surf (n.) "breaking waves," from earlier verb sense of "to ride the waves" (1883), from surf (n.) "foam of breaking waves" (1690s), perhaps a variant of surge (n.).
