The word "derworth" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name), a technical term specific to a certain field, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.
