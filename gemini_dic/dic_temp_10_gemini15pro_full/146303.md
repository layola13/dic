PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases.  Overfearfully is an adverb describing *how* an action is performed, rather than forming the basis of a phrase.)


词源： "over-" (prefix meaning "excessively") + "fearfully" (adverb from "fearful").  "Fearful" comes from Old English "fǣrful," meaning "full of fear."
