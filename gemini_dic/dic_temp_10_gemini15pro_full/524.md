From Middle French abominable, from Late Latin abominabilis "deserving of abhorrence," from Latin abominari "deprecate as an ill omen, shudder at, detest," from ab- "away" (see ab-) + ominari "predict, foretell," related to omen (n.).  The sense evolution is from "abominated, detested (by the gods)" to simply "detestable."
