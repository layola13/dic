hyperalkalinities:/ˌhaɪpərˌælkəˈlɪnɪtiz/
|n.| 超碱性（复数）|The state of being excessively alkaline, characterized by a pH significantly above 7, typically above 10.  This often occurs in environments rich in carbonate minerals.|
例句：The hyperalkalinities of certain soda lakes support unique microbial communities.  某些碱湖的超碱性支持着独特的微生物群落。

例句：Researchers are studying the hyperalkalinities of these soils to understand their impact on plant growth.  研究人员正在研究这些土壤的超碱性，以了解它们对植物生长的影响。
|近义词：extreme alkalinity, high alkalinity|反义词：acidity, low alkalinity|词性：名词


Etymology:
hyper- (prefix): from Greek "hyper," meaning "over, above, beyond"
alkali: from Arabic "al-qalīy," meaning "ashes of saltwort" (a plant used to produce soda ash)
-ity (suffix): forms nouns indicating a state or quality
-ies (suffix): plural form
