PHRASE->
There is no common English phrase using "laasha" due to it being a loanword with limited usage.  Since it means "corpse," phrases relating to the handling or discovery of a body would be more appropriate.  For example, "discovering the laasha," "examining the laasha," or "preparing the laasha for burial."  These are descriptive phrases rather than set idioms.


注意事项:  As noted, "laasha" is not a common English word.  While understandable in context, using synonyms like "corpse," "body," or "remains" would be more natural in English communication.
