Etymology:

From the late 16th century.  From concert + -ed + -ness.  Ultimately from Latin *concertare*, frequentative of *concernere* "to mix, mingle, join," from *com-* "together" + *cernere* "to sift, separate, distinguish."  The sense development moved from "striving together" to "arranged by agreement."
