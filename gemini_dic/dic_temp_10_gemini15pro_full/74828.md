ETYMOLOGY->
From the Late Latin *freneticus*, from Latin phreneticus (“frantic, delirious”), from Ancient Greek φρενητικός (phrenētikós, “of or belonging to the diaphragm, phrenitic”), from φρήν (phrḗn, “midriff, diaphragm; mind, heart, wit”).  The notion is that disorders of the diaphragm were believed to cause delirium or frenzy.  The spelling was influenced by French frénétique.
