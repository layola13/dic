PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Passionlessly" is generally not used in set phrases. It’s an adverb modifying a verb, describing *how* something is done.  Therefore, it's less likely to appear in fixed expressions.

词源: From "passionless" + "-ly." "Passionless" comes from "passion" (from Old French "passion" and ultimately Latin "passio" suffering) + "-less" (meaning without).
