noun
Lymail (likely a proper noun or brand name)
Lymail appears to be a coined word or a proper noun, possibly a brand name or a username. There isn't a standard English definition for it.  It might be a combination of "ly" (a suffix often used to form adverbs) and "mail" (referring to postal service or electronic mail). Without more context, its meaning remains speculative.
