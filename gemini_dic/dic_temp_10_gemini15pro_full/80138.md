注意事项:

"Gochi" itself doesn't have a direct English equivalent that captures the cultural nuance.  It's best understood within the context of Japanese hospitality and appreciation for a good meal.  While "feast" and "banquet" are close, they lack the specific expression of gratitude inherent in "gochi."  Using "delicious meal" is often a good substitute, especially when paired with an expression of thanks.  The word itself is borrowed from Japanese.
