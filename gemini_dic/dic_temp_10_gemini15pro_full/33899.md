circumvection:/ˌsɜːrkəmˈvekʃən/| n. |环流，循环|The process of heat transfer through the movement of fluids, especially in a circular or cyclical pattern.  It's like a natural convection current, but often on a larger scale, like in the Earth's mantle or the Sun's atmosphere.|Magma undergoes circumvection in the Earth's mantle.  地球的地幔中，岩浆进行着环流。

The circumvection of air in the room helped distribute the heat from the fireplace. 房间里空气的环流帮助分散了壁炉的热量。|近义词：circulation, convection|反义词: stagnation|词性:noun
