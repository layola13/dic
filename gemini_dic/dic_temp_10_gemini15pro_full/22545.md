ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *bore*, *boor*, from Dutch *boer* (“farmer, peasant”), from Proto-Germanic *būraz* (“inhabitant, dweller”). Cognate with German *Bauer* (“farmer”). The meaning shifted from "peasant" to "rude person" over time, likely due to societal prejudices against rural populations.
