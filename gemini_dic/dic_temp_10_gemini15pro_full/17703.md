ETYMOLOGY->
From be- + dazzle.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "thoroughly" or "completely." "Dazzle" comes from the Middle English "dasen," meaning "to grow dim," paradoxically.  Over time, it shifted to mean "to overwhelm with brightness."  Therefore, "bedazzle" literally means "to completely overwhelm with brightness."
