nontractabilities:/ˌnɒntrækˈtæbɪlɪtiz/ | n. | 不可处理性，棘手性 |  The quality or state of being intractable; difficulty in handling or dealing with.  This refers to problems, especially in computing, that are computationally too complex to be solved efficiently. | The nontractabilities of the problem led the researchers to abandon the project.  这个问题的不可处理性导致研究人员放弃了该项目。 | Synonyms: insolubilities, difficulties, complexities, impasses | Antonyms: solvability, easiness, simplicity | Noun


Etymology:

* non-: Prefix meaning "not." From Latin *non*.
* tractable:  From Late Latin *tractabilis*, from Latin *tractare* "to handle, manage," frequentative of *trahere* "to draw, drag."
* -ity: Suffix forming nouns of quality or state. From Latin *-itas*.
* -ies: Plural suffix.
