The word "femerell" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, providing a standard lexical analysis is impossible.  If you meant a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to assist.

If you are interested in exploring how new words are formed and enter the lexicon, I can provide information on neologisms and word formation processes in English.  Just let me know.
