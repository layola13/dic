词源:
From non- + subjectively, where subjective comes from Late Middle English: from late Latin subjectivus, from subject- ‘brought under,’ from the verb subicere (see subject). The original sense was ‘existing in the mind; belonging to the thinking subject rather than to the object of thought’ (compare with objective).
