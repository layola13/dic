词源: From Middle English *choghe, *choȝe, from Old English *ceo, *ceoh (“chough”), from Proto-Germanic *kawwǭ (“jackdaw, chough”). Cognate with West Frisian kauw (“jackdaw”), Dutch kauw (“jackdaw”), German kauen (“to chew”), Old Norse ká (“jackdaw”).  The word's original meaning referred to various crow-like birds, and the specific application to the red-billed chough developed later.
