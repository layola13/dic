词源：
fair (adj.): From Old English fæger "beautiful, pleasing, fitting, proper," from Proto-Germanic *fagraz (source also of Old Norse fagr "fair, beautiful," Old Saxon fagar, Old High German fagar, Gothic fagrs "fit, suitable"), from PIE *pek- "to adorn." The sense development from "beautiful" to "morally pure" to "just, equitable" is paralleled in many languages.
