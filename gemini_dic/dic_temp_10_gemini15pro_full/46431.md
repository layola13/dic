词源:
"Daggy" originated in Australian and New Zealand slang.  While its exact etymology is uncertain, it may be related to the word "dag," referring to dried clumps of sheep droppings, implying something unkempt or undesirable. Over time, the meaning softened, and "daggy" now often carries an affectionate connotation.
