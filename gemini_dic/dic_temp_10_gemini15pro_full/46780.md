**Note:**  "Danging" appears to be a misspelling of "dangling", which means hanging loosely or precariously.  While "danging" may occasionally appear online, it is not a standard English word. The analysis above assumes the intended word was "dangling" and uses the correct spelling throughout.  If "danging" was indeed intended, its meaning would likely be interpreted as "dangerous" based on context.
