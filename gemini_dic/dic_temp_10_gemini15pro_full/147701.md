overprecision:/ˌoʊvərprɪˈsɪʒən/| n.| 过度精确; 过于精确|The overprecision in the measurements led to unnecessary complications. 测量中过分的精确导致了不必要的复杂化。|例句：The overprecision of the data can sometimes obscure the bigger picture.  数据过于精确有时会掩盖全局。

The overprecision in her calculations made the process much longer than it needed to be. 她计算中过分的精确使得这个过程比它实际需要的长得多。|近义词：excessive precision, over-accuracy|反义词:imprecision, inaccuracy|词性:名词

Etymology:  "over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi "over, above, beyond") + "precision" (from Latin praecisio "a cutting off in front, curtailment," from praecidere "to cut off in front," from prae "before" + caedere "to cut").
