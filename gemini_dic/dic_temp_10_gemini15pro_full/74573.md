"Frauhola" isn't a recognized word in English or in any common language.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word). Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "Fraulein," which sounds similar, here's the analysis:


Fräulein: /ˈfrɔɪlaɪn/ (Americanized pronunciation) /ˈfrɔɪlɑɪn/ (closer to German pronunciation)
Fräulein: | n. | 小姐； (尤指未婚女子) |  A German word formerly used as a courtesy title for an unmarried woman. |  The landlady addressed her as "Fräulein Schmidt." 女房东称呼她为“施密特小姐”。 | Near Synonyms: Miss, Ms. | Antonym:  Frau (married woman) | Noun

Note:  The use of "Fräulein" is largely outdated and considered by some to be sexist. It is rarely used in modern German.  "Frau" is now the standard polite form of address for women, regardless of marital status.
