词源:  "nonseriousness" and "nonseriousnesses" are formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "seriousness." "Seriousness" comes from the Middle English "seriosnesse," derived from Old French "serieus," ultimately from Latin "serius" meaning "grave," "weighty," or "important."  The plural form "nonseriousnesses" is less common but grammatically correct.
