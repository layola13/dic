becquerel: /ˈbɛkərɛl/ | n. | 贝克勒尔 |  A unit of radioactivity, equal to one disintegration per second. It is named after Henri Becquerel, a French physicist who discovered radioactivity. | The banana has a radioactivity of about 0.1 becquerel per gram.  一根香蕉的放射性约为每克0.1贝克勒尔。| The sample emitted 100 becquerels. 样本放射出100贝克勒尔。 | synonym: Bq (abbreviation), unit of radioactivity | antonym:  (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement, but perhaps "inert," "stable," or "non-radioactive" could be considered conceptually opposite) | noun
