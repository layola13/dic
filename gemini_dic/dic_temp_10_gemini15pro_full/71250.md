注意事项:

Since "fiu" is an interjection, its usage is limited and primarily expressive. It is unlikely to be found in complex grammatical structures.  Its primary function is to convey disgust or contempt.  While it can be modified by adverbs (e.g., "He went 'fiu' loudly"), it rarely forms the core of a phrase.
