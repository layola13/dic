一般过去时 (Simple Past):

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
While we were eating, they were going to the park. (我们吃饭的时候，他们正要去公园).  -  Terwijl wij aan het eten waren, gingen zij naar het park. (This translates more literally to the English structure but using "gingen" implies a completed action within the ongoing action of eating.)
While I was studying, they were going home. (我学习的时候，他们正要回家). -  Terwijl ik aan het studeren was, gingen zij naar huis. (Similar to the above, using "gingen" implies a completed action within the ongoing action of studying.)
(It's important to note that while a direct translation might use "gingen", the nuance is different. Dutch often uses the past tense where English uses the past continuous to describe a shorter action within a longer ongoing action in the past.)



过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
(Difficult to create a natural sentence with "gingen" and past perfect.  Dutch usually prefers other constructions. An example using a different verb to illustrate past perfect is:  Voordat ik aankwam, waren ze al vertrokken. (Before I arrived, they had already left.))



过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
(Not applicable to "gingen" in a natural way due to the nature of the verb and tense.)

PHRASE->
(Phrases with "gingen" are generally just the verb used in context. It's not part of set idiomatic phrases like some English verbs.)

注意事项:
"Gingen" is specifically Dutch.  There is no direct English equivalent single word.  The translation depends on the context.


Since "gingen" is a conjugated verb form (past tense plural), it doesn't fit neatly into all the English tense categories. The examples given illustrate its primary use in the simple past tense.  The past continuous examples demonstrate the nuance of how Dutch uses the simple past where English might use the past continuous.  Forcing it into other tenses would result in unnatural Dutch sentences.
