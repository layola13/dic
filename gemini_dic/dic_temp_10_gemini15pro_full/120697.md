ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + advising (present participle of advise).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, astray," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-",  ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*mei-" (to change, go, move). "Advise" comes from Old French "aviser"  (to consider, deliberate, inform), from Vulgar Latin "*advisare," from Latin "ad" (to) + "visum," past participle of "videre" (to see).
