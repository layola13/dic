ellipticity:/ɪˌlɪpˈtɪsɪti/| n.|椭圆度，椭率|The deviation of an ellipse from circularity; the amount by which an ellipse is flattened.  It is expressed as the ratio (a-b)/a, where a is the semimajor axis and b is the semiminor axis.|The ellipticity of the Earth's orbit is small, meaning it's almost a perfect circle.|Synonyms: eccentricity, oblateness|Antonyms: circularity|noun
