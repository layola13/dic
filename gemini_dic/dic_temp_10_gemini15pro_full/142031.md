organogenic:/ˌɔːrɡənəˈdʒɛnɪk/
adjective
器官生成的; 器官形成的
Relating to or causing the formation of organs.
例句：Organogenic differentiation is crucial during embryonic development.  器官发生分化在胚胎发育过程中至关重要。

例句：The researchers studied the organogenic potential of stem cells. 研究人员研究了干细胞的器官生成潜能。
近义词：organ-forming, organogenetic
反义词：N/A
词性：adjective

Etymology:  From organo- + -genic.  "Organo-" ultimately derives from Greek *órganon* meaning "instrument, tool, organ". "-genic" comes from Greek *-genēs*  meaning "producing, produced."
