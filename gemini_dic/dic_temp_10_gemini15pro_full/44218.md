注意事项:

The word "crock's" in this context is almost exclusively used in the vulgar phrase "crock of shit."  Using "crock's" with other nouns to avoid the vulgarity is not standard English and would sound unnatural.  The examples provided are for illustrative purposes only and are not recommended for everyday conversation.  It's much better and clearer to use established synonyms like "nonsense," "rubbish," or "lies."
