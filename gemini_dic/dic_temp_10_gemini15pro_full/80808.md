词源:

"Gothicly" is derived from the word "Gothic," ultimately stemming from the Goths, an East Germanic people.  The term was initially used pejoratively during the Renaissance to describe what was considered a barbaric style of medieval architecture.  Later, it came to denote the specific architectural style of the 12th-14th centuries, characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, and subsequently extended to literature, art, and other cultural forms sharing similar aesthetic qualities.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "Gothic" into an adverb.
