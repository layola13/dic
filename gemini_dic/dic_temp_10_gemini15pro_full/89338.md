homography:/hɒˈmɒɡrəfi/ | n. |单应性，单应变换|A transformation that maps points from one plane to another, typically used in computer vision to relate images of the same scene from different viewpoints.  It is a projective transformation that preserves straight lines. |Example 1: The homography between the two images allowed us to stitch them together seamlessly. 两幅图像之间的单应性使我们能够将它们无缝地拼接在一起。

Example 2:  We used homography estimation to correct the perspective distortion in the aerial photograph. 我们使用单应性估计来校正航拍照片中的透视失真。|近义词:projective transformation, collineation |反义词: N/A |词性:noun

Etymology: From Greek "homos" (same) + "graphe" (writing).
