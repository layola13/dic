backtrackers:/ˈbækˌtrækərz/| n.|回溯者；回溯算法|People or algorithms that backtrack, often used in computer science to describe algorithms that explore possible solutions by trying out different paths and returning to a previous point if a path proves unsuccessful.  A backtracker might also refer to someone who retraces their steps, literally or figuratively.|The algorithm uses backtrackers to find the solution.|近义词：search algorithms, problem solvers|反义词: N/A|noun
