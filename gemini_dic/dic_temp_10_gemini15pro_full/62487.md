endosternite:/ˈɛndoʊstɜːrnaɪt/
n.|内骨骼|An internal skeletal structure, usually composed of chitinous material, found in some arthropods, particularly in the thorax of certain insects. It serves as an attachment point for muscles.|The dragonfly's powerful flight muscles are anchored to its endosternite.|近义词:apodeme|反义词:exoskeleton|词性:noun
