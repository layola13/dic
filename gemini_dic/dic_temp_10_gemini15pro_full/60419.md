eighthest: /ˈeɪtθɪst/ (This word is likely a misspelling or non-standard form) | adj. | 第八 (Intended meaning, but incorrect form) | This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an attempt to form a superlative adjective meaning "eighth-est," perhaps intending to express something like "most definitively eighth" or "in the strongest sense of being eighth."  Standard English lacks this construction.  The proper way to express the eighth item in a sequence is simply "eighth." |  (No valid example sentence as this word is not standard English) | Near synonyms (for "eighth"): eighth | Antonyms (for "eighth"): first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, etc. | adjective
