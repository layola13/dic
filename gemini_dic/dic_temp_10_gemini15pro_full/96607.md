inductrical:  This word appears to be a misspelling.  It's likely intended to be "electrical" or "inductive."  I'll analyze both possibilities.

**Assuming the intended word is "electrical":**

electrical: /ɪˈlɛktrɪk(ə)l/
adjective
电的; 与电有关的
relating to electricity; carrying or operated by electricity
例句：Electrical appliances make our lives easier.  电器使我们的生活更便捷。

例句：The electrical system in the old house needs to be updated.  老房子的电路系统需要更新。


近义词: electronic, powered
反义词: nonelectrical, manual


词性: adjective


**Assuming the intended word is "inductive":**

inductive: /ɪnˈdʌktɪv/
adjective
归纳的; 感应的
1. characterized by the inference of general laws from particular instances.
2. relating to or caused by electric or magnetic induction.

例句：Inductive reasoning is a key part of scientific inquiry. 归纳推理是科学探究的关键部分。

近义词: inferred, reasoned
反义词: deductive
