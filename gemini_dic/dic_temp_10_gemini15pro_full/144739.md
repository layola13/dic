over-aptness's: /ˌoʊvərˈæptnəsɪz/ | n. | 过分恰当; 过于贴切 | The over-aptness's of the metaphor made it seem contrived.  这个比喻过于贴切，反而显得做作。 |  English Explanation:  The noun form of "over-apt", referring to the state or quality of being excessively suitable or pertinent, often to the point of seeming artificial or forced.  It's formed by adding the suffix "-ness" to "over-apt" and then the possessive 's.  While grammatically correct, it's an uncommon and awkward construction. Using "over-aptness" without the possessive would generally be preferred. | Example:  The over-aptness's of his reply made her suspicious. 他回答得过于恰当，让她起了疑心。| Synonyms:  appropriateness (though not excessive), suitability, fitness, pertinence | Antonyms:  inappropriateness, unsuitability, irrelevance | Noun
