词源： "hold" comes from Old English *haldan, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch houden and German halten.  "to" is a preposition with a complex history, deriving ultimately from Proto-Germanic *to.  The combined phrase "hold-to" functions as a phrasal verb or adjective, emphasizing the act of maintaining or adhering to something.
