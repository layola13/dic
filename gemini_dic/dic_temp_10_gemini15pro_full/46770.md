ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *dangering, present participle of dangeren (“to endanger”), from Anglo-Norman dangerer, from Old French dangier (“power, jurisdiction, control; danger, peril”), from Late Latin *dominiarium (“power of a lord”), from Latin dominium (“ownership, property, dominion”), from dominus (“lord, master”).  The semantic shift from "power" to "danger" arose because being in someone's power could be dangerous.
