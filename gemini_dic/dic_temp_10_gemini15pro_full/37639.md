commutative:/kəˈmjuːtətɪv/ | adj. |交换的，可交换的|Relating to a binary operation in which changing the order of the operands does not change the result.  |例句：Addition is commutative; a + b = b + a. 加法是可交换的；a + b = b + a。 |例句：Matrix multiplication is not generally commutative; AB ≠ BA. 矩阵乘法通常不可交换；AB ≠ BA. |近义词：interchangeable, permutable|反义词：noncommutative, non-interchangeable|词性:形容词

Etymology:
From Late Latin *commutativus, from Latin commutare "to change thoroughly, exchange," from com- "together" + mutare "to change."
