ETYMOLOGY->
From acquaintedness + -'s (possessive suffix). Acquaintedness is derived from acquainted, the past participle of the verb acquaint, which comes from Old French acointier "to make known," from Vulgar Latin *accognitare, frequentative of Latin cognoscere "to get to know, learn."

USAGE->
There are limited grammatical contexts for "acquaintedness's" due to its infrequent usage and somewhat awkward construction. It's primarily used to express possession related to the abstract concept of acquaintedness.

Possessive usage:

The depth of their acquaintedness's impact surprised everyone. = 他们熟识程度的深刻影响让每个人都感到惊讶。
The lawyer questioned the witness about the nature of the acquaintedness's development. = 律师询问了证人关于这种熟识关系发展性质的问题。


PHRASE->
Due to its low frequency of use, "acquaintedness's" does not appear in common phrases. It's more natural to rephrase sentences using synonyms of "acquaintedness" like "familiarity" or "intimacy" and their possessive forms. For example, instead of "the acquaintedness's depth," one would say "the depth of their familiarity."
