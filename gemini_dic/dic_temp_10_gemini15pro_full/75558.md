词性:adjective

词源: "Fuckier" is a comparative adjective derived from the vulgar slang term "fucked," which itself is the past participle of the verb "fuck."  While the original verb has sexual connotations, its past participle has taken on a wider range of meanings related to damage, malfunction, or a generally negative state.  The "-ier" suffix is a standard English comparative form, indicating a greater degree of the quality being described.

用法说明:
"Fuckier" is highly informal and vulgar.  It should be avoided in formal settings and professional communication.  Its usage is generally confined to casual conversations among close friends or in situations where strong emotional expression is acceptable. Due to its offensive nature, careful consideration should be given to the context and audience before using this word.
