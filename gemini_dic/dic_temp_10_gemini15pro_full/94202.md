imperdibility:/ˌɪmpərdibɪləti/ | n. | 不可信性；难以置信 | The imperdibility of his story made it hard to believe. |  His claims had an air of imperdibility about them. | 近义词: incredibility, unbelievability | 反义词: credibility, believability | 词性: 名词

Etymology: From Late Latin *imperdibilis, from in- "not" + perdibilis "that can be lost, destructible," from perdere "to lose, destroy" (from per- "through" + dare "to give"). The English word "imperdibility" is derived by adding the suffix "-ity" (meaning "state or quality of") to the adjective "imperdible," meaning "not liable to be lost or destroyed." Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the sense of "unbelievable" or "incredible."
