ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *adḗn* (gland) + *-algia* (pain).

USAGE->
While "adenalgy" is a correctly formed medical term, it's not commonly used in everyday conversation or even frequently in medical settings.  More descriptive phrases like "gland pain" or "pain in the [specific gland]" are preferred. Therefore, providing usage examples in various tenses and grammatical contexts is not practical as they would sound artificial and contrived.  It's best to understand the word's meaning and etymology, and recognize that its usage is limited to specific technical contexts.

PHRASE->
(Since "adenalgy" is rarely used, it doesn't have common phrases associated with it.  Phrases would be more likely to be built around "gland pain" instead.)
