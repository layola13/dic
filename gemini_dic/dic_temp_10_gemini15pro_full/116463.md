"Matelis" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a proper noun (like a surname), a technical term in a specific field, or a word from a different language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.


However, I can demonstrate the format you requested using the word "what" as an example:
