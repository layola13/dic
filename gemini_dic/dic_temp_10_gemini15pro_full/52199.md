diastase: /ˈdaɪəsteɪs/ /ˈdaɪəsteɪz/ | n. | 淀粉酶 | An enzyme, found chiefly in germinating seeds and in the digestive juices of animals, that catalyzes the hydrolysis of starch into maltose and dextrin. | Diastase is important for the breakdown of starch in the digestive process. 淀粉酶在消化过程中对淀粉的分解很重要。| Diastase is present in saliva. 唾液中含有淀粉酶。 | synonym: amylase | antonym: (No direct antonym for a specific enzyme, but an *inhibitor* could be considered an opposing concept.) | noun
