amelcorn: /ˈeɪməlkɔːrn/ | n. | 独角兽（amelcorn 并非一个正式的英语单词，可能是 alicorn 的拼写错误。） | A mythical horse-like creature with a single horn on its forehead.

Here's an example using the likely intended word, alicorn):  The alicorn spread its wings and soared into the sky.  独角兽展开翅膀，飞向天空。 | 近义词: unicorn, alicorn (if winged) | 反义词:  None (mythical creatures generally don't have direct opposites) | 词性: Noun
