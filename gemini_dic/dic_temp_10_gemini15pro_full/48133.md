decoherer:/ˌdiːkoʊˈhɪərər/| n. |粉末检波器，退相干器|A device used in early radio receivers to detect radio waves. It consisted of a tube containing metal filings that would clump together when a radio signal was received, thus completing an electrical circuit.  The filings then had to be mechanically separated, or "decohered",  before the next signal could be received.|The old radio used a decoherer to receive signals.  老式收音机使用粉末检波器接收信号。|Synonym: detector|Antonym: N/A|noun

decohere:/ˌdiːkoʊˈhɪər/| v. | (使)失去相干性，(使量子系统)退相干|To cause a quantum system to lose its coherence, typically through interaction with its environment. Also, in older radio technology, to break the electrical connection in a coherer.|Environmental noise can decohere the quantum state. 环境噪声会使量子态退相干。|The operator had to manually decohere the receiver after each signal. 操作员必须在每个信号后手动断开接收器的连接。|Synonym: disrupt, scramble (in the quantum context)|Antonym: cohere|verb
