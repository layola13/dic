Etymology:
From Middle English *gines, plural of *gine, from Old French engin, from Latin ingenium ("inborn quality, talent; natural disposition, character; clever invention, device"), from in- ("in, within") + gignere ("to beget, produce").  The sense of "trap" developed from the meaning of "ingenious device".  The alcoholic beverage is shortened from genever, from Middle Dutch genever, ultimately from Latin juniperus, referring to the juniper berries used to flavor it.
