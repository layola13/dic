词源:  From Middle English *il sterred, from il, evil + sterred, past participle of sterren, to control by the stars, from Old English steorran; akin to Old High German stiurran to steer.  最初来自中古英语 *il sterred，由 il（邪恶的）和 sterred（sterren 的过去分词，意为“由星星控制”）组成，来源于古英语 steorran；与古高地德语 stiurran（掌舵）同源。  因此，这个词的字面意思是“受星星不利影响的”，暗示着命运的捉弄。
