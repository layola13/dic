orientability:/ˌɔːriɛntəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可定向性 | The property of a surface or manifold that allows a consistent choice of surface normal vector at every point.  A surface is orientable if a two-dimensional figure can be moved around on the surface and brought back to its starting point without its orientation being reversed. | The Möbius strip is a classic example of a non-orientable surface. 莫比乌斯带是不可定向曲面的经典例子。 | orientability is a crucial concept in topology. 可定向性是拓扑学中的一个关键概念。 | synonyms: directionality | antonyms: non-orientability | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From orient + -ability.  "Orient" comes from the Old French "orient" meaning "east," ultimately from the Latin "oriens" meaning "rising" (as in the rising sun).  The suffix "-ability" denotes the capacity or possibility of something, derived from the Latin "-abilis."
