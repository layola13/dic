词源:  "datablenesses" is a neologism formed by adding the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality) to the word "datable", which itself is formed from "data" + "-able" (indicating capability or suitability).  Therefore, it literally suggests the quality or state of being datable or the state of having characteristics related to data, but extended to encompass the concept of uncertainty or vagueness within data.
