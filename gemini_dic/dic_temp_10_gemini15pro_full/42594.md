ETYMOLOGY->
From counter- + pressure.  "Counter-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite," originating from the Old French "contre-" and ultimately the Latin "contra."  "Pressure" comes from the Old French "pression" and the Latin "pressio," meaning "a pressing."  Therefore, "counterpressure" literally means "pressure against pressure."
