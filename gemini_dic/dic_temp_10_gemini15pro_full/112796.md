注意事项:

*  "luc" is not a common English word.  It appears more as a root word (e.g., translucent, lucid).  While grammatically correct in these examples, using words like "light," "brightness," "shine," or "illuminate" would sound much more natural.
*  The provided examples use "luc" in various tenses to fulfill the prompt's requirements, but it's important to remember that using "luc" as a verb is unconventional.
