detectibility:/dɪˌtɛktəˈbɪləti/
n.|可检测性，可发现性|The detectibility of the signal is low due to background noise. 由于背景噪音，信号的可检测性很低。|例句：The new radar system boasts improved detectibility of small objects.  新的雷达系统拥有改进的小物体探测能力。

例句：The detectibility of the disease in its early stages is crucial for successful treatment.  在疾病早期阶段的可检测性对于成功治疗至关重要。

近义词：discoverability, perceptibility, visibility, observability
反义词：invisibility, undetectability, imperceptibility
词性:noun

词源: From detect + -able + -ity.  Detect comes from the Latin dētectus, past participle of dētegō (“uncover, discover”).
