ballaran: /ˈbælərən/ (This pronunciation is a best guess, as the word is not found in standard dictionaries) | n. | 舞伴，舞者 (This meaning is inferred based on context and similar words, as "ballaran" is not a recognized English word.) | A person you dance with, especially in a formal setting.  This word likely comes from a combination of "ball," referring to a formal dance, and possibly a suffix like "-eran" or "-aran" suggesting a person associated with the activity.  As it's not a standard word, its etymology is speculative. | *She chose him as her ballaran for the evening.* 她选择他作为她当晚的舞伴。 *The ballaran twirled gracefully across the dance floor.* 舞者优雅地旋转穿过舞池。 | synonym: partner, dancer | antonym:  (None, as it's not a standard word and the meaning is contextual) | noun
