注意事项:  Avoid using "ciggie's."  "Ciggies" (without the apostrophe-s) is already the informal plural.  "Ciggie's" implies possession, as if the cigarettes belong to someone or something named Ciggie.  While grammatically possible, it's highly unusual and not standard usage. Stick with "cigarettes" for formal contexts and "ciggies" for informal ones.
