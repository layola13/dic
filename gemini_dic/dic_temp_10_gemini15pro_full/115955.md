Note: The word "marrier" is less common than terms like "officiant," "celebrant," or simply using the specific title of the person performing the marriage (e.g., "priest," "judge," "minister").  While grammatically correct, its usage is relatively infrequent.  It's more likely to be encountered in older texts or in specific legal contexts.
