hypermorphic:/ˌhaɪpərˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 超形态的，超常形态的 |  Genetically referring to a mutation that causes a gene to have increased activity or expression compared to the wild-type allele, often resulting in an exaggerated phenotype. | The hypermorphic mutation resulted in an overproduction of the protein.  这个超形态突变导致蛋白质的过度生产。 | Near Synonyms: overexpressed, gain-of-function | Antonyms: hypomorphic, loss-of-function | Word Type: adjective

hypermorphic:/ˌhaɪpərˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 超形态的，超常形态的 |  In genetics, a hypermorphic allele produces a more extreme version of the wild-type phenotype. This is usually due to increased gene expression or increased activity of the gene product. | The hypermorphic phenotype was evident in the enlarged wings of the fly.  超形态表型在苍蝇扩大的翅膀中很明显。 | Near Synonyms: upregulated, intensified | Antonyms: downregulated, attenuated | Word Type: adjective
