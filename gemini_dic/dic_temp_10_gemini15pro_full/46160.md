词源: From Late Latin *cynicus, from Ancient Greek κυνικός (kunikós, “dog-like, currish”), from κύων (kúōn, “dog”).  The Cynics were a school of ancient Greek philosophers who believed that virtue was the only good and that the essence of virtue was self-control.  Their austere lifestyle and outspoken criticism of social conventions led to the modern sense of "cynical".
