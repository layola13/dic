ETYMOLOGY->
From "jigger," a tool or device used for various purposes, including pottery making.  Its origins are uncertain, but it might be related to "chig," a dialect word for a small insect or flea, perhaps referring to a small, rapidly moving tool.  The "-ing" suffix creates the present participle and gerund form of the verb. 由“jigger”一词演变而来，“jigger”是一种用于各种用途的工具或装置，包括陶器制作。它的起源不确定，但可能与方言词“chig”有关，意思是小昆虫或跳蚤，可能指的是一种快速移动的小工具。“-ing”后缀构成动词的现在分词和动名词形式。
