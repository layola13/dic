词源：
From the earlier flunkey, perhaps from Scottish Gaelic *pluinceid "footboy," from pluinc "act of jerking, kicking," or alternatively from dialectal English flunk "to fail," implying someone incompetent fit only for menial tasks. The current spelling emerged in the mid-19th century.
来自早期flunkey，可能来自苏格兰盖尔语*pluinceid“步兵”，来自pluinc“猛拉，踢的动作”，或者来自方言英语flunk“失败”，暗示某人不称职，只适合做卑微的任务。目前的拼写出现在19世纪中期。
