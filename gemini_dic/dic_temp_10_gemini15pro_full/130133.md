non-recessive:/ˌnɒn rɪˈsɛsɪv/ | adj. | 非隐性的 |  Not recessive; refers to a gene or trait that is expressed even when only one copy is present.  In other words, it dominates over a recessive gene. | Example: The gene for brown eyes is non-recessive. 棕色的眼睛基因是非隐性的。| Example:  The non-recessive allele determined the offspring's hair color. 非隐性等位基因决定了后代的头发颜色。 | Synonym: dominant | Antonym: recessive | adjective
