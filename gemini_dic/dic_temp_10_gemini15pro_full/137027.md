nonstatic:/nɒnˈstætɪk/ | adj. | 非静态的 | Not static; able to be changed or modified during the execution of a program.  In programming, it refers to members (variables or methods) of a class that are associated with specific instances of that class, rather than with the class itself. |  A nonstatic variable can have a different value for each object created from the class. | synonym: dynamic, instance | antonym: static | adjective

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Nonstatic methods access instance variables directly. = 非静态方法可以直接访问实例变量。
A nonstatic variable holds a value specific to each object. = 非静态变量保存特定于每个对象的值。


现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is accessing nonstatic members of the class. = 程序正在访问类的非静态成员。
He is using nonstatic methods to manipulate object data. = 他正在使用非静态方法来操作对象数据。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The developer has declared a nonstatic variable. = 开发人员已经声明了一个非静态变量。
We have used nonstatic methods to interact with the objects. = 我们已经使用非静态方法与对象进行交互。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been using nonstatic variables for storing object-specific data. = 程序一直在使用非静态变量来存储特定于对象的数据。
They have been working with nonstatic methods to modify object states. = 他们一直在使用非静态方法来修改对象状态。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The nonstatic method returned the value of the instance variable. = 非静态方法返回了实例变量的值。
We accessed the nonstatic variable through an object reference. = 我们通过对象引用访问了非静态变量。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was utilizing nonstatic members when the error occurred. = 错误发生时，程序正在使用非静态成员。
She was modifying a nonstatic variable when the program crashed. = 程序崩溃时，她正在修改一个非静态变量。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The object had already initialized its nonstatic variables. = 对象已经初始化了它的非静态变量。
He had used nonstatic methods before encountering the issue. = 在遇到问题之前，他已经使用了非静态方法。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been accessing nonstatic variables for several hours before the crash. = 程序在崩溃前已经访问了几个小时的非静态变量。
They had been working with nonstatic methods extensively before finding the solution. = 他们在找到解决方案之前，已经广泛地使用了非静态方法。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The nonstatic method will return the updated value. = 非静态方法将返回更新后的值。
We will use a nonstatic variable to store the result. = 我们将使用非静态变量来存储结果。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be accessing nonstatic members during the next phase. = 程序将在下一阶段访问非静态成员。
He will be using nonstatic methods to process the data. = 他将使用非静态方法来处理数据。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the week, the developer will have implemented all nonstatic methods. = 到本周末，开发人员将已经实现了所有非静态方法。
The program will have accessed all nonstatic variables by that time. = 到那时，程序将已经访问了所有非静态变量。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next year, they will have been working with nonstatic members for over a decade. = 到明年，他们使用非静态成员将超过十年。
The program will have been utilizing nonstatic variables for efficient data storage for a long time. = 程序将长期以来一直使用非静态变量来进行有效的数据存储。
