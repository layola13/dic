automorphic:/ˌɔːtəˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 自守的，自同构的 | (of a number) such that the last digits of its square (or higher power) are the same as the number itself.  A number is called automorphic if it appears at the end of its square.  Relating to or involving an automorphism. |  Example 1: 76 is an automorphic number because 76 squared is 5776.  例子1: 76是一个自守数，因为76的平方是5776。

Example 2:  The transformation is automorphic, preserving the structure of the group. 例子2: 这种变换是自守的，保留了群的结构。| Near Synonyms: self-similar, invariant | Antonyms: heteromorphic, non-invariant | word property: adjective
