assured's:/əˈʃʊrdz/ |n.|被保险人|The assured's claim was processed quickly. |被保险人的索赔得到了迅速处理. |Synonyms: insured, policyholder |Antonyms: insurer, underwriter|noun

Etymology: From the past participle of the verb *assure*, from Old French *assurer*  (to make safe, guarantee), from Latin *ad-* (to) + *securus* (secure). The '-ed' suffix forms the adjective 'assured', and the apostrophe and 's' indicate possession, thus 'assured's' meaning 'belonging to the assured person'.
