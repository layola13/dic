注意事项:
* "Chingo" is considered vulgar slang and should be avoided in formal settings. Its usage can be offensive to some people.  It's important to be mindful of your audience when using this word.  Its etymology comes from Mexican Spanish. While "chingo" literally translates to "a lot" or "much," it carries a stronger, more emphatic connotation and is often used in casual or informal conversations.


词源: 源于墨西哥西班牙语，字面意思是“很多”或“非常”。
