ETYMOLOGY->
The term "bluestocking" originated in the mid-18th century in England.  It referred to informal literary gatherings hosted by women, where learned discussions took place.  The name is believed to derive from the plain blue worsted stockings worn by botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet, a regular attendee of these gatherings, in contrast to the fashionable black silk stockings worn by men at formal occasions.  Over time, the term evolved to describe the women who participated in these intellectual circles, and later acquired a somewhat negative connotation, suggesting pretentiousness or excessive academic focus.
