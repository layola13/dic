dorsibranchiata: /ˌdɔːrsɪˈbræŋkiˌɑːtə/ (US) /ˌdɔːsɪˈbræŋkiˌeɪtə/ (UK) | n. | 背鳃类 |A subclass of Annelida (segmented worms) characterized by gills arranged along the back.  These are primarily marine worms, often with elaborate branching gills. | The dorsibranchiata, such as the fan worm, are fascinating creatures of the sea.  背鳃类动物，例如扇虫，是迷人的海洋生物。| synonym: Errantia (in some classifications), polychaete worms | antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific classification.  Could contrast with Oligochaeta - earthworms - which lack prominent gills) | noun
