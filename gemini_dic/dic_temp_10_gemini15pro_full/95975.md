ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin incumbentem (nominative incumbens), present participle of incumbere “to lie or lean upon, press upon, apply oneself to,” from in- “in, on” + -cumbere “to lie down” (related to cubare “to lie”).  The original sense was “resting or lying upon” (as a duty or responsibility), later evolving to “holding a position.”
