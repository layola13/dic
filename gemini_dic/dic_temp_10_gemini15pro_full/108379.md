PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in phrases. It's more of a formal word used in specific contexts.)


注意事项:
"Law-abidingnesses" is grammatically correct, but it is an uncommon and somewhat awkward plural form. "Law-abidingness" (singular) is much more frequently used.  It's generally preferable to use the singular form unless specifically referring to multiple distinct instances of the quality of being law-abiding in different groups or contexts.
