Etymology: From the Old French *desveloper, meaning "to unwrap, unfold," from the prefix des- (meaning "un-") and the verb voloper "to wrap."  This evolved into the Middle English develupen, and ultimately the modern English "develop." The suffix "-ment" turns the verb into a noun, signifying the result or process of developing.
