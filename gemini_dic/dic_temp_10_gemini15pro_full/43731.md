ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *crike, from Old Norse *krykja ("bend, hook, corner"), from Proto-Germanic *krukjō ("hook, curve"), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)ker- ("to turn, bend").  Cognate with Dutch kreek ("creek, inlet") and German Kreis ("circle, district").  The sense of "small stream" likely developed from the winding nature of creeks.
