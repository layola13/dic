ETYMOLOGY->
The word "nylon" is a genericized trademark coined by DuPont. Its origin is shrouded in some mystery, with theories ranging from an acronym of "New York-London" (disputed by DuPont) to a deliberate nonsense word.  Most likely, it's a modification of "no-run" (referring to stockings) with the "-on" suffix common in fiber names (like rayon and cotton).
