The word "goset" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term specific to a certain field, or even a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, is it from a particular book, website, or conversation? Knowing the source could help determine its meaning and origin.


However, I can demonstrate the requested format using a similar-sounding word, "gossip":
