ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cathedrālis* (“of or belonging to a chair”), from Latin *cathedra* (“chair, seat”), from Ancient Greek *καθέδρα* (*kathédra*, “seat, chair”), from *κατά* (*katá*, “down”) + *ἕδρα* (*hédra*, “seat, base”).  The term originally referred to the bishop's throne, and by extension, to the church containing it.
