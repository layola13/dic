注意事项:

While "aborsement" technically can mean reimbursement, it is an archaic word and rarely used in modern English, especially in American English. "Reimbursement" is the preferred and more common term.  Its older meaning of miscarriage is also archaic.  Avoid using "aborsement" in contemporary writing or conversation, as it may cause confusion.  Use "reimbursement," "compensation," or a more specific term instead.
