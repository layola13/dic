Etymology: "oversolemnness" is derived from "over-" (prefix indicating excess) + "solemn" (from Old French "solempne," ultimately from Latin "solemnis," meaning "annual," "religious," "ceremonial," later developing the sense of "serious" and "grave") + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns denoting a state or quality).
