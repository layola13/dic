词源: From Middle English *harpen, from Old English hearpian (“to play on the harp”), from hearpe (“harp”), from Proto-Germanic *harpon (“harp”), from Proto-Indo-European *kerp- (“to pluck, to bend”).  The figurative sense of "to dwell tediously on a subject" arose from the idea of repeatedly plucking the same string of a harp.
