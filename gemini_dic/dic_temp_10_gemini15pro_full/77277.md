gastrula:/ˈɡæstrələ/| n. |原肠胚|An early multicellular embryo, composed of two or more germ layers, that forms by invagination of the blastula. It is the stage following the blastula and preceding the neurula in the development of most animals.|The gastrula stage is crucial for the development of the three germ layers.|近义词:embryo|反义词:None|名词
