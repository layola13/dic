fact's:/ˈfækts/| n.|事实;真相;实际情况|The fact's (fact is) that he was lying. 事实是他一直在撒谎。|近义词：reality, truth|反义词:fiction, lie|名词

词源:
From Latin *factum*, neuter of *factus*, past participle of *facere* "to do, make."

用法说明:

fact's 严格来说并非标准英语，是 fact is 的口语缩写。在正式写作中应避免使用。fact 本身是名词，fact's 作为所有格形式，理论上可以存在，例如 "The fact's significance is undeniable." (这个事实的重要性不可否认。) 但在实际应用中，fact's 多数情况下是 fact is 的口语误用或缩写。
