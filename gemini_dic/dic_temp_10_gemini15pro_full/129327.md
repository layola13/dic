ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *noise, noyse "noise, quarrel, disturbance," earlier "tumult, uproar, confusion of a multitude" (12c.), from Latin nausea "seasickness" (see nausea). The sense development in French seems to have been from "discomfort" to "disgust" to "quarrel" to "loud outcry," then in Middle English to "any loud sound."
