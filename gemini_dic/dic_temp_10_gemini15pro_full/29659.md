ETYMOLOGY->
The term "catfishing" gained popularity after the 2010 documentary film "Catfish."  The film's subject, Nev Schulman, was lured into an online relationship with a woman who turned out to be a completely different person.  The term is believed to be derived from an analogy made by Vince Pierce, Angela Wesselman's husband (the woman who "catfished" Nev).  He compared the practice to how catfish are put in tanks with cod to keep the cod active, thus ensuring the cod's meat remains firm.  Similarly, "catfish" keep people engaged in online communities.
