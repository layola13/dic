ETYMOLOGY->
From French *munition* (later *amunition*, with the *a-* perhaps from a confusion with Latin *admunitionem*, "fortification"), from Latin *munitionem*, accusative singular of *munitio*, "fortifying, defense, fortification," from *munire*, "to fortify, defend, protect."  The meaning shifted from "fortifications" to "military supplies" in general, and then specifically to "powder and shot."
