词源:
From "ivory tower" + "-ites" (suffix forming nouns denoting people associated with a particular place, belief, or practice).  "Ivory tower" itself is a translation of the French "tour d'ivoire," used by the poet and critic Sainte-Beuve in 1837 to describe the seclusion of the poet Alfred de Vigny. The image of an ivory tower suggests a place of beauty and isolation, detached from the harsh realities of the world.
