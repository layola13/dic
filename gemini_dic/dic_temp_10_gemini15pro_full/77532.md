词源:  "Gbop" is likely a slang term derived from "bebop," mimicking its rhythmic and improvisational nature.  It's not formally recognized in dictionaries, but used colloquially among musicians.  "Bebop" itself originated in the 1940s as a description of the complex, fast tempos and harmonies characteristic of this jazz style.  The exact origin of "bebop" is debated, but it is thought to be onomatopoeic, imitating the sounds of the music.
