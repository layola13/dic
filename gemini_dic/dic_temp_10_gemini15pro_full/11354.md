注意事项: "Aren't" is a contraction of "are not" and is primarily used in the present tense with plural subjects and second-person singular "you". It's important to use the correct negative contractions with different pronouns and tenses. "Aren't I" is an exception, used in questions, even though "am not" doesn't form a standard contraction.  Avoid using "aren't" with "I" in declarative sentences.  For other tenses and pronouns, use the appropriate negative contractions (e.g., isn't, wasn't, weren't, hasn't, haven't, hadn't, won't).
