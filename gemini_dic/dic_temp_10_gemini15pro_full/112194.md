词源：From *loony* (meaning "lunatic," influenced by *lunatic*) + *-est* (superlative suffix).  The word *loony* is a shortened, informal form of *lunatic*, which ultimately derives from the Latin word *lunaticus*, meaning "moonstruck."  This reflects the ancient belief that changes in the moon could cause insanity.
