PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases. It typically stands alone as an adverb.)


词源:  "noneuphoniously" comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") added to "euphoniously," which itself derives from "euphony" (meaning "pleasant sound").  "Euphony" has Greek roots: "eu-" (meaning "good" or "well") and "phone" (meaning "sound" or "voice").  Therefore, "noneuphoniously" literally means "not in a pleasant-sounding way."
