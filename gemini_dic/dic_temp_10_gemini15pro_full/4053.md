The word "aidian" is not a recognized English word. It is possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term specific to a certain field, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe it might mean, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For instance, perhaps you meant "idian" which can be related to "idea" or "ideal". Or, perhaps you meant "Aegean" which refers to the Aegean Sea.


However, I *can* demonstrate the format you requested using the word "idea":

idea: /aɪˈdiːə/
|n.|
|主意，想法，概念|
|A thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action.|
|例句：That's a great idea! 那真是个好主意！|

|例句：I have no idea what you're talking about. 我不知道你在说什么。|
|近义词：thought, concept, notion, plan|
|反义词：reality, actuality|
|词性：名词|
