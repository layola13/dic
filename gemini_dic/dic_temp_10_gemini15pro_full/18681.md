ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *bi-cweðan "to say, speak to, utter; declare, announce, proclaim; bequeath," from Proto-Germanic *bi-kwethanan (source also of Old Saxon bikwethan, Old Frisian bikwetha "to bequeath," Old High German biquethan "to say, bequeath," German ver-künden "to announce," Gothic biquethan "to command"), from *bi- "by, about" + *kwethanan "to say" (from PIE root *gwet- "to speak"). The original sense was "to give by speaking a formal declaration," specifically in a will.
