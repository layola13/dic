ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *personical*, from Old French *personical*, from Late Latin *personalis*, from Latin *persona* ("mask, character played by an actor, person"). The sense shifted from "relating to a person" to "relating to a parson" through the association of parsons with the performance of religious duties.
