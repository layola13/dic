enmew:  (This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.)

Since "enmew" isn't a recognized English word, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "**emmew**" (also archaic and rare),  it's possible to speculate, assuming it's related to "mew" (meaning to confine or enclose, like a cat mewing in a cage).
