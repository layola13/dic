Etymology:
non- (prefix) + influence (noun)

"non-"  is a Latin prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lack of."
"influence" comes from the Old French word "influence," which in turn derives from the Medieval Latin "influentia," meaning "inflow" or "flowing in."  It originally referred to the supposed flowing in of ethereal fluid from the stars that affected human destiny.
