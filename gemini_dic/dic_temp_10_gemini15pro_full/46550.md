From Canadian French *dalle* (plural *dalles*), from Old French *dale*, meaning "slab, gutter, drain." Ultimately from Frankish *dala* or similar, related to Old High German *tala* "valley."  The word acquired its North American meaning through its use to describe the flat, paved-like rock formations of the Columbia River.
