ETYMOLOGY->
From 'ear' (referring to the old wives' tale that earwigs crawl into people's ears) + 'wig' (from Old English 'wicga', meaning insect).  The original meaning referred to the insect, and the meaning of "eavesdropping" developed later, perhaps because the insect's pincers were thought to resemble tiny ear picks.
