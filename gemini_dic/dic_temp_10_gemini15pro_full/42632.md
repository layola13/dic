词源:
From counter- + scale (n.).  "Counter-" acts as a prefix meaning "opposite" or "against," while "scale" refers to a weighing device or a system of measurement.  Therefore, "counterscale" originally implied a balancing weight on the opposite side of a scale.  This meaning extended metaphorically to represent anything that acts as a balance or contrast to something else.
