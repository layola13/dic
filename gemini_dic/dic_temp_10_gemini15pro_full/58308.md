词源:
"dry" comes from Old English "dryge," related to Old High German "trucchen" and Old Norse "þurr."
"roast" comes from Old French "rostir," ultimately from Latin "torrere," meaning "to parch."  "Dry-roasted" is a combination of these two words, describing the process of roasting without added moisture or fat.
