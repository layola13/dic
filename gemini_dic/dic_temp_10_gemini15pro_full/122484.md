词源:  MOC likely originated as an abbreviation of "mock," a verb meaning "to imitate or mimic something, often in a playful or satirical way."  The noun form "mock" itself refers to an imitation or counterfeit. Over time, "moc" became a standalone term, particularly in educational and training contexts, to denote a practice test or exercise.
