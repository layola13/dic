PHRASE->
(Since "heam" is a specialized anatomical term, common phrases are unlikely.  Here are examples using the word in context):

ruptured heam  破裂的隔膜
heam inflammation 隔膜炎症
examining the heam 检查隔膜
repairing the heam 修复隔膜
heam tissue 隔膜组织


注意事项: "heam" is not a common word in standard English. It's possible there's a typo and you meant "heme" (related to blood) or another similar word.  This analysis is based on the assumption "heam" is intended to refer to a membrane.
