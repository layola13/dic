ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *fretan (attested only as past participle ge)freten, "devoured," from Proto-Germanic *fretaną ("to devour, consume, gnaw"), from Proto-Indo-European *gʷʰer- ("to rub, grind").  Cognate with Old Frisian freta, Old Saxon fretan, Old High German frezzan (German fressen, "to devour"), Old Norse freta ("to gnaw, corrode"), Gothic 𐍆𐍂𐌹𐍄𐌰𐌽 (fritan, "to devour").  The sense of "to worry" developed from the idea of "gnawing anxiety."
