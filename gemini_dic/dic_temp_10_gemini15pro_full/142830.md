out-boxing:/ˌaʊtˈbɒksɪŋ/ |n.| 外部装箱 |The process of converting a value type to an object type.  This involves wrapping the value type inside an object. In Java, this is often done implicitly through autoboxing, but the term out-boxing can be used to specifically refer to the act of converting from a primitive to its wrapper class.| Java uses autoboxing and out-boxing for converting primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes and vice-versa. For example, converting an int to Integer is autoboxing, and converting an Integer to int is out-boxing.| 近义词: unboxing, converting | 反义词: boxing, wrapping | 词性: noun

out-boxing:/ˌaʊtˈbɒksɪŋ/ |n.| 外部装箱 |The process of converting a value type to an object type. This involves creating a new object and placing the value of the value type inside it.  This is the opposite of boxing, where an object type is converted to a value type. |Explicit out-boxing is less common than autoboxing, but it's important to understand the concept.  Think of it as manually unwrapping a present.| 近义词: unboxing, unwrapping | 反义词: boxing, wrapping | 词性: noun
