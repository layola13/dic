There are no commonly used phrases with "overacutely".  This word is generally used on its own to modify a verb.

词源:

"Overacutely" comes from "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") + "acute" (meaning "sharp" or "sensitive") + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Acute" ultimately derives from the Latin word "acutus," the past participle of "acuere," meaning "to sharpen."
