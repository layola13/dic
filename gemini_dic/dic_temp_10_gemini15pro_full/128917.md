注意事项:
"ninan" itself is not a standard English word. It's derived from Spanish, and its usage is largely informal and affectionate.  It's more of a nickname or term of endearment than a dictionary-defined word.  Therefore, the provided analysis reflects its colloquial use, especially within Spanish-speaking communities or families.  The closest English equivalent would be "little girl," "lassie," or simply using the child's name.
