neurolinguistics:/ˌnʊroʊlɪŋˈɡwɪstɪks/ | n. |神经语言学|The study of the neural mechanisms in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. | Neurolinguistics helps us understand how the brain processes language. 神经语言学帮助我们理解大脑是如何处理语言的。|Synonyms: language science, psycholinguistics | Antonyms:  (No direct antonym exists.  Perhaps "non-linguistic neuroscience" could be considered a contrasting field.) | noun

neurolinguisticses:  This word is not standard English. "Neurolinguistics" is already plural in meaning and does not typically take an additional "-es" ending.  Use "neurolinguistics" instead.
