metalogical:/ˌmɛtəˈlɒdʒɪkəl/ | adj. | 元逻辑的 | Relating to the study of the formal properties of logical systems, such as their consistency, completeness, and soundness, rather than the content of those systems.  It deals with the properties of logical systems themselves, not the specific statements within those systems. |  Metalogical investigations often involve examining the relationship between different logical systems. 元逻辑研究通常涉及检验不同逻辑系统之间的关系。
The proof of the theorem's consistency relies on metalogical arguments. 该定理一致性证明依赖于元逻辑论证。 | 近义词: meta-logical | 反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps consider "object-language" as a contrasting term) | 词性: adjective
