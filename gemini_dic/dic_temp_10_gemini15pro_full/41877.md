coses is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling of "cases," "causes," or "closes."  I will analyze "cases" since it is the most probable intended word.


cases:/ˈkeɪsɪz/| n.|案例，情况，盒子|Instances of something; containers for holding things.|例句：There are many cases of COVID-19 this year. 今年有很多新冠肺炎病例。|例句：She packed her clothes in several cases. 她把衣服装在几个箱子里。|近义词：instances, examples, situations, boxes, containers|反义词: (No direct antonym, depends on context: e.g., cause vs. effect, open vs. close)|noun
