ETYMOLOGY->
From "out" + "sin."  "Out" meaning outside or excluded, and "sin" used archaically (and in some dialects) as a contraction of "since," meaning subsequently or afterward. This suggests the original meaning was someone who came into a situation later and thus was not part of the original group.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass anyone outside a particular group or lacking specialized knowledge.
