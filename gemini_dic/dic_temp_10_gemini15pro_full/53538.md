ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + avow + -ance.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of." "Avow" comes from Old French "avouer," meaning "to admit, confess, acknowledge."  "-ance" is a suffix forming nouns from verbs, indicating an action, state, or quality.  Therefore, "disavowance" literally means the act of not avowing or acknowledging.
