gyrator:/ˈdʒaɪreɪtər/| n.| 旋转器，回转器，陀螺仪|A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless two-port electrical network element proposed in 1948 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer. |The gyrator acts as a transducer between electrical energy in one form and magnetic energy in another.  回转器是电能和磁能之间的一种转换器。| synonym: converter, transducer | antonym: insulator | noun
