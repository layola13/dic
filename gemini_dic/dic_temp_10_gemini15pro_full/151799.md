USAGE->

USAGE->

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Vamos esquecer o passado. (We will forget the past.)  - Note: This uses "passado" but refers to a future action of forgetting the past.  This illustrates the point that "passado" is about the time frame being referred to, not the tense of the sentence itself.
N/A - While you can use "passado" in a future tense sentence, it's talking *about* the past, not happening *in* the future.  Constructing a natural example purely in the future tense is difficult.

He will talk about the past tomorrow.

PHRASE-> (These are difficult to provide as "passado" isn't English. These examples are Portuguese phrases, which again wouldn't be understood by an English speaker without translation.)

no passado = in the past
voltar ao passado = to return to the past
esquecer o passado = to forget the past
relembrar o passado = to remember the past
viver no passado = to live in the past


注意事项:

As noted repeatedly, "passado" is a Portuguese word.  Its inclusion here suggests the prompt was intended for a Portuguese language resource, not English.  While the structures above are grammatically correct Portuguese, they wouldn't be applicable in English.  A direct English equivalent would simply be "past" (adjective) or a phrase like "the past" (noun).
