gravitons: /ˈɡrævɪtɒnz/ (UK) /ˈɡrævɪtɑːnz/ (US)| n. | 引力子 | Hypothetical elementary particles that mediate the force of gravity. | Scientists are still searching for gravitons, which are theorized to be the force carriers for gravity. 科学家们仍在寻找引力子，理论上认为它们是引力的力载体。 |  Example 2: If gravitons exist, they would be massless and travel at the speed of light. 如果引力子存在，它们将是无质量的，并以光速传播。 | synonyms:  (no direct synonyms, as it's a hypothetical particle), force carrier | antonyms:  (not applicable) | noun
