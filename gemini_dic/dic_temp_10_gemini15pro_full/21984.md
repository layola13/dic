bohr: /bɔːr/ | n. | 玻尔 |  Refers to Niels Bohr (1885-1962), a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory. The Bohr model depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons.  | Niels Bohr won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. 尼尔斯·玻尔于1922年获得诺贝尔物理学奖。 | synonym:  (In the context of the model) Rutherford-Bohr model | antonym: N/A | noun

bohr: /bɔːr/ | n. | 玻尔 | The name "Bohr" is also used in the context of the Bohr radius, Bohr magneton, and other concepts related to his work. | The Bohr radius is a physical constant that defines the most probable distance between the electron and the nucleus in a hydrogen atom. 玻尔半径是一个物理常数，它定义了氢原子中电子与原子核之间最可能的距离。 | synonym: N/A | antonym: N/A | noun
