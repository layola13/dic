ETYMOLOGY->
From Hindi/Urdu dāmān دامن  meaning "skirt, edge, border," from Persian dāmān دامن with the same meaning.  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁- "to put, place."  The meaning shifted to "dam" in English likely through association with the idea of a barrier forming a "skirt" or "edge" holding back water.
