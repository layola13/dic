词源: From "forgive" (from Old English forgiefan, "to give, grant, bestow; remit (a debt or punishment)") + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition).  The plural form "-nesses" is less common than the singular "forgiveness," but valid when referring to multiple instances of forgiveness.
