Etymology:
From Middle English *lewedest, superlative of *lewed (“lay, unlearned, ignorant; vulgar, base, vile; wanton, lascivious”), from Old English lǣwede (“lay, not of the clergy; unlearned, ignorant; of the laity”), from Proto-Germanic *laiwaz (“layman”), from Proto-Indo-European *lēy- (“to leave”).  The sense development is from "unlearned, ignorant" to "vulgar, base, vile" to "sexually unrestrained."
