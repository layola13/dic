词源:  From Old English fæðm "embrace, grasp, length of the outstretched arms," from Proto-Germanic *fathmaz (source also of Old Norse faðmr, Old Frisian fethm, Dutch vadem, German Faden "thread, fathom"), from PIE root *pet- "to spread, stretch."  Originally a nautical measure of six feet, the length of two outstretched arms. The figurative sense of "penetrate and understand" is from the mid-17th century.
