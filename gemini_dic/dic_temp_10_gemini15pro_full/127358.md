/ˈɛn siː ɑːr ɛs/ | abbreviation | n. |  无组合重复数 | nCr, the number of combinations of n things taken r at a time, often written as "n choose r" and calculated as n! / (r! * (n-r)!).  | Example: The number of ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 is 5C3 (or ⁵C₃ or $\binom{5}{3}$) which equals 10.  五个人中选出三人组成委员会的方式有 5C3 (或 ⁵C₃ 或 $\binom{5}{3}$) 种，结果等于 10。 | Synonym: combinations | Antonym: permutations | abbreviation

/ˈɛn siː ɑːr ɛs/ | initialism | n. |  无组合重复数 | nCr, representing "n choose r," a mathematical function used to calculate the number of combinations of selecting r items from a set of n items without regard to order and without replacement.  | Example:  If you have 5 different colored balls and want to choose 3 of them, the number of combinations is 5C3 = 10. 如果你有5个不同颜色的球，想从中选择3个，组合数是5C3 = 10。 | Synonym: combinations | Antonym: permutations | initialism
