ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *frēosan "to freeze," from Proto-Germanic *freusaną, from Proto-Indo-European *preus- "to freeze."  The sense of "to release, set free" developed later, likely metaphorically from the idea of releasing something from a frozen or fixed state. The noun form developed from the verb.
