词源:  "Mane" refers to the long hair growing from the top of a horse's neck.  "Sheet" refers to a piece of paper. Therefore, a "manesheet" is a sheet (of paper) with information about horses' manes (and other characteristics).  While the connection to "mane" is less direct now, it originally implied a record focused on identifying horses, perhaps including descriptions of their manes.  Over time, it broadened to include any list or register of horses.
