词源:
From *blackguard* + *-ism*.  *Blackguard* originally referred to the lowest menials in a royal or noble household, often associated with kitchens and sculleries, and thus with dirtiness and low morals.  Over time, the term evolved to mean a scoundrel or villain. The suffix *-ism* denotes a characteristic practice, doctrine, or behavior.  Therefore, *blackguardisms* signifies the actions or language typical of a blackguard.
