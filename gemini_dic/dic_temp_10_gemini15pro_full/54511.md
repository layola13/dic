ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + joint + -ed + -ness.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "apart," "asunder," or indicating reversal. "Joint" refers to a point of connection.  "-ed" is a suffix forming the past participle of verbs, but here it creates an adjective meaning "having the quality of being disjointed." "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
