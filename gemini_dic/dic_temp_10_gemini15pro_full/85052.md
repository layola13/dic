注意事项:
Since "hard's" is primarily a casual or dialectal term, it's generally not recommended for formal writing.  It's crucial to understand that "hards" (hardships) is the standard and preferred form.  While the examples above demonstrate usage in different tenses, using "hardships" would be grammatically correct and more appropriate in most contexts.
