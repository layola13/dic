lipayer: /liːˈpeɪər/ (This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.)


Since "lipayer" isn't a recognized English word, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if we assume it's intended to be related to "payer" (one who pays), I can offer an analysis based on that:

payer: /ˈpeɪər/
n.|付款人；支付者|Someone who pays a sum of money.| The payer of the invoice is responsible for ensuring the funds are available. 发票的付款人有责任确保资金到位。|  The company is a major payer of local taxes.  这家公司是地方税收的主要缴纳者。 | debtor, purchaser | creditor |noun
