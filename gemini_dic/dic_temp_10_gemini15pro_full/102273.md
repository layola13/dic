PHRASE->
N/A (since "-itive" is a suffix, it does not have phrases associated with it directly.  Phrases would be formed with words ending in "-itive")


注意事项:
Since "-itive" is a suffix, it does't have antonyms or synonyms. It's used to form adjectives, and the resulting adjectives will have their own antonyms and synonyms.  For example, the antonym of "sensitive" might be "insensitive" or "uncaring," and a synonym might be "responsive" or "perceptive."  Similarly, "competitive" might have "cooperative" as an antonym and "ambitious" or "driven" as synonyms.
