词源: From fiend + -ed.  "Fiend" itself comes from Old English *fēond (meaning "enemy, devil"), related to Old Frisian fiand, Old Saxon fiond, Old High German fiant, Old Norse fjándi, Gothic fijands (all meaning "enemy"). The original sense was simply "enemy," but it gradually came to be associated primarily with the Devil and evil spirits.
