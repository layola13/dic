词源:  "flattening" comes from "flatten," which originated from the Old Norse word "flatna" meaning "to become flat."  "-ing" is a suffix forming present participles and gerunds.  "out" is an adverb indicating completeness or thoroughness. Thus, "flattening-out" describes the process of becoming completely flat or level.
