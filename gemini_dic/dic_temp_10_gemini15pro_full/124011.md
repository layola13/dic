"morom" is not a recognized English word.  It might be a misspelling, slang, a regionalism, or a word from another language.  Therefore, standard dictionary information cannot be provided.  If you can provide more context, such as the language it comes from or where you encountered it, I may be able to provide more information.

Since I cannot analyze "morom," I will demonstrate the requested format using the word "axiom."

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；格言；自明之理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example 1:  It is a widely held axiom that good health is more valuable than money. 健康比金钱更宝贵，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。 | Example 2:  One of the basic axioms of geometry is that two points determine a line. 几何学的一个基本公理是两点确定一条直线。 | Synonym:  principle, maxim, truism | Antonym:  paradox, fallacy | noun
