Etymology:
From inviting + -ness + -'s (possessive).  Inviting comes from the verb invite, which traces back to Old French inviter and ultimately to Latin invitare "to entertain, invite," from in- "in" + votare "to vow, promise, dedicate." The suffix -ness forms nouns indicating a state or quality. The -'s is the possessive marker, indicating ownership or belonging.
