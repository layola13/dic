nondependencies:/ˌnɒndɪˈpɛndənsiz/ | n. | 非依赖性，独立性 | Absence of dependencies; things that are not dependent on something else.  This word isn't standard English and is likely a misspelling or a neologism.  It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "dependencies." |  Due to the project's modular design, the nondependencies between components allowed for easier updates. (This is an example assuming the word exists and is used in this context. In standard English, one might say "independence" or "lack of dependencies.") | Near Synonyms: independence, autonomy, self-sufficiency | Antonyms: dependence, reliance | noun

They will have been working on achieving greater nondependencies for several years by the time the project is complete. = 到项目完成时，他们将已经致力于实现更大的非依赖性好几年了。


PHRASE-> (Since "nondependencies" is not a standard English word, common phrases are difficult to provide.  These examples are purely hypothetical and based on the presumed meaning of the word.)
achieve nondependencies =  实现非依赖性
ensure nondependencies = 确保非依赖性
promote nondependencies = 促进非依赖性
maintain nondependencies = 维持非依赖性
lack of nondependencies = 缺乏非依赖性


注意事项:  It is highly recommended to use standard English vocabulary like "independence," "autonomy," or "lack of dependencies" instead of "nondependencies."  This word is not commonly recognized and may cause confusion.
