词源：
The surname Palgrave is of Anglo-Saxon origin, meaning "palace grove" or "palace wood."  It's a locational surname, indicating someone who lived near such a place.  While the publishing house Palgrave Macmillan takes its name from the founder, Francis Turner Palgrave, the connection to the original meaning of the word is purely coincidental in this context.
