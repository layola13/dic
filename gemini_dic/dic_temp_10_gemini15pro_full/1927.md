actinology: /ˌæktɪˈnɒlədʒi/
noun
放射线学; 光化學
The study of the effects of radiation, especially sunlight, on living organisms.  It also encompasses the study of the chemical effects of light and other radiant energy.
Actinology plays a crucial role in understanding skin cancer. 放射线学在理解皮肤癌方面起着至关重要的作用。

Actinology is important for developing new treatments for certain skin conditions. 光化學对于开发某些皮肤病的新疗法很重要。

近义词: radiology, photobiology
反义词:  (No direct antonym, but one could consider areas of study that don't involve radiation or light, perhaps something like "molecular biology" in certain contexts, though this isn't a true opposite.)
词性: noun
