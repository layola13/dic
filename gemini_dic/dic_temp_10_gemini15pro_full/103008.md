USAGE->

USAGE->
一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Jeg spiser. (I eat.)
Jeg læser en bog. (I read a book.)

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Jeg spiser lige nu. (I am eating right now.)
Jeg læser en bog i øjeblikket.  (I am reading a book at the moment.)

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):  Not applicable in Danish in the same way as English. Danish uses the present perfect to describe past events with present relevance, similar to the English preterite.
Jeg har spist. (I have eaten / I ate).
Jeg har læst bogen. (I have read the book / I read the book).


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous): Not directly translatable.  Danish would likely use present perfect or past tense.
Jeg har læst i bogen i en time. (I have been reading the book for an hour / I was reading the book for an hour.)
Jeg har spist hele dagen. (I have been eating all day / I was eating all day).

一般过去时 (Simple Past): Not a separate tense in Danish, usually covered by the present perfect.
Jeg spiste. (I ate.)
Jeg læste en bog. (I read a book.)

Jeg var ved at spise. (I was eating. - literally "I was at eating")
Jeg sad og læste. (I was reading - Literally, "I sat and read")

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Jeg vil spise. (I will eat.)
Jeg skal læse en bog. (I will read a book - using "skal" implies a stronger intention.)

Jeg vil sidde og læse. (I will be reading.)

注意事项:

Danish grammar significantly differs from English.  These examples illustrate how the intended meaning would be conveyed in Danish, even if a direct grammatical equivalent doesn't exist.  The use of "present perfect" to often describe simple past events is a key difference to note.
