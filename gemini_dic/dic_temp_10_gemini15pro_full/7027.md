PHRASE->
(While "ands" itself isn't commonly used in set phrases, the following are examples using "and")

fish and chips 炸鱼薯条
rock and roll 摇滚乐
bread and butter 奶油面包
black and white 黑白
peace and quiet 安静祥和

注意事项:

"Ands" is archaic and not considered standard modern English. It is rarely used and "and" should be used instead.  It is included here for completeness, as the request specifically asked for its analysis. Using "ands" in modern writing would likely be seen as an error.
