amylogenic: /ˌæmɪloʊˈdʒɛnɪk/
adjective
产淀粉的；淀粉生成的
Producing or forming starch.
Amylogenic enzymes are responsible for the synthesis of starch. 产淀粉酶负责淀粉的合成。
Certain bacteria are amylogenic.  某些细菌能产生淀粉。
近义词: starch-forming, starch-producing
反义词: amylolytic (淀粉分解的)
词性: adjective

词源:  From amyl- + -genic.  "Amyl-" comes from the Greek word "amylon" meaning "starch," and "-genic" means "producing" or "forming."
