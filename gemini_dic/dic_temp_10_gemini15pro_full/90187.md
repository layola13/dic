From "hot" (meaning heated, passionate) + "spur" (a device used to urge a horse forward).  The combined meaning suggests someone driven by passion and quick to act.  The word gained popularity after Shakespeare's play "Henry IV, Part 1," featuring the character Harry Hotspur, known for his fiery temper and impulsiveness.
