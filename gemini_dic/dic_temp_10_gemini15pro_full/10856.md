词源:  "Arability" comes from the Latin word "arabilis," meaning "capable of being plowed," derived from "arare," meaning "to plow."  This reflects the word's original connection to agriculture and land suitable for cultivation.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass the general availability or usability of resources or capabilities.
