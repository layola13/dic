ETYMOLOGY->
Origin uncertain. Possibly from a dialectal word meaning 'short and thick,' or perhaps related to 'bunt,' meaning to 'push' or 'butt.'  The association with prison clothes likely arose from their baggy, ill-fitting nature, and the Australian usage for 'escaped convict' probably stems from their wearing such clothes.
