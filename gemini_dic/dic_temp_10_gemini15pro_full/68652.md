farad:/ˈfæræd/ | n. | 法拉 | The standard unit of capacitance, equal to the capacitance of a capacitor in which one coulomb of charge causes a potential difference of one volt.  A farad is a very large unit, and most capacitors used in electronic circuits have capacitances measured in microfarads (µF) or picofarads (pF). | The capacitor has a capacitance of 100 microfarads.  这个电容器的电容是100微法。| Synonyms: capacitance unit | Antonyms: N/A | Noun
