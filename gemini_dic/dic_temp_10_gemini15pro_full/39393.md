词源:
From Late Latin *conjūrāre, from Latin conjūrō (“I conspire, swear together, conjure”), from con- (“together”) + jūrō (“I swear”).  The sense development is from "conspire" to "invoke (a demon or spirit) by an oath" to the modern meanings.
来自晚期拉丁语 *conjūrāre，源自拉丁语 conjūrō（“我密谋，一起发誓，召唤”），来自 con-（“一起”）+ jūrō（“我发誓”）。  意义发展是从“密谋”到“通过誓言召唤（恶魔或灵魂）”再到现代意义。
