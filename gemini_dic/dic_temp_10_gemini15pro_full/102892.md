词源:
"Jaw-breaking" is a compound word formed from "jaw" and "breaking."  "Jaw" refers to the lower jawbone used for chewing, while "breaking" implies the difficulty or effort involved in the action.  Thus, the word literally suggests something so hard it could break one's jaw.  Figuratively, it extends to words that are difficult to pronounce, as the effort involved is analogous to breaking one's jaw.
