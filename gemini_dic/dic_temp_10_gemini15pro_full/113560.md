ETYMOLOGY->
From Italian *macaronico* "macaronic," from *maccarone* "dumpling, simpleton," perhaps from Late Latin *macaronea*, plural of *macaroneus* "a kind of dumpling."  The sense development is likely from the idea of a crudely mixed dish, like a dumpling made of various ingredients. Ultimately from Greek *makaria* "blessedness, food of the gods." The connection between the food and the linguistic sense is likely that macaronic verse was perceived as a crude or "vulgar" mixture.
