ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + practicable + -ness.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not."  "Practicable" comes from the Late Middle English "practicable," from Old French "praticable," from Medieval Latin "practicabilis,"  meaning "capable of being put into practice," from Latin "practicare," to practice, frequentative of "practic," skilled, from Greek "praktikos." "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns from adjectives, meaning "state or quality of being."
