词源:
From Late Latin *discommodiosus, from Latin dis- 'not' + commodus 'convenient'.  The root "commodus" comes from "com-" (together) and "modus" (measure, manner), suggesting something fitting together well.  Thus, "discommodious" literally means "not fitting together well," leading to the sense of inconvenience and lack of comfort.
