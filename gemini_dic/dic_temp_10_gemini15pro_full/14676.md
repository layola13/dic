注意事项:  "Awe" as a verb is less common than "awe" as a noun and the interjection "aw".  The most common usage involving the verb "awe" is in the passive voice, e.g., "I was awed by the performance."  The continuous tenses with the verb "awe" often sound unnatural. Using "to be in awe of" is usually a more natural way to express these sentiments.
