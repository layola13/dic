Despiteously is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It likely represents a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, providing a standard linguistic analysis is not possible.

However, if we assume it's intended to convey a meaning similar to "despitefully" or "contemptuously," we can offer a hypothetical analysis:


/dɪˈspaɪtfəli/ (hypothetical pronunciation based on similar words)
Adverb (hypothetical)
轻蔑地，恶意地，故意地
In a manner showing contempt or malice; deliberately.

Example:  He despiteously ignored her pleas for help.  他恶意地无视了她寻求帮助的请求。


Example: She despiteously threw the gift back in his face. 她轻蔑地把礼物扔回他脸上。

Synonym: contemptuously, disdainfully, scornfully, spitefully
Antonym: respectfully, politely, kindly

Word Origin (hypothetical):  Could be derived from "despite" (meaning "in spite of") + "-ously" (adverbial suffix).
