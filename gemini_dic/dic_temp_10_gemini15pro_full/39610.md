PHRASE->
(While "consensus's" is grammatically correct, it's rarely used and sounds awkward.  It's better to rephrase using "of the consensus".)  虽然 "consensus's" 在语法上是正确的，但它很少被使用，而且听起来很别扭。最好用 "of the consensus" 来改写。


Therefore, providing phrases using "consensus's" is not practical.  因此，提供使用 "consensus's" 的短语是不切实际的.  It's recommended to avoid using "consensus's" whenever possible.  建议尽可能避免使用 "consensus's"。
