algorism: /ˈælɡəˌrɪzəm/ | n. | 算法，算术 | An older word for algorithm, referring to the process of performing arithmetic calculations using Arabic numerals.  | Example: The algorism for long division was taught in elementary school.  小学教授了长除法的计算方法。 | Example:  Ancient mathematicians developed complex algorisms for astronomical calculations. 古代数学家为天文计算开发了复杂的算法。 | 近义词: algorithm, arithmetic, calculation | 反义词:  None | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Medieval Latin *algorismus, derived from the name of the Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (c. 780 – c. 850).  The term originally referred to the system of Arabic numerals and the methods of calculation using them.
