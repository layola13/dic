词源:  From Middle English *lene, from Old English hlæne (“lean, meager, thin, slender, poor, mean, despicable, vile”), from Proto-Germanic *hlainaz (“lean”). Cognate with Dutch leen (“loan”), German lehen (“fief”), Gothic (leihns, “loan”). More at loan.  The sense development in English is possibly influenced by Old French clin (“lean, thin”), from Latin clīnus (“sloping, inclined”).
