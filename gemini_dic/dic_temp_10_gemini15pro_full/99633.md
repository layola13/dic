ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *interlasinge*, derived from the verb *interlace*, from inter- + lace (“to fasten with a lace or cord”).  The "inter-" prefix signifies "between" or "among," and "lace" refers to the act of fastening or joining with a cord or string.  Thus, "interlace" literally means "to lace between or among."
