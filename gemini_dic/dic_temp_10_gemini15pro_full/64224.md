equimultiple:/ˌiːkwɪˈmʌltɪpl/ | adj. | 等倍数的，同倍数的 | Having the same multiples.  Two quantities are equimultiple if one is a multiple of the other and vice versa, or if both are multiples of some common quantity. | If a and b are equimultiple of m and n, then a = km and b = kn for some integer k.  如果a和b是m和n的等倍数，那么对于某个整数k，a = km且b = kn。| synonym: commensurable | antonym: incommensurable | adjective

equimultiple:/ˌiːkwɪˈmʌltɪpl/ | n. | 等倍数 | A number or quantity that is a multiple of two or more given numbers or quantities by the same factor. | 12 and 18 are equimultiples of 3 and 4, respectively, since 12 = 4 * 3 and 18 = 4 * 4.5, but they are also equimultiples of 2 and 3 as 12=6*2 and 18=6*3. 12和18分别是3和4的等倍数，因为12 = 4 * 3和18 = 4 * 4.5，但它们也是2和3的等倍数，因为12=6*2和18=6*3。 | synonym: common multiple | antonym:  (no direct antonym, perhaps non-common multiple) | noun
