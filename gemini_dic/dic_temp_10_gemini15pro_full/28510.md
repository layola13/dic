词源: "Carder" (related to credit card fraud) derives from the act of "carding," which initially referred to using a carding machine to prepare fibers for spinning.  This term was later adopted in the context of credit card fraud, likely due to the process of testing stolen credit card numbers resembling the repetitive action of a carding machine.  "Carder" (related to wool) comes from the verb "to card," which means to comb or disentangle fibers using a card, a tool with metal teeth. This ultimately derives from the Latin "carduus," meaning "thistle," due to the thistle's prickly nature resembling the teeth of a carding tool.
