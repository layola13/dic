词源:  From "intend" + "-ed" + "-ness" + "-es" (plural).  "Intend" comes from Old French "entendre" meaning "to turn one's attention to," ultimately from Latin "intendere," meaning "to stretch out, extend." "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a state or quality. "-ed" and "-es" are suffixes related to past participle and plural forms, respectively.
