ETYMOLOGY->
"fly-" in this context likely comes from the older sense of "to travel over (a distance) in an aircraft or spacecraft" which was then extended to any kind of quick or long-distance travel. "Driver" comes from the verb "to drive" which originates from Old English *drīfan "to push, compel, force into motion." Thus, "fly-driver" emphasizes the aspect of travelling a distance, driving oneself.
