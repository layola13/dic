词源:  The origin is uncertain.  One theory suggests it comes from a conjuring term, perhaps related to the sleight of hand used in magic tricks. Another suggests it's related to the 19th-century children's game "Hanky, Panky, Shanghai," where children hide an object.  The sexual connotation likely developed later.
