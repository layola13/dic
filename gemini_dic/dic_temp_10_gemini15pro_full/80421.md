PHRASE->
N/A (This word is rarely used in phrases. It's a technical term primarily used in geometry.)


注意事项:
The word "gon" is more commonly used in its slang meaning in everyday conversation. In a formal or technical context, "angle" or "corner" are generally preferred.  For example, "pentagon" (five-sided figure) is more common than "five-gon."
