注意事项:

Old English grammar is significantly different from Modern English.  Tenses and aspects don't map directly.  The examples provided attempt to illustrate the closest functional equivalents, but true Old English usage is often more nuanced.  The pronunciation given is a modern approximation, as the precise pronunciation of Old English is debated.  The word "lebban" is primarily found in West Saxon dialects of Old English.
