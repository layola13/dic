Etymology:
From Japanese 印籠 (inrō), from 印 (in, “seal, stamp”) + 籠 (rō, “basket, cage”). Originally a small, tiered container worn on the sash of a kimono, often beautifully decorated, used to carry small objects like seals and medicines.  The segmented nature of the inro perhaps suggested the idea of a piece leading into something larger.
