ETYMOLOGY->
The etymology of "kike" is uncertain, but one popular theory suggests it derives from the practice of Jewish immigrants signing with a circle (rather than an "X") on immigration documents at Ellis Island.  The Yiddish word for "circle" is קיכל (kichel), and some believe "kike" may have evolved from this.  Another theory posits a link to the German word "Kieke," meaning "peephole," suggesting a derogatory reference to stereotypical Jewish features. Regardless of its precise origin, the term is unequivocally offensive and rooted in anti-Semitism.
