词源:  The word "furphy" originated in Australia during World War I. It referred to a large, cylindrical water cart, manufactured by the Furphy family, which was used by soldiers.  These carts became a gathering place where soldiers would exchange rumours and stories, hence the association of the name "Furphy" with rumour or untrue stories.
