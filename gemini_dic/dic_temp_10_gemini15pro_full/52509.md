ETYMOLOGY->
From the adjective "differential" + "-ly."  "Differential" comes from the Late Latin "differentiālis," from "differentiāre" meaning "to distinguish," derived from "differēns" (present participle of "differre"), meaning "to differ."  Ultimately from Latin "dis-" ("apart, asunder") + "ferre" ("to carry, bear").
