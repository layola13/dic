ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *antelop, from Medieval Latin antalopus, probably from Byzantine Greek ἀνθόλοψ (anthólops), perhaps meaning "flower-eyed" or "bright-eyed," from ἄνθος (ánthos, “flower, bloom”) + ὤψ (ṓps, “eye, face”). The actual Byzantine Greek word for antelope was δορκάς (dorkás). The word was first used in English in the early 17th century.
