Etymology:

over- + secretion

"over-"  Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi (source also of Old Saxon obar, Old Frisian over, Old Norse yfir, Dutch over, German über, Gothic ufar "over, above, beyond"), from PIE *uper "over, above, beyond" (source also of Sanskrit upari "over, above, on, upon," Avestan upairi "above, over, upon," Greek hyper "over, above," Latin super "above, over, on top of," Old Irish for "on, over").

"secretion"  late 14c., "action of separating," from Old French secretion (14c.) or directly from Latin secretionem (nominative secretio) "separation, a dividing off, severing," noun of action from past-participle stem of secernere "to separate, divide, distinguish, set apart, sift," from se- "apart" (see se-) + cernere "to distinguish, separate, sift" (from PIE root *krei- "to sieve," thus "to discriminate, distinguish"). Meaning "something secreted" is from 1610s.
