molybdenums:/məˈlɪbdənəmz/
noun|钼（元素），钼制品|A silvery-white, hard metallic element used in strengthening steel and other alloys.|Molybdenums are essential for the production of high-strength steel. 钼对于生产高强度钢至关重要。|Synonyms: Mo, molybdenum (singular form)|Antonyms: None (as it is a specific element)|n.

ETYMOLOGY->
From Modern Latin *molybdaenum*, from Ancient Greek *μόλυβδος* (mólybdos, “lead”), because molybdenite (the principal ore of molybdenum) resembles lead ore (galena). The suffix "-ums" is an irregular pluralization, the standard form being "molybdenum" even when referring to multiple discrete pieces or types of molybdenum.
