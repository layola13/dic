ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *abruken*, from Old English *ābrūcan* (“to use up, consume, enjoy, brook, suffer”), from *ā-* (an intensifying prefix) + *brūcan* (“to use, enjoy, brook”).  Ultimately from Proto-Germanic *brukōną* (“to use, enjoy”). Related to Dutch *gebruiken* (“to use”), German *brauchen* (“to need”). The sense shifted from "to use up" to "to put up with" over time.
