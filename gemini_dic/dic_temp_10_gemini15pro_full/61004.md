注意事项:

"Eliminately" is not a common word in modern English. While grammatically correct, it sounds archaic and might be better replaced with synonyms like "completely," "thoroughly," or "entirely."  It was more common in the 19th century.  Using it in contemporary writing might make the text sound stilted.
