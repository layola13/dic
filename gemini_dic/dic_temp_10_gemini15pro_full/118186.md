注意事项:

*mentis* itself is not commonly used in English outside of specific Latin phrases or medical contexts. It's more typical to use words like "mind," "intellect," "psyche," or other synonyms.  The word is the genitive (possessive) form of the Latin word "mens" meaning "mind."  Therefore, it translates to "of the mind".
