hydrostat:/ˈhaɪdrəstæt/| n.|流体静力仪，静压表|An instrument for determining the specific gravity of liquids, and thence the strength of spirituous liquors, saline solutions, etc., or for ascertaining the level of a liquid in a closed vessel.|The hydrostat showed a significant pressure drop.|近义词:manometer, pressure gauge|反义词: (No direct antonym exists for a physical instrument.  Perhaps conceptually: barometer - which measures atmospheric pressure rather than contained fluid pressure)|noun
