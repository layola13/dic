From "dummy" + "-est" (superlative suffix).  "Dummy" originated in the late 16th century, likely a shortened form of "dumb" influenced by words like "mummy."  Originally referring to a mute person, its meaning broadened to include a stupid or unintelligent person, and later, a mannequin or inanimate object.
