magnetisms:/ˈmæɡnɪˌtɪzəmz/
|n.|磁性，吸引力；磁学|The magnetism of the Earth protects us from harmful radiation. 地球的磁性保护我们免受有害辐射。| Magnetism is the force exerted by magnets when they attract or repel each other. 磁性是磁铁相互吸引或排斥时施加的力。| 近义词：attraction, appeal, charisma, pull, allure|反义词：repulsion|词性:名词


Etymology:
From Late Latin *magnetismus, from Latin magnes (“magnet, lodestone”) (ultimately from Ancient Greek μαγνῆτις λίθος (magnētis líthos, “Magnesian stone”)), + -ismus.  The English word magnetism was first attested in the mid-17th century.
