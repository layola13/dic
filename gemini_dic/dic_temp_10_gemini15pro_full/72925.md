Etymology:
From fond + -ish.  "Fond" traces back to the Middle English "fonnen," meaning "to be foolish or act foolishly," which in turn comes from the Old English "fann," meaning "foolish." Over time, the meaning shifted from "foolishly affectionate" to simply "affectionate."  The suffix "-ish" diminishes the intensity of the adjective, making it mean "somewhat fond."
