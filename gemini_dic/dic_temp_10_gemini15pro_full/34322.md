The word "clarsechs" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a misspelling or a word from a specialized field or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "clarsex", which might be short for "clarinet sextet", then a possible analysis could be constructed based on its component parts:

**clarinet:** /ˌklærəˈnɛt/ | n. | 单簧管 | A single-reed woodwind instrument with a cylindrical bore and a flared bell. | Example: He plays the clarinet in the school band. 他在学校乐队吹单簧管。 | Synonym: reed instrument | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Noun

**sextet:** /sɛkˈstɛt/ | n. | 六重奏; 六重唱 | A group of six musicians or singers; a piece of music for such a group. | Example: The string sextet performed beautifully.  弦乐六重奏表演得很精彩。 | Synonym: ensemble, group | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Noun

**clarsex (hypothetical):** /ˈklɑːrˌsɛks/ | n. | 单簧管六重奏 | A group of six clarinet players or a piece of music for six clarinets. | Example: The clarsex premiered their new piece last night. 单簧管六重奏昨晚首演了他们的新作品. | Synonym: clarinet ensemble | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Noun
