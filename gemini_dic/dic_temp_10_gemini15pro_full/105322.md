**词源:**

The origin of "kibosh" is uncertain. One popular theory suggests it comes from the Irish word "cie bais" (pronounced "ky-bosh"), meaning "cap of death," referring to a judge's black cap worn when pronouncing a death sentence.  Another theory links it to the Yiddish word "kaybesh," meaning "to suppress."
