"Detteles" is not a recognized word in standard English, French, or other common European languages. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you intended a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to analyze it for you.

If "detteles" is a neologism or a word from a specialized field, please provide context, and I can offer some speculative analysis based on its possible origins and intended meaning.


However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage with the word "what," I can provide that information below, following the requested format.  I'll use "what" as the word to be analyzed, since "detteles" isn't a valid word.

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv. | 什么 | Used to ask for information about something.  | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonyms: which, how, why (depending on context) | Antonyms:  N/A (Interrogative words don't typically have antonyms) | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
