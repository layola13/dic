lorentz:/ˈlɔːrents/ | adj. n. | 洛伦兹的; 洛伦兹 | Relating to Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, a Dutch physicist, or his work, especially in electromagnetism and the theory of relativity.  | Lorentz transformations are a key part of special relativity. 洛伦兹变换是狭义相对论的关键部分。|  The Lorentz force describes the force exerted on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. 洛伦兹力描述了磁场中运动的带电粒子所受的力。 | synonymous: relativistic (in some contexts) | antonymous: (No direct antonym. Could consider "classical" in contrasting classical physics with relativistic physics, but only in specific contexts) | adjective, noun
