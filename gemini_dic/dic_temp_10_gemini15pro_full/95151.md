inaquation:/ɪnɪˈkweɪʃən/
noun
不等式
An inequation is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are not equal.
例句：The inequation x + 2 > 5 means that x must be greater than 3.  不等式 x + 2 > 5 表示 x 必须大于 3。

例句：Solving the inequation 2y < 10 gives us y < 5.  解不等式 2y < 10，得到 y < 5。
近义词:inequality
反义词:equation
