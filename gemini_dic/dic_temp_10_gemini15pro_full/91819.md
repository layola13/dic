hyperfunctions:/ˌhaɪpərˈfʌŋkʃənz/| n. |超函数|A mathematical concept generalizing the notion of functions, often used in the theory of partial differential equations and other areas of analysis.  They can be thought of as "generalized functions" that extend the concept of ordinary functions to include objects like the Dirac delta function.|The theory of hyperfunctions provides a rigorous framework for working with objects like the Dirac delta function.|近义词:generalized functions, distributions|反义词: (No direct antonym.  Perhaps "ordinary functions" or "classical functions" in a specific context)|noun
