词源:
The origin is uncertain, but it likely comes from the image of a rooster (cock) perched high up (a-hoop), crowing triumphantly.  One theory suggests "hoop" refers to a barrel, and a cock standing on a barrel would be in a prominent, boastful position.  Another theory links it to the hoisting of a barrel of ale to celebrate a victory.
