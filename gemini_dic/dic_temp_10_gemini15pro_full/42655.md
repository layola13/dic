ETYMOLOGY->
counter- (prefix) + statement
"counter-" comes from the Old French "contre-" meaning "against" which ultimately derives from the Latin "contra" meaning "against, opposite".
"statement" comes from the Old French "estat" meaning "state, condition" ultimately from the Latin "status" meaning "manner of standing, condition".  The suffix "-ment" creates a noun from a verb.  Thus, a "statement" is something that is stated.
