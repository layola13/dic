electroscope:/ɪˈlɛktrəˌskoʊp/| n. |验电器|An instrument used to detect the presence and magnitude of electric charge. It typically consists of a metal rod with two thin leaves of gold or aluminum foil attached to its bottom end. When a charged object is brought near the electroscope, the leaves repel each other, indicating the presence of a charge.|The scientist used an electroscope to demonstrate the principles of static electricity.|Synonyms: charge detector, electrometer|Antonyms: N/A|noun
