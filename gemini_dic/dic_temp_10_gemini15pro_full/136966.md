nonspectrality:/ˌnɒnspekˈtrælɪti/ (US) /ˌnɒnspekˈtrælɪti/ (UK)| n.|非谱性，非光谱性|The nonspectrality of the phenomenon makes it difficult to analyze using traditional spectroscopic methods.  这种现象的非谱性使得难以使用传统的光谱方法进行分析。|This research explores the nonspectrality of certain quantum phenomena. 这项研究探讨了某些量子现象的非谱性。|近义词: non-spectral nature, a spectral absence|反义词: spectrality, spectral nature|词性:noun

Etymology:
non- (prefix):  from Latin *non < ne “not” + *oinom  "one"
spectral: from Latin spectrum "appearance, image, apparition," from specere "to look at."
-ity (suffix):  from Latin -itas, used to form abstract nouns from adjectives.
