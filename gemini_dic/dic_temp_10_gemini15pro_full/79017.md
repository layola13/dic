gits:/ɡɪts/ | n. | 傻瓜，笨蛋，蠢货 | A foolish or contemptible person. |  He called him a gits for making such a stupid mistake. 他骂他笨蛋，因为他犯了这么愚蠢的错误。 | 近义词: idiot, fool, moron, imbecile, dolt | 反义词: genius, mastermind | 词性: 名词

词源:  Likely a shortened and altered form of "git" (itself a shortening of "beget," meaning to procreate), which became a derogatory term in British slang.  The added "s" likely doesn't pluralize the word but rather intensifies the insult, similar to how "wanker" can become "wankers."
