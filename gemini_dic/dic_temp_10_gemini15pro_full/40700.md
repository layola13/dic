conversive:/kənˈvɜːrsɪv/| adj.|可逆的，可倒置的，可变换的|Relating to or denoting a logical proposition that can be reversed without altering its truth value.  If "If P, then Q" is true, then its converse "If Q, then P" may or may not be true.|If P implies Q, then its converse is if Q implies P.  This converse may be true, or it may not.|近义词：reciprocal, inverse, interchangeable|反义词：non-conversive, irreversible|词性:形容词

Etymology:
From Late Latin *conversus, past participle of convertere “to turn around, change,” from com- "together" + vertere "to turn."
