jymold: /ˈdʒaɪmoʊld/ | n. | 模型，铸型，模具 | A jymold is a mold or template used for shaping or forming something. It's a  non-standard and rarely used term, likely a variation or misspelling of "gymold," itself an obsolete term for a "gimmal" or "gemel," meaning a paired or hinged object, often a ring.  Its usage in the sense of "mold" is likely due to a phonetic similarity and contextual inference. |  (Note: Due to the rarity of "jymold," constructing natural examples is difficult.  The following examples use it in a hypothetical context, assuming its intended meaning is "mold")  Example 1: The blacksmith used a jymold to create the iron ingot. 铁匠用模具制造铁锭。 Example 2:  They poured the molten metal into the jymold. 他们将熔化的金属倒入模具中。 | Near synonyms: mold, template, cast, matrix, die | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms for a physical object like a mold.  One could consider "original" or "prototype" as conceptually opposite.) | noun
