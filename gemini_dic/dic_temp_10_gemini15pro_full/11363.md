areolations: /əriːəˈleɪʃənz/  (This word likely doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries. It might be a misspelling, a neologism, or a technical term specific to a very niche field.)

If it were intended to be a word related to "areola" (the pigmented area around the nipple), a plausible (though not officially recognized) definition could be:

areolations: /əriːəˈleɪʃənz/ | n. | 乳晕变化/乳晕相关状态 |Changes or conditions related to the areola.  (This is a constructed definition based on the apparent root.) | Example: The doctor noted some areolations during the breast exam. 医生在乳房检查中注意到了一些乳晕变化。 | Synonym: (None readily available, would depend on the specific meaning intended) | Antonym: (None readily available) | Noun


Since "areolations" isn't a recognized word, the following examples use "changes in the areola" as a substitute.  Standard grammar rules apply to any proper noun or noun phrase.
