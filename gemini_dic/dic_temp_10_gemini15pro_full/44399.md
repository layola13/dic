From cross-grained + -ness. Cross-grained (adjective) comes from cross (adjective, meaning "contrary; transverse") + grained (adjective, referring to the direction of the fibers in wood).  The original meaning referred to wood with fibers running in different directions, making it difficult to work with. This meaning was then extended metaphorically to describe a person's difficult or contrary temperament.
