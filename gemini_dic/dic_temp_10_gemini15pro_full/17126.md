Etymology:
From battery (n.), from Old French baterie "act of beating, assault" (14c.), from batre "to beat," from Late Latin battere, from Latin battuere "to beat, strike, fight," frequentative of batere "to beat, strike" (from PIE root *bhau- "to strike"). The sense development is from notion of a group of cannons acting together (1530s), hence "a number of similar articles or devices grouped or used together" (1630s), then to "a set of connected electrochemical cells" (1748), then shortened to the usual singular form (1880s).
