词源:

From non- (prefix meaning "not") + congruent + -ly (adverbial suffix).  Congruent itself comes from Latin *congruentem*, present participle of congruere ("to agree, correspond"), from com- ("together") + -gruere (related to the Greek gruos ("crane, a bird that flies in formation"), suggesting an image of things coming together or fitting well).
