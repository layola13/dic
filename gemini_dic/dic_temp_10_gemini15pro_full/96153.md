词源:
From Old French endenter ("to notch, to furnish with teeth," also "to bind by indenture"), from dent ("tooth"), from Latin dens (genitive dentis) ("tooth").  The original indentures were written in duplicate on the same sheet, and then cut apart in a zigzag or toothed pattern.  The two copies could then be matched up again to prove their authenticity.
来自古法语 endenter（“刻痕，装上牙齿”，也指“通过契约约束”），来自 dent（“牙齿”），来自拉丁语 dens（所有格 dentis）（“牙齿”）。最初的契约是在同一张纸上写两份，然后沿着锯齿形或齿状图案剪开。然后可以将两份副本再次匹配以证明其真实性。
