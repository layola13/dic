"gllc" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible that it's an acronym, abbreviation, or a misspelling.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "**will**", which sometimes gets abbreviated informally, I can provide that:


will /wɪl/ | modal verb, noun | 将要; 意志; 遗嘱 |  Expresses future intent or a prediction about the future. As a noun, it refers to a person's determination or a legal document outlining inheritance. | I will go to the store tomorrow.  我明天会去商店。 | synonyms: shall, intend, going to | antonyms: refuse, won't, shan't | verb/noun
