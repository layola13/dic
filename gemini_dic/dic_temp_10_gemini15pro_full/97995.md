词源:  From in- + offensive + -ness.  "In-"  is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".  "Offensive" comes from the Old French *offensif*, from the Latin *offensus*, past participle of *offendere* "to strike against, offend." "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns expressing a state, quality, or condition.
