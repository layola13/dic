PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Outcursing" is not typically used in set phrases.  It's more of a descriptive verb used in specific contexts.


注意事项:
This word isn't commonly used and might be considered informal or even vulgar.  While technically correct grammatically, using more common synonyms like "curse vehemently" or "berate" might be preferable in most situations.  It appears to be a relatively recent coinage, potentially blending "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) with "cursing."  Therefore, its etymology is essentially derived from the common word "curse" and the prefix "out-".
