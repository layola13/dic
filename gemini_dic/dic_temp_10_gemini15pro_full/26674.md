词源：
The origin of "cad" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's shortened from "caddie," originally referring to university students who hired themselves out as errand runners.  Another theory links it to the French word "cadet," meaning younger son, often implying someone of lesser social standing who might resort to less honorable means. Over time, the term evolved to describe someone who behaves dishonestly, especially in matters of love or money.
