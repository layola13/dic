ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *additīvus*, from additus (past participle of addō "I add"), from ad- "to" + dō "I give".

USAGE->
The concept of additivity is frequently used in mathematics, statistics, physics, chemistry, and pharmacology.  Here are some examples in different contexts:

Mathematics:
The area of a rectangle is additive with respect to its sides.  矩形的面积相对于其边长是可加的。
The logarithm function turns multiplication into addition, exhibiting a form of additivity. 对数函数将乘法转化为加法，展现出一种可加性。


Statistics:
If events are independent, their probabilities are additive. 如果事件是独立的，它们的概率是可加的。
Additive models are used in statistical analysis to examine the cumulative effect of multiple predictors.  加性模型用于统计分析，以检验多个预测变量的累积效应。


Physics:
Extensive properties like mass and volume exhibit additivity.  质量和体积等广延性质具有可加性。
The total energy of a system is often the additive sum of its kinetic and potential energies.  一个系统的总能量通常是其动能和势能的加和。


Chemistry:
The molar mass of a compound is the additive sum of the atomic masses of its constituent elements.  化合物的摩尔质量是其组成元素原子质量的加和。
The absorbance of a solution at a specific wavelength is often additive with respect to the concentrations of absorbing species.  溶液在特定波长下的吸光度通常与其吸收物质的浓度成正比。


Pharmacology:
The combined effect of two drugs with additive effects is equal to the sum of their individual effects.  两种具有累加效应的药物的联合效应等于它们各自效应的总和。
Drug interactions can lead to deviations from additivity, such as synergism or antagonism.  药物相互作用会导致偏离可加性，例如协同作用或拮抗作用。



PHRASE->
additivity of effects  效应的可加性
principle of additivity  可加性原理
check for additivity  检查可加性
lack of additivity  缺乏可加性
deviations from additivity  偏离可加性
