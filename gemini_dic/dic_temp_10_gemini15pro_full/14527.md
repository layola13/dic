词源：
From average + -ness.  "Average" comes from Old French avarie "damage to ship or cargo," from Italian avaria, from Arabic 'awariya "damaged goods."  The meaning shifted from "damage assessment" to a "distribution of costs of damages" to a more general sense of "medial quantity." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
