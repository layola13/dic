ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *affecten*, from Old French *affecter*, from Latin *affectare* "to strive after, aspire to, aim at; to be disposed or inclined," frequentative of *afficere* "to do something to, influence, affect," from *ad-* "to" + *facere* "to do, make." The meaning shifted from "to strive for" to "to pretend to" in the 17th century.
