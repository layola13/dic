ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + sorrowful.  "Over-" acts as an intensifying prefix, meaning "excessively" or "too much."  "Sorrowful" comes from "sorrow" (meaning sadness or grief) + "-ful" (a suffix meaning "full of" or "characterized by").  Therefore, "oversorrowful" literally means "too full of sorrow."
