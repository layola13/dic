词源:
From Old English *dora, from Proto-Germanic *dūron, from Proto-Indo-European *dʰew- (“to flow, run”). Related to Old High German toro (“drone bee”), Greek θόρυβος (thórubos, “noise, tumult”), Sanskrit धावति (dhāvati, “runs”). The sense development is perhaps from the buzzing sound made by the insect.
