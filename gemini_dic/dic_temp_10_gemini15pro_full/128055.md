neros:/ˈnɛrɔs/| n. | 尼禄（Nero的复数形式，通常不使用） | Nero was a Roman emperor.  Nero is often associated with tyranny and extravagance. The plural form "neros" is grammatically correct but rarely used, as we don't usually talk about multiple emperors named Nero in the same context.|  It would be unusual to say "The neros of history were..." (referring to multiple emperors hypothetically named Nero).  We would more likely refer to them individually or use a descriptive phrase. | 近义词: emperors, rulers | 反义词:  subjects, citizens | noun
