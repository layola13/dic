词源:  From flat-footed + -ness.  Flat-footed itself comes from "flat foot," referring to a condition where the arch of the foot collapses, causing the entire sole to touch the ground. This physical characteristic was then metaphorically extended to describe someone lacking grace or agility, both physically and mentally.
