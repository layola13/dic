Etymology:  "Hi-hat" is a shortening of "high-hat cymbal," referring to its position higher up on the drum kit than other cymbals. The term "high-hat" itself may have originated from the slang term "high-hat," meaning snobbish or aloof, possibly due to the perceived sophistication of jazz drummers who popularized its use.
