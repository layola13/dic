PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "futurely" due to its archaic nature.  Since it is rarely used, it doesn't form part of established phrases. It's better to use its modern equivalents in phrases. For example, instead of trying to force "futurely" into a phrase,  use "in the future," "later," or other synonyms.
