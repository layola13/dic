Etymology:
From Late Middle English *in memorially, from in + memorially ("from memory, in memory; within the bounds of memory"), from Anglo-Norman memorial, Old French memorial ("serving as a reminder, commemorative") and directly from Late Latin memoriālis, from Latin memoria ("memory").  The sense development was "from/within memory" > "from time beyond memory" > "since ancient times". Surface analysis would suggest a derivation from immemorial + -ly, but this is not the case.
