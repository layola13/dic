词源: From "dippy" + "-ness". "Dippy" originated in the late 19th century, likely as a slang term suggesting being slightly crazy or eccentric, possibly related to "dipsomania" (an uncontrollable craving for alcohol) or the act of dipping one's head.  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, denoting a state or quality.
