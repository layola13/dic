Etymology:
From Middle English *dwellen*, from Old Norse *dvelja* (“to linger, delay, tarry”), from Proto-Germanic *dweljaną* (“to hinder, delay, lead astray”), from Proto-Indo-European *dʰwelh₁- (“to confuse, lead astray”).  Cognate with Old English *dwelian* (“to go astray, err”), Middle High German *twellen* (“to hinder”), Old Saxon *dwalōn* (“to deceive”).  More distantly related to Old English *dol* (“foolish, erring”).  The meaning shifted from "delay, tarry" to "reside" in Middle English.
