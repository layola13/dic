ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *anemōnē*, from Ancient Greek ἀνεμώνη (*anemōnē*)  "windflower," from ἄνεμος (*ánemos*) "wind" (akin to Latin *animus* "spirit, soul") + -ώνη (-ōnē), a female patronymic suffix.  So called because it was thought to open only when the wind blows.  The sea anemone gets its name from its resemblance to the terrestrial flower.
