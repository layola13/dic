adjective
倒生的，双向的，两侧的
(of an ovule) inverted so that the micropyle and funicle are close together.  The ovule is curved in such a way that the micropyle is near the hilum and chalaza.
例句：The amphitropous ovule is common in many flowering plants.  倒生胚珠在许多开花植物中很常见。

例句：The botanist identified the ovule as amphitropous due to its characteristic curvature.  植物学家根据其特征曲率将胚珠鉴定为倒生的。
近义词：anatropous, campylotropous (related ovule types, but not synonymous in orientation)
反义词：orthotropous (straight ovule)
词性: adjective
