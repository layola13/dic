ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "keel," meaning to turn over on its side, as a ship might.  The verb "keel" comes from the Old Norse "kjóll," meaning "ship."  The modern usage related to the Keeling Curve derives from Charles David Keeling, the scientist who initiated the measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa Observatory.
