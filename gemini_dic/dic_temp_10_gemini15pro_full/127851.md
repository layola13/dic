nempne:  *This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries.*  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis. It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant another word?  If you can provide more context or a possible correct spelling, I can offer a proper analysis.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word.  If so, without more context about its intended meaning, I cannot provide an analysis.
* **A technical term or slang:** Specific to a particular field or community.  Again, more context is needed.
* **A proper noun:**  The name of a person, place, or thing.  If so, standard dictionary definitions would not apply.

Since I cannot analyze "nempne," I will provide the requested format with the word "what" as a demonstration.
