opcode: /ˈɒpkəʊd/ (UK) /ˈɑːpkəʊd/ (US) | n. | 操作码 | A code representing an operation that a computer can perform. |  The opcode tells the CPU what operation to execute.  操作码告诉CPU要执行什么操作。 |  instruction code, operation code |  N/A | noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The opcode specifies the instruction. 操作码指定指令。
Each opcode corresponds to a specific action. 每个操作码对应一个特定的动作。


现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The CPU is fetching the opcode. CPU正在获取操作码。
The system is decoding the opcode. 系统正在解码操作码。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The program has executed the opcode. 程序已经执行了操作码。
The CPU has fetched the opcode from memory.  CPU已经从内存中获取了操作码。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The computer has been processing opcodes for hours.  计算机已经处理操作码好几个小时了。
The system has been fetching and decoding opcodes continuously. 系统一直在连续地获取和解码操作码。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program executed the opcode successfully. 程序成功地执行了操作码。
The CPU fetched the opcode from memory. CPU从内存中获取了操作码。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The CPU was processing the opcode when the error occurred.  当错误发生时，CPU正在处理操作码。
The system was decoding the opcode at that time. 系统当时正在解码操作码。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had already executed the opcode before the error occurred.  在错误发生之前，程序已经执行了操作码。
The CPU had fetched the opcode before the interrupt. CPU在中断之前已经获取了操作码。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The system had been processing opcodes for hours before it crashed. 系统崩溃前已经处理操作码好几个小时了。
The CPU had been fetching and decoding opcodes continuously before the power outage.  断电前CPU一直在连续地获取和解码操作码。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will execute the opcode next. 程序下一步将执行操作码。
The CPU will fetch the opcode from the instruction register. CPU将从指令寄存器中获取操作码。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The CPU will be processing the opcode at that time. CPU届时将正在处理操作码。
The system will be decoding the opcode during the next cycle.  系统将在下一个周期中解码操作码。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the cycle, the CPU will have executed the opcode. 到周期结束时，CPU将已经执行了操作码。
The program will have processed all the opcodes by tomorrow. 到明天，程序将已经处理了所有的操作码。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the system will have been processing opcodes for a month.  到下周，系统将已经处理操作码一个月了。
The CPU will have been fetching and decoding opcodes continuously for several hours by the time the task is complete.  到任务完成时，CPU将已经连续获取和解码操作码几个小时了。



虚拟语气:
If the opcode were different, the result would be different.  如果操作码不同，结果也会不同。
If I knew the opcode, I could tell you what instruction it represents. 如果我知道操作码，我就能告诉你它代表什么指令。


被动语态:
The opcode is fetched by the CPU.  操作码由CPU获取。
The instruction is determined by the opcode. 指令由操作码决定。


疑问句:
What is the opcode for this instruction?  这条指令的操作码是什么？
What does this opcode represent? 这个操作码代表什么？


否定句:
This opcode does not represent a valid instruction.  这个操作码不代表有效指令。
The CPU cannot execute this opcode. CPU无法执行此操作码。




PHRASE->
invalid opcode = 无效操作码
fetch the opcode = 获取操作码
decode the opcode = 解码操作码
execute the opcode = 执行操作码
opcode table = 操作码表
