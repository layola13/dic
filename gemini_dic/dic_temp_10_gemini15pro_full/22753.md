From Middle English *bora(u)ge*, from Anglo-Norman *borage*, from Old French *borage*, *bourrache*, of uncertain origin. Possibly from Vulgar Latin *borrāgine* (unattested), from Late Latin *borrāgo, burrāgo*, perhaps from Latin *burra* (“rough wool, shaggy cloth”) (compare Italian *borra* (“wool refuse”)), referring to the hairy leaves of the plant. Alternatively, possibly from Arabic *أَبُو عَرَق* (*ʾabū ʿaraq*, literally “father of sweat”), referring to its sudorific properties.
