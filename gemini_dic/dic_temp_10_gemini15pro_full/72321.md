词源：From Old French *floter "to float, swim, drift," from Vulgar Latin *flottare, frequentative of Latin fluctuare "to move in waves, undulate, waver," from fluctus "wave, billow."  The sense development is from "to drift aimlessly" to "to wander from the right path" to "to treat with contempt." 来自古法语 *floter “漂浮、游泳、漂流”，源自通俗拉丁语 *flottare，是拉丁语 fluctuare 的重复形式，意为“波浪起伏、波动、摇摆”，来自 fluctus “波浪、巨浪”。其含义发展是从“漫无目的地漂流”到“偏离正道”再到“轻蔑对待”。
