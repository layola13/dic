Etymology:
Shortened form of  "conterfeit," from Old French "contrefait," past participle of "contrefaire"  meaning "to imitate, copy, forge," from "contre-" (against) + "faire" (to make).  The meaning shifted over time to focus on the deceptive nature of imitation, eventually leading to the current sense of "swindler" or "fraud."  The abbreviation "cont." comes directly from shortening "continued."
