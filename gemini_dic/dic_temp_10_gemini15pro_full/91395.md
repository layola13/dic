hydrotropism:/haɪˈdrɒtrəpɪzəm/ | n. | 向水性 | The directional growth of a plant root in response to a moisture gradient.  The roots grow towards the area of higher water concentration. | Example 1: The hydrotropism of the plant's roots ensured its survival during the drought. 植物根的向水性确保了其在干旱期间的生存。

Example 2:  Scientists are studying the mechanisms behind hydrotropism to develop drought-resistant crops. 科学家们正在研究向水性背后的机制，以开发抗旱作物。 | 近义词: No single perfect synonym, but related terms include: water-seeking, hydrotropic response | 反义词: No direct antonym | 词性: noun
