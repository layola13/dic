词源:

"gyp" and "gypper" are likely derived from "gypsy," historically associated with deceitful practices.  This etymology is considered pejorative and offensive, stemming from prejudiced stereotypes. While the connection to "gypsy" is probable, it’s important to avoid using the term due to its offensive nature.  Modern usage often replaces "gyp" and its derivatives with less problematic synonyms like "cheat," "swindle," or "defraud."
