kelvin-scale:/ˈkɛlvɪn skeɪl/| n.|开尔文温标；绝对温标|A temperature scale that begins at absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°F), where theoretically there is no molecular motion. Each degree represents the same quantity of heat as one degree Celsius.|The scientists measured the temperature using the Kelvin scale.|近义词:absolute temperature scale|反义词:Celsius scale, Fahrenheit scale|词性:noun

Etymology: Named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824–1907), a British physicist who developed the scale.
