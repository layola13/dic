The word "ansed" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis for it.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term specific to a niche field, or a neologism (newly coined word). If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.


However, since the prompt requests examples of various grammatical structures using "what," I will provide those below, assuming "what" functions as an interrogative pronoun or determiner:

what: /wʌt/ |pron. det.| 什么 | Used to ask for information specifying something or someone. | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | which, who | - | pronoun, determiner
