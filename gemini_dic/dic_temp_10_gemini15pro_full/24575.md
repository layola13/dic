brochantite:/broʊˈʃɑːnˌtaɪt/ /brɒˈʃænˌtaɪt/
n.|绿铜矾|A basic copper sulfate mineral, Cu₄SO₄(OH)₆, occurring in emerald-green crystals. It is formed by the oxidation of copper sulfide ores.|Brochantite is a relatively rare mineral, but can be found in oxidized zones of copper deposits.|近义词: antlerite, posnjakite|反义词: None (lacks a direct opposite as it's a specific mineral name)|词性:noun
