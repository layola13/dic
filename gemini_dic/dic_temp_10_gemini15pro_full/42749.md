词源: "countrier" is the comparative form of the adjective "country," ultimately derived from the Old French word "contree," which itself comes from the Latin word "contra," meaning "against" or "opposite."  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the land "opposite" or "lying outside" a city or town, hence "countryside."  The "-er" suffix is a comparative ending, indicating a greater degree of the quality described by the adjective.
