The word "examply" is not a standard English word.  It seems like a misspelling of "exemplarily," which is the adverb form of "exemplary."  Therefore, I will analyze "exemplarily."

exemplarily: /ɪɡˈzɛmplərɪli/ | adv. | exemplary地；值得效仿地；可作楷模地 | in a way that is exemplary; serving as a desirable model; commendably |  She behaved exemplarily in a difficult situation.  她在困境中表现堪称典范。|  He completed the project exemplarily, exceeding all expectations. 他出色地完成了项目，超出了所有预期。 | 近义词: perfectly, ideally, commendably, flawlessly | 反义词: poorly, inadequately, badly, shoddily | 词性: adverb

词源: From Latin exemplum ("example") + -ary (suffix forming adjectives) + -ly (suffix forming adverbs).
