There's no English word "kuo".  It's possible you meant "quo" (as in status quo), or perhaps a word from another language transliterated as "kuo".  Since the prompt requests information on "kuo", and I cannot find it in any English dictionary, I will instead provide information for the word "what," which is commonly used in questions and is central to the examples provided in the prompt.
