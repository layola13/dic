词源:
From Middle English *forfenden, from Old English forfēndan (“to forbid, prohibit, avert, defend against”), from for- (“away, against”) + fēndan (“to put off, set aside, turn away, avert, defend”).

注意事项:  "forfend" is a rather formal and somewhat archaic word, not commonly used in modern everyday English.  It often appears in literary contexts or in situations where a heightened sense of formality or dramatic effect is desired.
