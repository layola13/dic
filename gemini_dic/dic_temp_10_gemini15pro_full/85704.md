PHRASE->
*Not applicable as "haves" is a conjugated form, not a base word for phrases.*

词源: "Haves" comes from the Old English verb *habban*, meaning "to have" or "to hold."  It evolved through Middle English *haven* to its modern form.  The -s ending marks the third person singular present tense.


注意事项:
"Haves" is grammatically unusual and generally considered non-standard English. While technically the plural of "has," its use is limited and often sounds awkward.  It's more common to rephrase the sentence using "have" with a plural subject.  For instance, instead of "The boys haves many toys," it's better to say "The boys have many toys."
