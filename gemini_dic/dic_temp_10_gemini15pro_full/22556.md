词源:
From Middle English *boosten, *bosten (“to boast, make a loud noise”), probably from a Scandinavian source, such as Old Norse *bauta, *bautast (“to strike, beat”), or perhaps a blend of both. Related to Old Norse bauta-steinn (“boundary stone”).  The semantic shift may be influenced by the idea of "pushing" or "lifting."
