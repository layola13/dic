ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *deschant*, from *deschanter* "to sing a descant," from *des-* "down from" (from Latin *de-*) + *chanter* "to sing" (from Latin *cantare*).  The sense shift from "singing *down from*" to "singing *above*" likely occurred due to the descant being perceived as a separate, higher melodic line.
