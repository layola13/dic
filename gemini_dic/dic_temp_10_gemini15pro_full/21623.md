词源:  "Blurb" originates from the 1907 creation by American humorist Gelett Burgess. He created a dust jacket for his book "Are You a Bromide?" featuring a promotional quote attributed to a fictional actress named "Miss Belinda Blurb." The term quickly caught on and became synonymous with short promotional descriptions.
