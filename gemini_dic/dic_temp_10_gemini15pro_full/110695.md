linear-momentum:/ˈlɪniər moʊˈmɛntəm/| n.|线性动量|A vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. It represents the quantity of motion an object has.  A larger momentum means an object is harder to stop.|Example: The linear momentum of the truck was enormous due to its high speed and mass.  卡车由于速度和质量都很大，所以线性动量巨大。

Example:  A change in momentum requires a net force acting on the object.  动量的改变需要一个净力作用在物体上。|近义词:momentum, impetus|反义词:(No direct antonym, but a *loss* of momentum implies a decrease in velocity or mass.)|词性:noun
