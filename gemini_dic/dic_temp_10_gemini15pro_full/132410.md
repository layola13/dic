nondensity:/nɑːnˈdɛnsɪti/ | n. | 非密度，非稠密性 | The nondensity of the material makes it suitable for insulation.  这种材料的非稠密性使其适合用作绝缘体。 | The nondensity of the population in this area contributes to the tranquility.  该地区人口的非稠密性有助于这里的宁静。 | 近义词: rarity, sparseness | 反义词: density, thickness | 词性: 名词

词源: non- + density

non-:  prefix meaning "not," from Old French non-, from Latin non "not," originally ne oinom (ne "not" + oinom "one thing"), from PIE root *ne- "not."

density: from Late Latin densitatem (nominative densitas) "thickness, closeness, crowded condition," from Latin densus "thick, crowded, dense," from PIE root *denes- "thick."
