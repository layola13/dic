词源:  "Atrans" appears to be a non-standard or newly coined word possibly intended to be synonymous with "African."  It doesn't have a recognized etymology in established dictionaries. It's plausible it emerged in specific communities or contexts but lacks widespread usage.  While "Afro-" is a common prefix denoting African origin (e.g., Afro-American, Afro-Caribbean), "atrans" is not a standard formation.  For clarity and accuracy, using "African" is recommended in formal writing and general communication.
