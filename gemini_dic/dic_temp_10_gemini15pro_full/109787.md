levoglucoses:/ˌliːvoʊˈɡluːkoʊsiz/ | n. |左旋葡聚糖|A type of glucose derivative formed during the pyrolysis of cellulose and starch.  It is a chiral molecule, meaning it exists in two forms that are mirror images of each other.  Only the "levo" form is typically found in nature. |Levoglucoses are important markers for biomass burning in atmospheric aerosols. 左旋葡聚糖是大气气溶胶中生物质燃烧的重要标志物。| The presence of levoglucoses in the sample indicates the burning of plant material.  样品中左旋葡聚糖的存在表明植物材料的燃烧。 |Synonyms:  1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose (more technical term) | Antonyms:  N/A (no direct antonym, as it's a specific chemical compound)|noun
