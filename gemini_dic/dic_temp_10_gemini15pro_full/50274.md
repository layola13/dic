dephlegmator:/ˌdiːˈflɛɡmeɪtər/ | n. | 冷凝器，分馏器 | A device used in distillation to condense vapors and return some of the condensate to the still, promoting fractionation and increasing the purity of the distillate.  It selectively condenses the less volatile components of a vapor, allowing the more volatile components to pass through. | The dephlegmator increased the efficiency of the distillation process. 分馏器提高了蒸馏过程的效率。

The chemist carefully adjusted the temperature of the dephlegmator. 化学家仔细地调整了分馏器的温度。 | 近义词：condenser, reflux condenser, fractionating column | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology: From de- (Latin, "down from, away, off") + phlegm (Greek, "phlegma," meaning inflammation, humor caused by heat) + -ator (Latin, forming nouns of agent). Originally referred to a device thought to remove excess "phlegm" or watery humor from the body.
