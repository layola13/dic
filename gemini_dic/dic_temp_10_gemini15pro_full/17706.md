词源:  "bedazzle" comes from "dazzle," which originated from the Middle English "dasen," meaning "to grow dim" or "be dazed." The prefix "be-" intensifies the meaning, creating "bedazzle," meaning "to dazzle intensely or excessively."  "Bedazzlements" is the noun form, referring to things that bedazzle. "dazzle" 源于中古英语 "dasen"，意为“变暗”或“茫然”。前缀 "be-" 加强了其含义，构成 "bedazzle"，意为“强烈地或过度地使眼花缭乱”。"Bedazzlements" 是其名词形式，指令人眼花缭乱的事物。
