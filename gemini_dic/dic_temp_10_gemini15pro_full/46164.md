词源：From French *cynique*, or directly from Latin *cynicus*, from Ancient Greek *κυνικός (kunikós)* (dog-like, currish, cynical), from *κύων (kúōn)* (dog).  The Cynics were a school of ancient Greek philosophers. Their name derives from *Kynosarges*, the name of the gymnasium where they met, which may mean "white dog".  Their philosophy rejected conventional social values and advocated a simple, natural life.  Over time, the term "cynic" came to refer to someone who believes that people are motivated purely by self-interest.
