apogeotropism:/əˌpoʊdʒiːˈɒtrəpɪzəm/| n. |背地性，负向地性|The upward growth of plant stems is an example of negative geotropism, also known as apogeotropism. 植物茎的向上生长是负向地性的一个例子，也称为背地性。|例句：The apogeotropism of the plant's stem allowed it to grow towards the sunlight.  植物茎的背地性使其能够朝着阳光生长。

例句：Apogeotropism ensures that the shoots of a plant grow upwards, maximizing their exposure to light. 背地性确保植物的枝条向上生长，最大限度地接触光线。|近义词：negative geotropism|反义词:geotropism, positive geotropism|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
