词源:  "Over-" (prefix meaning "excessive") + "care" (noun) + "'s" (possessive suffix, indicating the effects or consequences of over-care).  The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" with the noun "care" and adding the possessive suffix "'s". This construction highlights the negative consequences resulting from excessive care.  While not a standard dictionary entry, it's a grammatically correct formation understandable in context.
