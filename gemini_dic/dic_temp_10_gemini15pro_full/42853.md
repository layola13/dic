Etymology:  Courtelle is a trademarked name coined by Courtaulds, a British textile company. It doesn't have a traditional etymology in the same way common words do.  It likely draws inspiration from "court," suggesting quality and perhaps a royal connection, and a softened "telle" possibly echoing textiles or similar-sounding French words related to weaving.
