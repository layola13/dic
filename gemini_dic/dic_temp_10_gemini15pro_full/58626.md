词源:  While a definitive etymology isn't readily available in standard dictionaries, "dumal" likely arises from a combination or alteration of existing words related to darkness or gloom, potentially drawing influence from words like "dull," "dim," and "murky" to evoke a sense of subdued light and associated melancholy.  It could also be a regional or archaic term.  Further research in specialized etymological resources might reveal a more precise origin.
