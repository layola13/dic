注意事项:  "Heshe" is not a standard English pronoun and its usage is relatively rare.  While intended to be inclusive, it can sound awkward and is often replaced by "they" as the singular they is becoming more accepted.  Using the person's name or rephrasing the sentence to avoid pronouns altogether can also be a good strategy.
