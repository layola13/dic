clothes's: /kloʊðzɪz/ | n. (non-standard, often considered incorrect) | 衣服（属格，通常被认为是不正确的） |  This form is generally considered incorrect and should be avoided.  The possessive of "clothes" is usually expressed by "clothes" itself, as it's a plural noun that doesn't typically take a possessive 's.  | Example: INCORRECT: The clothes's color was faded.  衣服的颜色褪色了。 | Synonym: (Possessive meaning not applicable to "clothes" itself, but synonyms for "clothes" include) garments, attire, apparel | Antonym: (Not applicable) | noun


Etymology: "Clothes" comes from Old English "clāþas," the plural of "clāþ," meaning "cloth" or "garment."  The incorrect addition of -'s likely stems from a misunderstanding of possessive forms.
