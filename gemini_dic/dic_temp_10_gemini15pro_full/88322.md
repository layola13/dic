词源:
"Hippinesses" is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard pluralization of "happiness," likely created for emphasis or poetic effect. "Happiness" comes from the Middle English "happinesse," derived from "happy" plus the suffix "-ness." "Happy" itself traces back to the Old Norse "happ" (luck, chance).
