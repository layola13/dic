"Deral" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term specific to a certain field, a proper noun (like a name), or simply not a real word. Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis for it.

However, if you meant **federal**, then the analysis is as follows:


federal: /ˈfɛdərəl/ (US) /ˈfɛd(ə)rəl/ (UK)| adj.| 联邦的；联邦制的；联邦政府的 |  Relating to a system of government in which several states form a unity but remain independent in internal affairs. | The federal government is responsible for national defense. 联邦政府负责国防。 |  Federal agents investigated the crime. 联邦探员调查了这起犯罪。 |  national, central | local, state | adjective
