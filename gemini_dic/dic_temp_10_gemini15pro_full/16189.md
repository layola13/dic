From Old French *banqueroute* (Modern French *banqueroute*) "bankruptcy," literally "broken bench," from Italian *banca rotta*, from *banca* "bench, moneychanger's table" + *rotta* "broken." Moneychangers in the marketplace did their business at a bench or table. When a moneychanger became insolvent, his bench or table was broken as a sign that he was no longer in business.
