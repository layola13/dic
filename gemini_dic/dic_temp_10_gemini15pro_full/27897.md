注意事项:

*  "Cantar" as a verb is somewhat archaic in English. "Sing" is generally preferred.
*  "Cantar" as a noun is primarily used in Spanish and Portuguese.  Its usage in English is limited, generally to literary or specialized contexts.
* The conjugated forms provided use "-ing" endings for the continuous tenses. However, alternative forms using the auxiliary "be" + "to cantar" are also acceptable (e.g., "She is cantar-ing" or "She is to cantar").
