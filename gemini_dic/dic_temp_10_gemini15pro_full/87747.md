The word "heyens" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word), I can try to provide more information.

Assuming you meant "happens," here's the breakdown:

happen:/ˈhæpən/| v. |发生，碰巧|Something unexpected happened. 意外的事情发生了。| occur, take place |prevent|verb
happen:/ˈhæpən/| v. |发生，碰巧|The accident happened so quickly. 事故发生得太快了。|arise, transpire|stop|verb
