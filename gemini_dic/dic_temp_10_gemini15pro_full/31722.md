From Old English *cēap (attested only in compounds such as cēapmann "merchant, tradesman"), from Proto-Germanic *kaupō (source also of Old Saxon kōp "bargaining, price, purchase", Old Frisian kāp "purchase, price, business", Dutch koop "purchase, bargain", Old High German kouf "purchase", German Kauf "purchase"), from Proto-Indo-European *kōup- "to strike, hit, barter".  The original sense was "bargain, business transaction".
