词源:  "anchor" originally referred to the anchor of a ship, providing stability.  In broadcasting, the "anchorman" became the central figure, providing stability and guiding the news program.  The suffix "-man" denotes a male person.  Later, "anchorwoman" or simply "anchor" became common for female anchors, and "anchor" itself can be used gender-neutrally.
