ETYMOLOGY->
"Freegan" is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan".  It emerged in the mid-1990s, likely evolving from the anti-globalization and anarchist movements.  While often associated with veganism due to shared ethical concerns about animal welfare and environmental impact, freeganism is distinct and focuses primarily on reducing waste and opposing consumerism.
