ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *nearwe, from Proto-Germanic *narwaz ("narrow"), from Proto-Indo-European *ner- ("on the left; below").  Related to Old Norse narr ("narrow"), Old High German narro ("narrow"), and Latin nervus ("sinew, tendon").  The semantic shift from "left/below" to "narrow" likely occurred through the association with confined spaces.
