ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *lyft (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *liftaz (“left, weak”), from Proto-Indo-European *leip- (“to stick, adhere; to be left over”). Cognate with Old Frisian left (“left”), Dutch links (“left”), German links (“left”), Old Norse lyft (“left hand”).  The sense development is from the less dexterous hand being considered “weak” or “remaining” after the dominant hand is employed.
