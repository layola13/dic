PHRASE->
(Currently, there are no common phrases specifically using "equirotal." This is because it's a highly technical term primarily used in engineering contexts.  It is more likely to be found within a descriptive phrase like "equirotal motion of the gears" or "equirotal speed of the blades," rather than as part of a set phrase.)
