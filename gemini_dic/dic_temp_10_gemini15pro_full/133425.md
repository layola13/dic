Etymology:
From non- + farcical.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "farcical" comes from the word "farce," which originates from the Old French word "farsir" meaning "to stuff."  Originally referring to stuffing added to liturgical texts, it later came to mean a comedic interlude in a play, and eventually, a broad, often absurd comedy.
