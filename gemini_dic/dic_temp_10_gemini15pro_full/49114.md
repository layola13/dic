ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *deintevous*, from Anglo-Norman *deinteus, deintos*, from Old French *daintos, daintius*, from *deintié* (“delicacy, pleasure, value”), from Latin *dignitās* (“worthiness, dignity”).  The shift in meaning from “worthy, valuable” to “delicate, exquisite” likely occurred through association with refined tastes and appreciation of beauty.
