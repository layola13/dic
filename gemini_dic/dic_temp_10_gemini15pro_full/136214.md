词源:  Comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") added to "relinquishment," which itself derives from the verb "relinquish."  "Relinquish" traces back to the Old French "relinquir" meaning "to leave behind." Ultimately, its roots lie in the Latin "relinquere," composed of "re-" (back) and "linquere" (to leave).
