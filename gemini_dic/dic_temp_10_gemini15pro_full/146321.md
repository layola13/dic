PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in set phrases.  It's primarily descriptive and its adverbial nature makes it less common in fixed expressions.)


词源: over- + feminine + -ly.  "Over-" acts as an intensifier, indicating excess, while "-ly" transforms the adjective "feminine" into an adverb.  The root "feminine" ultimately comes from Latin "femina" meaning "woman."
