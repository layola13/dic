词源: "misaver" is a relatively recent coinage, likely formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning "badly" or "wrongly") with "saver."  Although "mis-" usually implies a negative connotation, in this context, it seems to suggest excessive or perhaps misplaced saving, rather than simply being a bad saver.  The word isn't recognized by all dictionaries, indicating it's still gaining acceptance in common usage.
