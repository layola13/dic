Etymology:  "Midgetism" is a relatively recent term, derived from the word "midget," which itself is now considered offensive and outdated.  "Midget" historically referred to a person of unusually short stature, often specifically those with dwarfism who were exhibited in circuses or sideshows. The suffix "-ism" is added to indicate a system of prejudice or discrimination.  Thus, "midgetism" signifies the societal biases and discriminatory practices directed towards individuals with dwarfism.
