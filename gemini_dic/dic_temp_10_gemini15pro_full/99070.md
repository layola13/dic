interattritions:/ˌɪntərəˈtrɪʃənz/ | n. |相互摩擦，相互损耗| The interattritions of the gears caused the machine to malfunction. 齿轮之间的相互摩擦导致机器故障。| The constant interattritions of the rocks smoothed their surfaces over time.  岩石不断的相互摩擦随着时间的推移使其表面光滑。 |近义词：abrasion, friction, wear, erosion|反义词: accretion, deposition |词性: noun


Etymology:  "inter-" (Latin, meaning "between, among") + "attrition" (from Latin "atterere,"  meaning "to rub against, to wear down").  Thus, it literally means "rubbing between or among."
