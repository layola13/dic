词源：Cameo comes from the Italian word *cammeo*, which likely derived from the Medieval Latin *camaeus*. The ultimate origin is uncertain, but it may be related to the Arabic word *jamā’*, meaning "to gather" or "assemble," possibly referring to the layering of different coloured materials used in creating cameos.
