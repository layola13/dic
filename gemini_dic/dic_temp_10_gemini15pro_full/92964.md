/ɪdf/ |abbr.| 逆文档频率 (inverse document frequency) | A measure of how much information the word provides, that is, whether the term is common or rare across all documents.  It's used in information retrieval and text mining. | IDF is calculated as log(N/df) where N is the total number of documents and df is the number of documents containing the term. | 近义词: N/A | 反义词: N/A | abbreviation
