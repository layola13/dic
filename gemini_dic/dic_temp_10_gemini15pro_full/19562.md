ETYMOLOGY->
"big-timer" is a compound word formed from "big" and "timer". "Big" refers to size or importance, and "timer" originally referred to a timekeeper in sports, especially boxing.  Over time, "timer" evolved to mean someone of importance or influence, leading to the compound "big-timer". The term gained popularity in American slang in the early 20th century.
