注意事项:  While "oht" is a valid phonetic spelling, it's not a formally recognized word.  It represents a vocalization, similar to "oh" or "ouch."  Therefore, providing antonyms, robust etymology, and complex grammatical examples is difficult.  This response focuses on demonstrating usage in various tenses and phrases, prioritizing practical application over strict adherence to potentially inapplicable rules for interjections.
