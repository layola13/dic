ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *brut* "dull, stupid, rough, unpolished, raw, coarse," from Latin *brutus* "dull, senseless, irrational," figuratively "brutish, animal," literally "heavy, weighty," perhaps from PIE root *gwer- "heavy." The sense shifted from "irrational" to "lacking human sensibility, cruel."
