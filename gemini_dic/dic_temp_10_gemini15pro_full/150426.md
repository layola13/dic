panspermia:/pænˈspɜːrmiə/
n.| 泛种论|The hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, and also by spacecraft carrying unintended contamination by microorganisms.|Some scientists believe that panspermia could explain the origin of life on Earth.|近义词:exogenesis|反义词:abiogenesis|词性:noun

Etymology:
From Ancient Greek πᾶν (pân, “all”) + σπέρμα (spérma, “seed”).  Coined by the German biologist Hermann Richter in 1865.
