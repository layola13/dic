deflectionize:/dɪˈflɛkʃənaɪz/ | v. |  使偏斜，使转向 | To cause something to deflect or deviate from its original course. | The magnetic field deflectionizes the charged particles. 磁场使带电粒子偏转。 |  The prism deflectionizes the light beam. 棱镜使光束偏转。 |  redirect, divert, deviate | maintain, preserve | verb

ETYMOLOGY->
From "deflect" (verb, meaning to turn aside from a straight course) + "-ize" (suffix used to form verbs from adjectives or nouns, often meaning "to make" or "to cause to be"). "Deflect" comes from the Latin "deflectere," meaning "to bend down" or "to turn aside," from "de-" (away from) + "flectere" (to bend).
