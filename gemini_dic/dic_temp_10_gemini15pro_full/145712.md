PHRASE->
(Not applicable for adverbs. Phrases are typically formed with nouns, verbs, and adjectives.)


词源:
From "over-" (excessively) + "covetous" (desiring something belonging to another) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix). "Covetous" comes from Old French "coveitos," from Latin "cupidus" (eager, desirous), from "cupere" (to desire).
