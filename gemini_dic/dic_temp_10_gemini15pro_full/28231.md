From Old French cabestan, from Old Provençal capestan, from Late Latin capistrum "halter," from Latin caput "head."  The original capstans were powered by men pushing on bars inserted into holes in the top.  The image of men pushing the bars around in a circle is reminiscent of animals with halters around their heads being led in a circle.
