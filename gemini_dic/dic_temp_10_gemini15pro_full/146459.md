词源:
From over- + frightening, from fright + -en + -ing.  "Over-" acts as an intensifier, meaning "excessively" or "too much".  "Fright" comes from the Middle English "fryght," meaning "sudden fear." "-en" is a suffix that forms verbs from adjectives or nouns (like frighten from fright).  "-ing" is a suffix that forms present participles and gerunds, and here transforms the verb "frighten" into an adjective describing something that causes fright.
