词源：From French *grotesque* "comical, absurd," from Italian *grottesco* "of a cave," from *grotta* "cave," from Late Latin *grupta*, alteration of Latin *crypta* "underground vault" (see crypt). So called from the ancient paintings and decorations discovered in the 15th century in the underground chambers (believed to be caves) of Roman ruins, especially those of Nero's Golden House, which were full of bizarre combinations of human and animal forms and ornaments. The style was adopted by Renaissance artists, especially Raphael.
