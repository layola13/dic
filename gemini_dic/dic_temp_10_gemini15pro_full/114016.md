magmatisms:/ˈmæɡmətɪzəmz/ | n. | 岩浆作用；岩浆活动 |The process or processes by which magma is generated, migrates upward, and solidifies within the Earth's crust or is extruded onto the surface as lava. |  The magmatisms of the region have shaped the landscape dramatically. 该地区的岩浆活动极大地塑造了地貌。|  volcanic activity, igneous activity | sedimentation, metamorphism | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From magma + -ism. Magma comes from the Greek μάγμα (magma), meaning "thick unguent." The suffix "-ism" denotes a process, state, or condition.
