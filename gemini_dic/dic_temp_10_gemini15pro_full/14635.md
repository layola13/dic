avoidless:/əˈvɔɪdləs/
adj.
不可避免的
Unable to be avoided; inevitable.
The avoidless consequences of his actions finally caught up with him. 他行为的不可避免的后果最终降临到他身上。
近义词：inevitable, unavoidable, inescapable
反义词：avoidable, preventable
词性：形容词

词源：a- (not) + void (empty, null) + -less (without)  The word "avoidless" is formed by adding the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without") to the root word "void."  While "void" itself doesn't mean "avoid," the combination creates the meaning of "not able to be made void or empty of consequence," hence "unavoidable."
