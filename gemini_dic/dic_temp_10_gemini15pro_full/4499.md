albion:/ˈælbɪən/ | n. | Albion | An ancient and poetic name for Great Britain, specifically England.  It is ultimately derived from the Indo-European root meaning "white," likely referring to the white cliffs of Dover. |  Shakespeare used "Albion" in his plays to refer to England.  For example, in King Lear, he writes, "This precious stone set in the silver sea, / Which serves it in the office of a wall, / Or as a moat defensive to a house, / Against the envy of less happier lands, / This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, / This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, / Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, / Renowned for their deeds as far from home / As is the morning lark, or the proud swan, / That wings her way above the silver waves, / Is now leas'd out—I die pronouncing it— / Like to a tenement or pelting farm: / England, bound in with the triumphant sea, / Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege / Of watery Neptune, is now bound in / And pent within the girdle of these powers. / France, O, my France! When and ere thou wert king, / For the loved maid that now sits on thy knee, / From France to England I did give my being, / A pawn for her alliance." | synonyms: Britain, England, UK | antonyms: N/A | noun
