ETYMOLOGY->
From French antisémitique, from anti- + sémitique (“Semitic”), ultimately from Late Latin Semita (“Shem”).  Shem was one of the sons of Noah, traditionally considered the ancestor of the Semitic peoples.  The term was coined in the late 19th century to describe a modern form of hostility toward Jews, distinct from earlier religious prejudice.
