nondegenerateness:/ˌnɒndɪˈdʒɛnərətnəs/| n. |非退化性；非简并性|The state or quality of being nondegenerate; not degenerate.  It implies that something possesses its full or expected dimensionality, complexity, or functionality, and hasn't been reduced or simplified in a way that compromises its essential characteristics.|The nondegenerateness of the matrix is a crucial condition for the solution to exist.|近义词：full dimensionality, completeness, robustness|反义词：degeneracy, singularity, reducibility|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + degenerate + -ness.  "Degenerate" comes from Latin *degeneratus*, past participle of *degenerare* "to deteriorate," from *de-* "down from" + *genus* "race, stock, kind."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, denoting a state or quality.
