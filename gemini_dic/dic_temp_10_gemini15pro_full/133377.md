词源:  "nonextrications" is derived from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "extrication" (meaning "the act of freeing something from a constraint or difficulty").  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being able to be freed."  "Extrication" itself comes from the Latin "extricare," meaning "to disentangle."
