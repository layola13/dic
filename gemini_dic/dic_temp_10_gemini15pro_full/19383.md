bicallose:/baɪˈkæləʊs/ | adj. |胼胝质的；富含胼胝质的 | Relating to or containing callose, a plant polysaccharide.  Callose is a carbohydrate that is involved in plant cell wall formation and responses to stress.  The term "bicallose" suggests a structure or substance that is particularly rich in, or characterized by, the presence of callose. |  The sieve plates of the phloem became bicallose after infection. 感染后，韧皮部的筛板变得富含胼胝质。 |  Callosic | N/A | adjective
