mendeleviums:/ˌmɛndəˈlɛviəmz/
|n.|钔（放射性金属元素）|A synthetic radioactive metallic transuranic element of the actinide series, atomic number 101, symbol Md.  It is synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles.|Mendelevium is a highly radioactive element and its properties are not well studied. 钔是一种高放射性元素，其性质尚未得到很好的研究。|Mendelevium isotopes have very short half-lives. 钔同位素的半衰期很短。|近义词:  (As a transuranic element, it doesn't have true synonyms, but other transuranic elements like nobelium and lawrencium are related in terms of their position on the periodic table.) |反义词: None|词性:noun
