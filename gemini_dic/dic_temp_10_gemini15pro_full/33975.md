PHRASE->

(This word is rarely used in phrases, and its derogatory nature makes it unsuitable for casual conversation.  Therefore, providing common phrases is difficult.  Instead, I offer examples of how the word might appear in sentences that express similar sentiments.)

Don't be such a cissy! = 别这么胆小！
He called him a cissy for crying. = 他因为他哭而叫他胆小鬼.

注意事项:

This word is considered offensive and should be used with extreme caution.  It is often used to bully or belittle someone, particularly males, for perceived weakness.  Using more neutral and respectful language is always recommended.
