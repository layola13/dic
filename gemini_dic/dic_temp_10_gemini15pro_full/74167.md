ETYMOLOGY->
fountain (n.) + -less (suffix)
From Old French *fontane (Modern French fontaine), from Late Latin fontana "spring, source, fountain," noun use of fem. of fontanus "of a spring," from Latin fons (genitive fontis) "spring, fountain, source, well." The suffix -less is from Old English -lēas "free from, without," from Proto-Germanic *-lausaz, from PIE root *-leudh- "to grow up, sprout."
