HCFCs:/ˌeɪtʃ siː ɛf siːz/| n.|氢氯氟烃|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are a group of man-made organic compounds that contain hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon atoms. They are used as refrigerants, solvents, and blowing agents.  HCFCs are less damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs, but they are still potent greenhouse gases.|HCFCs were introduced as temporary replacements for CFCs.|近义词: refrigerants (制冷剂), blowing agents (发泡剂)|反义词:  None (没有明确的反义词，可以考虑自然制冷剂 natural refrigerants)|noun
