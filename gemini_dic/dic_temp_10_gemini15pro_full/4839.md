词源: "alicart" is a portmanteau of "Alibaba" and "cart," referring to the shopping cart feature commonly found on e-commerce platforms, particularly those associated with Alibaba.  It doesn't have a classical etymology like words with roots in Latin or Greek. It's a modern term coined for online shopping.
