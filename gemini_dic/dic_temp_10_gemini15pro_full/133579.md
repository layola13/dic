词源:  "nonflakilynesses" is derived from "flaky," which means unreliable or inconsistent.  The "non-" prefix negates this, making it mean reliable. The "-ness" suffix turns the adjective "nonflaky" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being nonflaky.  "Flaky" itself may be related to the idea of something flaking or breaking apart easily, suggesting instability.
