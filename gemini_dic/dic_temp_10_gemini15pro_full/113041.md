luminosity:/ˌluːmɪˈnɒsɪti/ | n. | 光度，明亮，光辉 | The luminosity of a star is its intrinsic brightness.  一颗恒星的光度是它的固有亮度。 | The luminosity of the screen is adjustable. 屏幕的亮度是可调节的。 | 近义词: brightness, radiance, brilliance | 反义词: dimness, darkness | 词性: noun

Etymology:
From Late Latin *lūminōsitās, from Latin lūminōsus (“shining, full of light”), from lūmen (“light”), from PIE *leuk- (“light, brightness”).
