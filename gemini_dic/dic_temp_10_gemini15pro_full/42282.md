counter-etch:/ˈkaʊntər ɛtʃ/ |n. & v. |反蚀刻，回蚀; 对抗蚀刻|A process used in lithography and etching, particularly in printed circuit board manufacturing, to slightly etch the entire substrate before applying the resist. This removes any surface oxides or contaminants and promotes better adhesion of the resist, resulting in cleaner lines and preventing undercutting.|

例句：
The counter-etch ensures a clean surface for the photoresist.
反蚀刻确保了光刻胶的清洁表面。

The PCB manufacturer uses a counter-etch process before applying the solder mask.
电路板制造商在涂敷阻焊膜之前使用反蚀刻工艺。


近义词：reverse etch, pre-etch|反义词: N/A (No direct antonym, but the absence of counter-etching would be its opposite in practice)|词性: 名词, 动词
