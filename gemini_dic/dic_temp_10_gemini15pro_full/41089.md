词源:  "Cop" likely originates from the Dutch word "kappen" meaning "to seize, catch, or grab."  It entered English slang in the 18th century, initially meaning "to steal or snatch."  Its meaning later broadened to encompass acquiring things in general, and also to "accept" or "take" something, such as blame or punishment.  The noun form followed from the verb.
