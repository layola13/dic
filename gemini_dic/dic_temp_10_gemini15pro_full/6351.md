amphiaster: /ˈæmfiˌæstər/ | n. | 双星体 | A star-shaped structure formed in a cell during mitosis, consisting of two asters connected by the spindle fibers.  It is involved in chromosome segregation. | The amphiaster plays a crucial role in ensuring that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes. 双星体在确保每个子细胞都获得一套完整的染色体方面起着至关重要的作用。

The amphiaster is visible under a microscope during cell division. 在细胞分裂过程中，可以在显微镜下看到双星体。 | 近义词: mitotic spindle (though not strictly synonymous, it's closely related) | 反义词:  N/A | 词性: noun
