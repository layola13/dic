词源: "Focom" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling of "focus."  "Focus" comes from the Latin word "focus" meaning "hearth, fireplace."  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the central point of heat or light, and then metaphorically to the center of attention or activity.
