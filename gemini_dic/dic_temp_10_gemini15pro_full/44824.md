ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "croissir" (to crack, break), from a Vulgar Latin source related to Latin "cruciare" (to torture, torment, crucify).  The sense of a crowded situation arose from the idea of being pressed or squeezed together. The meaning of "infatuation" is relatively recent, first appearing in the late 19th century.
