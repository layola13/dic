PHRASE-> (This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's more of a descriptive adverb.)


This word is not commonly used in phrases.  Due to its specialized nature, it typically stands alone as an adverb modifying a verb.  Creating forced phrases feels unnatural and contrived.  Therefore, providing examples would be misleading and unhelpful.
