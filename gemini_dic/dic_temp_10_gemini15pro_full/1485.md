ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *acetabulum* (vinegar cup, hip socket) + *-fer* (bearing).  The Latin *acetabulum* itself is derived from *acetum* (vinegar) + *-bulum* (diminutive suffix, indicating a small vessel).

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in zoology and anatomy, to describe anatomical features.  Therefore, providing everyday usage examples across various tenses isn't applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its use within a scientific description:

Researchers observed the *acetabulifera* structures under a microscope. 研究人员在显微镜下观察了髋臼结构。

PHRASE->
This word doesn't commonly appear in phrases outside of technical scientific descriptions.  Therefore, providing five common phrases is not applicable.  Instead, I'll provide examples of how it might be used in a scientific context:

The *acetabulifera* appendages are critical for locomotion. 髋臼附肢对运动至关重要。

The development of the *acetabulifera* structure is a key characteristic of this species.  髋臼结构的发育是该物种的一个关键特征。
