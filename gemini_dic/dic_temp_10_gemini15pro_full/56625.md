注意事项:
词源: Dongola derives its name from the city of Dongola in Sudan, where a specific breed of cattle provided the hides originally used for the leather.  Now, the term often refers to leather made from other animal skins, especially goatskin and sheepskin, that have been treated to mimic the qualities of the original Dongola leather.
