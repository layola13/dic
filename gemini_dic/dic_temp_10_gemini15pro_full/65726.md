PHRASE->
(Eventuate does not commonly form strong collocations with other words. It's often used on its own.  Therefore, rather than forced phrases, here are examples of how it can be used with different prepositions and adverbs):
eventually eventuate in = 最终导致
successfully eventuate = 成功地最终发生
favorably eventuate = 有利地结果
inevitably eventuate = 不可避免地发生
unexpectedly eventuate = 出乎意料地发生


词源：From Latin *eventuatus, past participle of eventuare (“to come out, result, happen”), from eventus (“event, outcome”).


注意事项:

* eventuate 用法相对正式，在日常口语中较少使用。
*  虽然将来进行时和将来完成进行时在语法上是正确的，但它们与 eventuate 的搭配很不常见。
