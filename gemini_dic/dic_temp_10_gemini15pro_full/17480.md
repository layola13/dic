词源:
From Middle English *bereth*, third-person singular present indicative form of *beren*, from Old English *beran* (“to bear, carry, bring forth”), from Proto-Germanic *beraną* (“to bear, carry”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰer- (“to carry, bear”). Cognate with Scots *beir* (“to bear”), West Frisian *beare* (“to bear”), Dutch *baren* (“to bear”), German *gebären* (“to give birth”), Danish *bære* (“to carry, wear”), Swedish *bära* (“to carry, wear”), Icelandic *bera* (“to bear, carry”).

用法说明:
"Beareth" is an archaic form of the verb "bear," specifically the third-person singular present indicative form.  It is rarely used in modern English, except in very formal or literary contexts, particularly those imitating older styles of writing like the King James Bible.  It retains all the meanings of the modern "bears" in this form.
