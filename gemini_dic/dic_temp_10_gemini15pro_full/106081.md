knickerbockerses:/ˈnɪkərˌbɒkəzɪz/
noun
灯笼裤；宽松的及膝裤
plural form of knickerbockers.  Knickerbockers are loose-fitting breeches gathered at the knee.  This plural form is uncommon.
例句：His knickerbockerses were made of a fine linen. 他的灯笼裤是用上好的亚麻布做的。(This sentence is grammatically correct, but sounds unnatural due to the uncommon pluralization.  "His knickerbockers were..." is preferred.)

例句：He had several pairs of knickerbockerses for different occasions.  他有好几条灯笼裤，可以应付不同的场合。(Again, while grammatically correct, "knickerbockers" without the "es" sounds more natural.)

近义词：breeches, pants, trousers
反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "tight pants" or "skinny jeans" in a modern context)
词性: noun (plural)


ETYMOLOGY->
From Dutch *knikkerbokkers, referencing the Dutch settlers of New York, depicted in Washington Irving's "Knickerbocker's History of New York" (1809) as wearing such pants.  The name "Knickerbocker" became associated with New Yorkers, and thus the style of pants.
