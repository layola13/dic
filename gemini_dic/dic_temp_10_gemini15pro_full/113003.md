ETYMOLOGY->

From "lumber" (n.), which comes from Middle English "lombren," meaning "to encumber," from Old French "encombrer," meaning "to obstruct." The original sense referred to the cluttering of a place with discarded objects, eventually becoming associated with the storage of logs and timber. The adjectival form "lumbering" then developed to describe the slow, heavy movement associated with carrying or transporting large pieces of lumber.
