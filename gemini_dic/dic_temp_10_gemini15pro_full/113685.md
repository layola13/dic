PHRASE->
(Since "macki" is a specific animal name, it doesn't typically form common phrases like abstract nouns.  However, here are some examples using the more general term "lemur", which could be applicable to mackis):

See the lemur!  看那只狐猴！
Where is the lemur?  狐猴在哪里？
The lemur is cute. 这只狐猴很可爱。
Did you see the lemur jump? 你看到狐猴跳了吗？
The lemur is native to Madagascar. 狐猴原产于马达加斯加。


词源:  From Malagasy *maki, which might be of Austronesian origin, related to Javanese *maŋki, Sundanese *moŋki. Ultimately imitative.


注意事项: "Macki" is less common than the broader term "lemur".  While technically correct, using "lemur" is usually preferred unless specifically referring to a recognized "macki" subspecies.
