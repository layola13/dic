词源:
"Caustic" comes from the Late Latin "causticus," meaning "burning," from the Greek "kaustikos," from "kaiein," meaning "to burn." "Soda" comes from the Medieval Latin "soda," referring to certain alkali-rich plants.  The term "caustic soda" thus refers to the burning or corrosive nature of this alkali.
