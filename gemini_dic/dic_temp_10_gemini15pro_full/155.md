From Middle English *abasshednes, from abasshed (past participle of abasshen) + -nes.  Ultimately from Old French esbahir ("to astound, amaze").

USAGE->

For example, instead of "The abashedness's of the child...", one would typically say "The child's abashedness..." or "The abashedness of the child...".
