ETYMOLOGY->

From the phrasal verb "give up," composed of the verb "give" (Old English *giefan, from Proto-Germanic *geban, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰ₁ébʰ- "to give, take") and the adverb/preposition "up" (Old English uppe, from Proto-Germanic *upp, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *upo "up, over").  The meaning of "surrender" or "cease trying" developed from the literal sense of "handing something over" or "relinquishing control."
