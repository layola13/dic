condensational:/ˌkɒndɛnˈseɪʃənəl/ (US) /ˌkɑːndɛnˈseɪʃənəl/| adj.|冷凝的；凝结的|Relating to or formed by condensation.|The condensational process is crucial for cloud formation.|近义词：condensing|反义词：evaporative|词性:形容词

Etymology: From "condensation" + "-al". "Condensation" comes from Late Latin "condensātiōn-", from Latin "condēnsāre" meaning "to make dense," from "com-" (together) + "dēnsāre" (to make dense), from "dēnsus" (dense).
