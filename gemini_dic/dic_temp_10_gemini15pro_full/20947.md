ETYMOLOGY->
"Bleeding edge" is a metaphorical extension of "cutting edge."  "Cutting edge" refers to the sharpest part of a blade, implying the most effective or advanced part. "Bleeding edge" takes this further, suggesting that the technology is so new it's still "raw" or untested, and therefore potentially risky or problematic – like a cut that is still bleeding.  The term likely originated in the late 20th century with the rapid advancement of technology.
