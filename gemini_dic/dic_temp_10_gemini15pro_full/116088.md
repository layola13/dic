The word "martyrial" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It is likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  It's possible the intended word is "material" or perhaps related to "martyr."  Since the word isn't recognized, a standard lexical analysis is impossible.  I will provide analyses for both "material" and "martyr" and speculate on a potential meaning for "martyrial" based on these.
