astatine: /ˈæstəˌtiːn/ | n. |砹|A radioactive chemical element; the heaviest of the halogen series.  It occurs naturally as a decay product of uranium and thorium. |Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element on Earth. 砹是地球上最稀有的天然元素。|Synonym:  halogen |Antonym:  None (as it's a specific element) |noun

astatines: /ˈæstəˌtiːnz/ | n. | 砹（复数，一般不用）| Refers to astatine, typically in a context discussing multiple isotopes or instances of the element.  While grammatically correct, it's rarely used due to astatine's rarity and instability. | Scientists are researching the properties of astatines. 科学家们正在研究砹的各种同位素的特性。| Synonym: halogens (in the context of the element group)| Antonym: None | noun
