词源: From Old French *nice "silly, simple, foolish" < Latin nescius "ignorant, unaware," from ne- "not" + scius "knowing," from scire "to know." The semantic shift from "silly" to "coy, shy" to "fastidious, scrupulous" to "delicate, refined" to "pleasant, agreeable" occurred from c. 1300 to the 18th century.
