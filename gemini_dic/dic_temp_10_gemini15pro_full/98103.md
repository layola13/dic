"inrees" is not a recognized English word. It's possible there's a typo or it's a slang/newly coined term not yet in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  However, if you meant "increase," I can offer the following:

increase: /ɪnˈkriːs/ | n. v. | 增加; 增多; 增长; |  A rise in amount, number, or degree. | The company saw an increase in sales this quarter. 公司本季度销售额有所增长。|  rise, growth, expansion | decrease, decline | noun, verb

increase: /ɪnˈkriːs/ | n. v. | 增加; 增多; 增长; | To make or become greater in size, amount, or degree. |  They increased the price of gas. 他们提高了汽油价格。| rise, grow, expand | decrease, decline | noun, verb
