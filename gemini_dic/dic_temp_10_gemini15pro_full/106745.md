PHRASE->
(While "L-glucose" isn't commonly used in phrases in everyday language, here are some examples related to its scientific context)

1. the synthesis of L-glucose (左旋葡萄糖的合成)
2. the properties of L-glucose (左旋葡萄糖的特性)
3. the structure of L-glucose (左旋葡萄糖的结构)
4. the applications of L-glucose (左旋葡萄糖的应用)
5. L-glucose vs. D-glucose (左旋葡萄糖与右旋葡萄糖)


注意事项：Since "L-glucoses" is rarely used and sounds unnatural, I have primarily used "L-glucose" in the examples.  The plural form might be used in a very specific scientific context where multiple distinct forms or batches of L-glucose are being discussed.  However, even then, it is more likely that scientists would refer to specific types or samples, rather than using the general plural.
