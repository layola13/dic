PHRASE->
(As a noun, "bander" in the sense of "robber" is more likely to appear in phrases, but it's not commonly used in modern English.)

The bander held up the stagecoach. = 土匪劫持了驿站马车。

注意事项:
"bander" as a noun meaning "one who bandages" is less common than the verb "to bandage".  It is more common to simply use "the person bandaging". The noun form meaning "robber" is also less common in modern English, with "bandit" or "robber" being preferred.
