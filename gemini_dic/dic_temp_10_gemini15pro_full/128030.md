词源:  The origin is uncertain, but it is believed to have emerged in the late 1950s or early 1960s.  One theory suggests it comes from Dr. Seuss's book "If I Ran the Zoo" (1950), which features a creature called a "nerd."  Another theory links it to the word "nert," slang for a foolish or contemptible person.
