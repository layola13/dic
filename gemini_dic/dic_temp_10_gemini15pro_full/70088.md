词源:  From Old French *fuitrer, from Vulgar Latin *fūctrāre, from Latin fūctāre “to dye, paint, color,” possibly influenced by *fūgitāre “to drive away, put to flight.”  The original meaning related to a falcon's plumage, later developing into the sense of alliance, perhaps through the image of hawks joining together in hunting.
