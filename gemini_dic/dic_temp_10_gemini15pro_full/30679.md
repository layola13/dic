"cers" itself is not a valid English word. It's likely a fragment or a misspelling. However, if you meant "cer" as a root or combining form, it could relate to words containing "cer," like  "certify," "certificate," "certainty," etc.  Since there's no standalone word "cers," I'll analyze "certify" as an example and then address the possible root "cer-".
