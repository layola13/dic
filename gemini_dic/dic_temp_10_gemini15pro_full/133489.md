nonfermentabilities: /ˌnɑːnfɜːrˌmɛntəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 非发酵菌 |  A group of Gram-negative bacteria that are unable to ferment carbohydrates (sugars) as a primary means of energy production. They are often found in hospital settings and can cause infections in immunocompromised individuals. | These nonfermentabilities were isolated from the patient's wound.  这些非发酵菌是从病人的伤口处分离出来的。| synonyms: nonfermenters | antonyms: fermenters | noun
