USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The EOS marker signals the end of the data stream. EOS标记表示数据流的结束。
The system checks for the EOS character after each transmission. 系统在每次传输后检查EOS字符。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is searching for the EOS marker. 程序正在搜索EOS标记。
The system is processing data until it encounters the EOS signal.  系统正在处理数据，直到遇到EOS信号。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The transmission has reached the EOS. 传输已到达EOS。
The file has been processed up to the EOS marker. 文件已处理到EOS标记。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The system has been searching for the EOS for several minutes. 系统已经搜索EOS几分钟了。
The program has been reading the data stream until it finds the EOS. 程序一直在读取数据流，直到找到EOS。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program stopped when it detected the EOS. 程序检测到EOS时停止了。
The system processed the data until the EOS was reached. 系统处理数据直到达到EOS。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The system was processing the file when it encountered the EOS. 系统正在处理文件时遇到了EOS。
The program was searching for the EOS when the error occurred. 程序正在搜索EOS时发生了错误。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had processed the entire file before it reached the EOS. 程序在到达EOS之前已处理了整个文件。
The system had already identified the EOS before the error occurred. 系统在错误发生之前已经识别了EOS。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been searching for the EOS for hours before it finally found it. 程序一直在搜索EOS几个小时才终于找到它。
The system had been processing the data stream for a long time before it reached the EOS. 系统在到达EOS之前已经处理数据流很长时间了。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will stop when it reaches the EOS. 程序到达EOS时将停止。
The system will process the data until it finds the EOS marker. 系统将处理数据，直到找到EOS标记。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The system will be processing the data until it encounters the EOS. 系统将处理数据，直到遇到EOS。
The program will be searching for the EOS marker at the end of the transmission. 程序将在传输结束时搜索EOS标记。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The program will have processed the entire file by the time it reaches the EOS. 程序到达EOS时将已经处理了整个文件。
The system will have identified the EOS before the next data packet arrives. 系统将在下一个数据包到达之前识别EOS。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The system will have been processing the data for several hours by the time it reaches the EOS. 系统到达EOS时将已经处理数据几个小时了。
The program will have been searching for the EOS for a considerable time before it finds it. 程序将在找到EOS之前已经搜索了相当长的时间。
