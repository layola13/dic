gonoblastid: /ˌɡɒnəˈblæstɪd/ | n. | 生殖芽; 芽生殖体 |A reproductive bud or cell, especially in coelenterates and sponges, that develops into a medusa or a sexual individual. |The gonoblastids of the hydra differentiate into either sperm or eggs. 水螅的芽生殖体分化成精子或卵子。| 近义词: reproductive bud, germ cell | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, could consider somatic cell as a contrasting cell type) | 词性: noun

gonoblast: /ˈɡɒnəˌblæst/ | n. | 生殖细胞 |An embryonic cell that will develop into a gamete. |The gonoblasts migrate to the gonads during development. 生殖细胞在发育过程中迁移到性腺。| 近义词: germ cell, gametocyte | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, could consider somatic cell as a contrasting cell type) | 词性: noun


Etymology:  From Greek *gonē* (seed, offspring) + *blastos* (bud, germ)
