Etymology:
From mis- (wrongly) + intend (to have in mind as a purpose).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", "changed, altered" (source also of Old Saxon "miss-", Old Frisian "miss-", Old Norse "mis-", Dutch "mis-", German "miß-", Gothic "missa-"). The verb "intend" comes from Old French "entendre"  and ultimately from Latin "intendere"  "to stretch out, turn one's attention to," from "in-" (toward) + "tendere" (to stretch).
