multiple inflamednesses = 多处炎症 (More natural: multiple inflammations)
severe inflamednesses = 严重的炎症 (More natural: severe inflammation)

注意事项:
The word "inflamednesses" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  "Inflammation" is the preferred and more natural-sounding term.  While grammatically correct, using "inflamednesses" sounds unnatural and is generally avoided.
