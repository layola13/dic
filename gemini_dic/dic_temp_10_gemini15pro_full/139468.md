Etymology:
From Latin *obstetricius*, from *obstetrix* "midwife," from *obstare* "to stand before, stand opposite to, withstand, oppose, obstruct," from *ob* "against, toward" + *stare* "to stand."  The original sense referred to midwives being overly assertive and forward, later generalized to anyone behaving in a similarly intrusive manner.
