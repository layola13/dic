PHRASE->

(This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  Since it's a relatively uncommon adverb, it's more likely to be used descriptively within a sentence rather than as part of a set phrase.)


注意事项:  As "nonvagrantly" is not a common word, examples might feel somewhat contrived. It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "vagrantly," which itself is not frequently used. You're more likely to encounter synonyms like "sedentary" or "settled."
