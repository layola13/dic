USAGE->词源: From Old French *mortifier, from Late Latin mortificāre (“to cause death, kill; macerate, mortify”), from Latin mors (“death”) + -ficāre, combinig form of facere (“to make, do”).  The semantic development followed the pattern of Latin mortificāre, which acquired the figurative sense “to put to death, destroy, subdue” in Late Latin.
