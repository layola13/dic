gynander:/dʒaɪˈnændər/ | n. |雌雄嵌体，雌雄同体|An organism, especially an insect, that displays both male and female characteristics in different parts of its body.  A gynander is a mosaic individual made up of both male and female tissue.| Example: The researchers discovered a rare gynander butterfly, with one wing displaying male patterns and the other female. 研究人员发现了一只罕见的雌雄嵌体蝴蝶，它的一个翅膀显示雄性图案，另一个翅膀显示雌性图案。| Example:  Gynandromorphism is a rare phenomenon, but gynanders have been observed in various species. 雌雄同体是一种罕见的现象，但在各种物种中都观察到了雌雄嵌体。|Synonyms: hermaphrodite (though not strictly accurate as gynandromorphism refers to mosaicism), intersex| Antonyms:  N/A (The opposite would imply a typical sexually dimorphic individual, which isn't a single word.) | noun
