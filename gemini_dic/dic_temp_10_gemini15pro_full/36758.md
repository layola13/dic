colluctancy: /kəˈlʌktənsi/ | n. | 犹豫，不情愿 | Reluctance or unwillingness to do something. |  He showed some colluctancy to accept the offer.  他表现出一些接受这份工作的犹豫。 | 近义词: reluctance, hesitancy, unwillingness | 反义词: eagerness, willingness, readiness | 词性: 名词

词源:  "Colluctancy" is likely a back-formation from "colluctant," which itself seems to be a blend of "reluctant" and perhaps "collect" (in the sense of gathering one's thoughts or composure before acting). However, it's not a standard or widely accepted English word. It's likely a rare or even erroneous formation.  It's recommended to use the established word "reluctance" instead.
