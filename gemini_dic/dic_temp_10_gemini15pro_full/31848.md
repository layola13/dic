Etymology:  "Cheepy" is an informal variant of "cheap," which comes from Old English *cēap "bargain, price, purchase," from Proto-Germanic *kaup- (source also of Old Saxon kop "purchase," Old Frisian kep "trade," Middle Dutch coop "purchase, bargain," Dutch koop "purchase," Old High German kouf "purchase," German Kauf "purchase"), from PIE root *kōu- "to strike, cut."  The sense development from "bargain" to "low in price" occurred in Middle English.  "Cheepy" likely arose as a playful or emphatic form of "cheap," adding the "-y" suffix which often suggests a diminutive or informal quality.
