cocatalyst:/kəʊˈkætəlɪst/ | n. | 助催化剂；促进剂 | A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change, but which enhances the activity of a catalyst. |  The reaction was significantly faster in the presence of the cocatalyst.  这个反应在助催化剂存在的情况下明显更快。| Synonyms: promoter, activator | Antonyms: inhibitor, poison | noun

Etymology: From co- + catalyst.  "Co-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "jointly." "Catalyst" comes from the Greek "katalyein," meaning "to dissolve."
