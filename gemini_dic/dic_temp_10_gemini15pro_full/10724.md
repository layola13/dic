apsidally:/æpˈsaɪdəli/
|adv.|拱点地；远地点地；近地点地|At the apsides of an orbit, a body is apsidally farthest or nearest to its primary.|例句：The satellite's speed varies apsidally, being fastest at periapsis and slowest at apoapsis. 卫星的速度拱点地变化，在近拱点最快，在远拱点最慢。

例句：The gravitational force acts most strongly apsidally, either pulling the body inwards at periapsis or slowing its outward motion at apoapsis.  引力在拱点处作用最强，在近拱点将物体向内拉，或在远拱点减缓其向外的运动。|近义词：periapsidally, apoapsidally|反义词: N/A|词性: adverb
词源: From "apsis" + "-al" + "-ly".  "Apsis" comes from the Greek "hapsis" meaning "loop" or "arch".
