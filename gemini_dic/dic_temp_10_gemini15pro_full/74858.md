Etymology: From "frequent" (adj.) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality). "Frequent" comes from Old French "frequent" and directly from Latin "frequentem" (present participle of "frequentare" meaning "to visit often, resort to, crowd, frequent"), from "frequens" meaning "crowded, numerous, repeated, frequent."
