lamarckian:/lɑːˈmɑːrkiən/
adjective
拉马克的；用进废退的
Relating to the theory of evolution developed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, which proposed that acquired characteristics during an organism's lifetime could be inherited by its offspring.
His theory of evolution was largely Lamarckian, based on the idea of the inheritance of acquired traits. 他的进化论很大程度上是拉马克主义的，基于后天获得性状的遗传的观点。
Lamarckian inheritance is no longer considered a valid mechanism of evolution. 拉马克遗传不再被认为是有效的进化机制。

近义词:Darwinian, evolutionary
