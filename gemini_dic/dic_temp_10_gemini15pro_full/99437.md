The word "interess" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a truncated or misspelled form of the German word "interessant," which means "interesting." Therefore, I will analyze "interessant" instead.

interessant: /ɪntəʀɛˈsant/ (German pronunciation) | adj. | 有趣的，引人入胜的 | Interesting, engaging, captivating; holding one's attention. |  Das Buch ist sehr interessant. (The book is very interesting.) |  fascinating, engaging, captivating, intriguing, stimulating | boring, dull, tedious, monotonous | adjective
