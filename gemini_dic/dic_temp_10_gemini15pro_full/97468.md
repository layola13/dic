The word "ingena" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

If you could provide more context, such as the language it's from or the situation where you encountered it, I might be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt requests examples of grammatical usage for the word "what," I can provide that information.
