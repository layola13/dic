ethylenically:/ˌeθɪˈlɛnɪkli/
adverb
以乙烯方式地；通过乙烯键合
In a manner characterized by the presence or action of ethylene or an ethylene derivative; by means of an ethylene bond.
The two monomers are ethylenically linked. 这两个单体以乙烯方式连接。
近义词: unsaturatedly (不饱和地)
反义词: saturatedly (饱和地)
词性: adverb (副词)

ethylenically:/ˌeθɪˈlɛnɪkli/
词源:  From ethylene + -ic + -ally.  "Ethylene" itself comes from ethyl + -ene. "Ethyl" derives from ether + -yl, and ultimately from Greek *aithēr (upper air) + hyle (wood, matter). "-ene" signifies a double bond, while "-ic" forms adjectives, and "-ally" creates adverbs.  Thus, "ethylenically" literally describes a process or characteristic relating to ethylene, specifically its double bond nature.
中文翻译: 以乙烯方式地；通过乙烯键合
英文解析: In a manner relating to or involving ethylene, particularly its double bond characteristic.  This often refers to reactions or properties associated with the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene and its derivatives.
例句:
The polymer is formed by ethylenically polymerizing the monomer.  这种聚合物是通过乙烯聚合单体形成的。

The molecules are ethylenically unsaturated. 这些分子是乙烯基不饱和的。


近义词:  unsaturatedly
反义词: saturatedly
词性: adverb
