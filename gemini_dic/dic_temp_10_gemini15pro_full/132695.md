nondissipatednesses:/ˌnɒndɪˈsɪpeɪtɪdnɪsɪz/ | n. | 非消散性；未耗散状态 | The nondissipatednesses of the energy in the system allowed for its continued operation.  系统中能量的非消散性使其能够继续运行。|  The scientist studied the nondissipatednesses of certain materials at low temperatures. 科学家研究了某些材料在低温下的非消散性。 |  conservation, preservation | dissipation, dispersion | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + dissipated + -ness.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not." "Dissipated" comes from the Latin word "dissipare," meaning "to scatter."  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives.
