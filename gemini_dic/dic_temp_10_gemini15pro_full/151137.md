paratectonic:/ˌpærətɛkˈtɒnɪk/ | adj. | 副构造的，伴随构造作用的 | Relating to geological processes that are closely associated with, but not directly caused by, tectonic activity.  Specifically, refers to processes related to the stresses and strains of tectonic movements, but occurring at a smaller scale or in a more localized way than the major tectonic deformations. | The paratectonic fracturing observed in the region is believed to be related to the uplift of the mountain range. 该地区观察到的副构造断裂被认为与山脉的隆起有关。

The researchers studied the paratectonic folds and faults in the sedimentary rocks. 研究人员研究了沉积岩中的副构造褶皱和断层。 | 近义词: secondary tectonic, associated tectonic | 反义词: primary tectonic | 词性: adjective
