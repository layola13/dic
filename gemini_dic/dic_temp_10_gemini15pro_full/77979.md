词源： From Old French gentil "noble, high-born," from Latin gentilis "of the same clan or family," from gens "clan, race, nation, people." The religious sense developed from the Vulgate (Latin translation of the Bible) use of gentiles to translate Greek ta ethne "the nations," referring to non-Jewish peoples.
