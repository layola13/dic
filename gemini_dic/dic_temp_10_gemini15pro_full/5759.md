PHRASE->
(Amain is typically used on its own and doesn't form common phrases. It's more of a literary or archaic term. Therefore, providing phrases becomes difficult and might involve forcing unnatural combinations. Instead of phrases, I've focused on showcasing diverse usage through various tenses and sentence structures.)

注意事项:  Amain is considered archaic or literary and is not commonly used in modern English.  More common synonyms are generally preferred.
