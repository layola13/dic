词源:  "Crowtoe" likely gets its name from the resemblance of the seed pods to a crow's foot.  "Trefoil" refers to the three-lobed leaves.  The scientific name, *Lotus corniculatus*,  comes from the Greek *lotos* for a type of clover and Latin *corniculatus* meaning "having little horns," referring to the shape of the seed pods.
