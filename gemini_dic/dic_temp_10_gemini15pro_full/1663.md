ETYMOLOGY->
From a- (meaning "without" or "not") + clinic (from Greek klinein "to lean, slope").  Thus, "without slope".

Attributive position (modifying a noun):
The aclinic line marks the points where the magnetic dip is zero. = 无倾线标志着磁倾角为零的点。
They conducted research in the aclinic zone. = 他们在无倾角区进行了研究。


Predicative position (following a linking verb):

Prepositional phrase:
The compass needle remained horizontal, indicating an aclinic field. = 指南针保持水平，表明这是一个无倾角场。
The measurements were taken along the aclinic line. = 测量是沿着无倾线进行的。



PHRASE->
aclinic line = 无倾线
aclinic zone = 无倾角区
aclinic magnetic field = 无倾角磁场
point of aclinic dip = 无倾角点
aclinic condition = 无倾角状态
