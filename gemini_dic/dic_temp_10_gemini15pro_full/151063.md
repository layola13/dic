paraphysis:/pəˈræfɪsɪs/
n.
侧丝，副枝
A sterile, hairlike filament or other appendage occurring among the reproductive organs of certain fungi, algae, mosses, and ferns.
Example: The paraphyses among the asci help to disperse the spores.  侧丝在子囊中帮助孢子散播。

Example:  The function of paraphyses in moss reproduction is still being studied. 苔藓繁殖中侧丝的功能仍在研究中。


Synonym: filament, appendage
Antonym:  (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical structure)
词性: noun
