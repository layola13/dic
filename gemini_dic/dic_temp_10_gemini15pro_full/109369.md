lensers:/ˈlɛnzərz/ | n. |透镜效应；透镜状星系；引力透镜效应|The phenomenon of light bending around a massive object, creating a distorted image of a more distant object behind it.  This effect is often used to observe very distant galaxies. |Example 1: Astronomers use the effect of lensers to study the early universe. 天文学家利用透镜效应来研究早期宇宙。

Example 2: The Hubble Space Telescope has captured stunning images of lensers. 哈勃太空望远镜捕捉到了令人惊叹的透镜效应图像。| 近义词: gravitational lenses, cosmic lenses | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but the absence of the effect could be considered) | 词性: noun (plural)

词源:  Derived from "lens" + "-er" (agent suffix indicating something that performs the action of lensing).  "Lens" itself comes from the Latin "lens" meaning "lentil," due to the similarity in shape.
