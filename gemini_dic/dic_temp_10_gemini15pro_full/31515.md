注意事项:

*  "Charre"  is a less common variant of "chore."  While understood, "chore" is the standard and preferred spelling.  Therefore, all examples and explanations are provided using  "charre" as requested, but  using "chore" is recommended.
* The provided antonym "leisure" represents the opposite concept, but a direct antonym for a mundane task doesn't truly exist.
