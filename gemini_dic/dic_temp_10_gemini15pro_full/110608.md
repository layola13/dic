limonite:/ˈlaɪməˌnaɪt/ /ˈlɪməˌnaɪt/ | n. |褐铁矿|A common iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron oxides, often amorphous. Limonite is not a distinct mineral but rather a general term for this mixture, which can include various iron oxide-hydroxide minerals like goethite, lepidocrocite, and others. It typically appears as earthy brown masses or concretions and is a significant source of iron. | Miners extracted limonite from the quarry. 矿工们从采石场提取褐铁矿。|
|近义词:goethite, bog iron ore|反义词: (No direct antonym for a specific mineral, could consider minerals without iron content like quartz or feldspar depending on the context) |noun|
