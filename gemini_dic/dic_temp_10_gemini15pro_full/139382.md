observability:/əbˌzɜːrvəˈbɪləti/ |n.|可观测性|The ability to infer internal states of a system from knowledge of its external outputs.  The more observable a system is, the more easily its internal state can be understood and controlled.|The system's observability allows engineers to quickly diagnose and fix problems.| 近义词:monitorability, traceability|反义词: opacity, inscrutability|词性:名词

词源: From "observable" + "-ity". "Observable" comes from the Late Middle English "observable," from the Old French "observable," from the Latin "observabilis," from "observare" (to observe).
