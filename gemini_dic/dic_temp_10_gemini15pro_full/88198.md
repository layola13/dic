The word "himna" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (like the language it's from), I can help analyze it.

Assuming you meant "hymn," here's the analysis:

hymn: /hɪm/
n.|赞美诗，圣歌|A religious song or poem of praise to God or a god.|They sang a hymn of praise. 他们唱了一首赞美诗。|近义词: psalm, anthem, carol|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "blasphemy" in a contrasting context)|词性: noun
