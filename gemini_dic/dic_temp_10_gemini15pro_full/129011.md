USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Nisam doktor. (I am not a doctor.)
Nisam srećan. (I am not happy.)

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Nisam sada kući. (I am not home now - literally, I am not now at home)  Note:  Serbo-Croatian doesn't directly translate continuous tenses in the same way English does. The present tense often conveys the meaning.
Nisam sada u školi. (I am not at school now - literally, I am not now in school)

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Nisam to uradio. (I haven't done that.) / Nisam to učinio. (I have not done that - more formal)
Nisam je video. (I haven't seen her.)

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
This tense is rarely directly translated. The present perfect or imperfect would likely be used to convey a similar meaning.

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Nisam bio tamo. (I wasn't there.)

一般将来时 (Simple Future):

Neću to uraditi. (I will not do that.)

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
This tense is rarely directly translated. The future tense would likely be used.
