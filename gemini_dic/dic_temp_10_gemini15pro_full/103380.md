词源:  "Jingo" originated as a word in a popular British music hall song of 1878, expressing a bellicose attitude toward Russia during a diplomatic crisis. The song's refrain was "By Jingo, we don't want to fight, but, by Jingo, if we do..."  Although the origin of "Jingo" in the song is obscure, it may have been a euphemism for "Jesus".
