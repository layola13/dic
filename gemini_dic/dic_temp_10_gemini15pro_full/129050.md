nitrification:/ˌnaɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. |硝化作用| The process by which ammonia is converted to nitrites and then to nitrates by bacteria in the soil. | Nitrification is an important process in the nitrogen cycle. 硝化作用是氮循环中的一个重要过程。|  Nitrification plays a crucial role in making nitrogen available to plants. 硝化作用在使氮素对植物有效方面起着至关重要的作用。| 近义词:nitrogen fixation (somewhat) | 反义词:denitrification | 词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From *nitrify* + *-fication*. *Nitrify* comes from French *nitrifier*, from *nitre* (niter, saltpeter) + *-fier* (from Latin *-ficāre*, to make). Ultimately from Latin *nitrum* and Greek *nítron* (natron), referring to naturally occurring sodium carbonate.
