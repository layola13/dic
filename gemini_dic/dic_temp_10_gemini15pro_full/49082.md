PHRASE->
(Dehyphen does not commonly form set phrases.  It is generally used directly with words relating to text, such as "word," "text," "document," "title," etc.)


de-hyphen vs. unhyphenate: While both mean to remove a hyphen, "dehyphen" emphasizes the *act* of removing the hyphen, while "unhyphenate" focuses on the *result* of no longer having a hyphen.  The difference is subtle.
