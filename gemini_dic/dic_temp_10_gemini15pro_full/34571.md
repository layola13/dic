From "cleared" + "-ness."  "Cleared" comes from the verb "clear," which has its roots in the Old French word "cler" (meaning "bright, clear") and ultimately from the Latin "clarus" (meaning "clear, bright, renowned").  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
