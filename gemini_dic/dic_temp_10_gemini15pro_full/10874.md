ETYMOLOGY->
From New Latin *arachnidēs (plural), from Latin arāchnē (“spider”), from Ancient Greek ἀράχνη (arákhnē, “spider”), perhaps from Proto-Hellenic *arákʰnā, from Proto-Indo-European *h₂er- (“to fit together”).  The Greek word is related to the myth of Arachne, a weaver who was transformed into a spider by Athena.
