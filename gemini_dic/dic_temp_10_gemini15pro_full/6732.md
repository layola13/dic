注意事项:  Although "analysation" is grammatically correct, "analysis" is the more commonly used and preferred term.  All examples above could and should use "analysis" instead of "analysation".  It's important to understand that while dictionaries might list "analysation", its usage is exceedingly rare.  Using "analysis" will generally be the better choice.
