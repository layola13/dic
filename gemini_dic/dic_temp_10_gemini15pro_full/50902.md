Etymology: From desert + -ness.  "desert" comes from Old French "desert" (modern French désert), from Latin "desertum" "abandoned place," past participle of "deserere" "to abandon," from "de-" "away" + "serere" "to join, link, bind." "-ness" is a native English suffix forming nouns from adjectives, meaning "state or quality of being."
