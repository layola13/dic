The word "ingelable" is not a recognized English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant a similar-sounding word or had a different word in mind, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist.


If you're curious about word formation and are perhaps trying to create a new word with "ingelable,"  the "-able" suffix typically denotes the ability to be acted upon in the way the root word suggests.  So, if you had a root word "inge" (which isn't a recognized English root), "ingelable" might theoretically mean "able to be inged."  But without a meaning for "inge," this remains speculative.  Please clarify the intended word for a complete analysis.
