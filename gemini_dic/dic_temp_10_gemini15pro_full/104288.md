Etymology:
"Justicoat" is a neologism, a newly coined word.  It's a portmanteau, combining "justice" and "coat."  "Justice" derives from Old French "justice" and ultimately from Latin "iustitia," meaning "righteousness, equity." "Coat" comes from Old French "cote" and ultimately from Late Latin "cotta."
