muggish:/ˈmʌɡɪʃ/| adj.|闷热的；潮湿的；迟钝的|Characterized by oppressive heat and humidity; also, dull and sluggish, lacking in energy or alertness.|The muggy weather made everyone feel sluggish. 闷热的天气让每个人都感到迟钝。|近义词：humid, sultry, sticky, close, oppressive, dull, sluggish, listless, lethargic|反义词：fresh, invigorating, energetic, lively|词性:形容词

词源: From mug + -ish.  "Mug," in dialectal English, referred to drizzling rain or mist, hence "muggish" originally meant misty or damp. The sense of "close and humid" developed from this, and the meaning of "dull and sluggish" is likely a figurative extension of the feeling of oppression and inertia brought on by muggy weather.
