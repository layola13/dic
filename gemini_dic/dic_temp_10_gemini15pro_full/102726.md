janha is not a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, a slang term, or a proper noun.  I can't analyze it as an English word.  If you can provide more context, like the language it comes from or the sentence you saw it in, I might be able to help.

If you meant "what," here is an analysis:

what: /wɑːt/ (US) /wɒt/ (UK) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | What color is the sky? 天空是什么颜色的？ | similar: which, how | opposite: (No direct opposite for "what") | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection
