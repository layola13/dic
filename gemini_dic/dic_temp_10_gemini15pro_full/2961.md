ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *adytum*, from Ancient Greek *ἄδυτον (áduton)*, neuter of *ἄδυτος (ádutos)* meaning "not to be entered," from *ἀ- (a-)*  "not" + *δῦναι (dûnai)*, aorist infinitive of *δύω (dúō)*, "to enter," "to go into," "to put on," related to *δυ-, δύο (du-, dúo)*, "two."  The sense evolution suggests a place so sacred that it was essentially "not to be entered" by the uninitiated.
