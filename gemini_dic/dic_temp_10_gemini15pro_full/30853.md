注意事项:

“Chade”是一个相对较新的俚语，其含义和用法可能仍在不断演变。  它主要用于网络社区，在正式场合使用时需要注意。 这个词也可能带有负面含义，暗示肤浅和以自我为中心。


词源：  "Chade" is believed to be derived from the incel (involuntarily celibate) online community, used ironically to refer to men they perceive as sexually successful.  It gained further popularity through online forums and social media.
