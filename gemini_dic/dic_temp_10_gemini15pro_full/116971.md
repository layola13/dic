mbr:/ˈɛm biː ɑːr/ | abbreviation | 主引导记录 (Master Boot Record) |  The MBR is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond.  It holds information on how the logical partitions, containing file systems, are organized on that medium. The MBR also contains executable code to function as a loader for the installed operating system—usually by passing control over to the loader's second stage or in conjunction with a partition boot sector. | The MBR was damaged and the computer wouldn't boot. 主引导记录损坏了，电脑无法启动。 | synonyms: boot sector, boot record | antonyms: N/A | noun

注意事项:  由于mbr是一个缩写，没有反义词，且近义词也相对局限于其技术含义，所以此处只列出了boot sector 和 boot record。 虽然mbr本身不是一个完整的单词，但在技术语境中，它通常被当作名词使用，因此词性标注为名词。
