词源: From Middle English *bitaken, from Old English *betācan (“to commit, entrust, deliver, assign, betaken”), from be- + tācan (“to teach, show”). Cognate with Dutch betaken (“to betake”), German beistehen (“to assist”).


注意事项:  Betaking is an archaic word and rarely used in modern English.  It is more likely to be encountered in older literature.  While grammatically correct in all tenses, its usage in future tenses sounds particularly unnatural.  It is usually followed by the reflexive pronoun "oneself" and the preposition "to".
