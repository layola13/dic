deme:/diːm/ | n. | 地方群体；同类群 | A local population of organisms of one species that actively interbreed with one another and share a distinct gene pool. | Example 1: The deme of frogs in this pond has unique markings.  这个池塘里的青蛙地方群体有独特的标记。

Example 2:  Researchers studied the genetic diversity within the isolated deme. 研究人员研究了这个孤立的同类群内的遗传多样性。 |  Synonym: population, subpopulation, community | Antonym:  N/A (Deme doesn't have a direct antonym; perhaps a broader, more diverse population could be considered conceptually opposite) | noun
