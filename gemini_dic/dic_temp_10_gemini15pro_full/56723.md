ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *dorcas*, from Old English *dorcearu* ("door-frame, door-post"), equivalent to *duru* ("door") + *cearu* ("care, anxiety, trouble").  The second element likely refers to the careful construction required for a doorframe.  The meaning shifted to encompass the entire frame and later the decorative molding around it.
