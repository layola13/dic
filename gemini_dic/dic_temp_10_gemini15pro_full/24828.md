词源：
The term "brown-bag" originates from the common practice of carrying one's lunch in a brown paper bag.  This practice became especially prevalent during the Great Depression in the United States as a way to save money.  Over time, the term "brown-bag" became associated with bringing one's own food or drink, regardless of the container used.  The term has also been extended to include bringing one's own alcoholic beverages to an event, sometimes referred to as "brown-bagging it."
