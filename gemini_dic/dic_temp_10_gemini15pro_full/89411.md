homothally:/ˌhɒməˈθæli/
adjective
同宗配合的；自體受精的
The ability of a fungus to reproduce sexually by the fusion of nuclei from the same mycelium.  A fungus that is homothallic does not require a partner of a different mating type to reproduce sexually.
Homothallism is observed in many fungi, allowing them to self-fertilize. 许多真菌都观察到同宗配合现象，这使得它们能够自交。
Some fungi exhibit homothallism, while others are heterothallic. 一些真菌表现出同宗配合，而另一些是异宗配合的。
近义词:self-fertile, self-compatible
反义词:heterothallic
词性:adjective
