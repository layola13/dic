From Late Latin *immoderantia, from immoderant- (stem of immoderans) lacking moderation + -ia -y.  Immoderant- is from in- not + moderant- (stem of moderans) moderating. Moderans is the present participle of moderari to moderate, from moderatus moderate (past participle of moderare to moderate), from modus measure.
