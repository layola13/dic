meridian: /məˈrɪdiən/ | n. | 子午线，经线，顶点，全盛期 | A circle of longitude passing through the poles, or the half of such a circle from pole to pole; the highest point or stage of development; culmination. |  The prime meridian passes through Greenwich. 本初子午线穿过格林威治。|  He was at the meridian of his life. 他正处于人生的巅峰时期。| 近义词：apex, peak, zenith, culmination | 反义词：nadir, bottom | 词性: 名词

Etymology: From Late Latin *merīdiōnālis*, from Latin merīdiānus (“of or belonging to midday”), from merīdiēs (“midday”), from medius (“middle”) + diēs (“day”).  最终源于原始印欧语 *dyeu- (“to shine; sky, heaven”).
