ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *kakdaw*, equivalent to *kak* "jack" + *daw*.  The element *jack* is often added to bird names to indicate small size or youth. The word "daw" itself comes from Old English *dawe*, related to Old Norse *dökkvi*, ultimately from a Proto-Germanic word imitative of the bird's cry.
