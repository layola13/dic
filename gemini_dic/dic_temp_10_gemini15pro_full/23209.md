Etymology->
From Middle English *bouren, *boweren (“to lodge, dwell”), from Old English būr (“dwelling, chamber, inner room, bower”), from Proto-Germanic *būram (“dwelling”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰew- (“to exist, live, dwell”). Cognate with Scots bour (“bower, chamber, inner room”), West Frisian boer (“chamber, room”), Dutch boer (“farmer, peasant”), German Bauer (“farmer, peasant”), Swedish bur (“cage”), Icelandic búr (“pantry, larder”).  More at bower.  The verbal sense of "bowering" has largely fallen out of use, with the adjectival form becoming more common.
