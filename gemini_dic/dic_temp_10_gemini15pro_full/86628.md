heliums:/ˈhiːliəmz/| n. |氦气（复数，不常用）|Helium is a chemical element with the symbol He and atomic number 2.  It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.  While "heliums" is grammatically correct as the plural of helium, it is rarely used because helium is typically treated as a mass noun.  One would usually refer to "quantities of helium" or "different isotopes of helium" rather than "heliums". |The lab needed large quantities of helium for the experiment.  实验室需要大量的氦气进行实验。| synonym: (Generally uses mass noun, no true synonym for plural form) | antonym: (Not applicable for elements) | noun
