non-stoichiometric:/ˌnɒn stɒɪkiːəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 非化学计量的 |  Describing a compound whose elemental composition cannot be represented by a ratio of small whole numbers.  It often occurs in solid-state compounds, especially oxides and sulfides of transition metals, where variability in the oxidation state of the metal can lead to a range of compositions. | Many transition metal oxides are non-stoichiometric. 许多过渡金属氧化物是非化学计量的。|non-stoichiometric materials, non-daltonian | stoichiometric | adjective
non-stoichiometry:/ˌnɒn stɔɪkiːˈɑːmɪtri/ | n. | 非化学计量性 | The deviation from a simple stoichiometric ratio in a chemical compound. |  The non-stoichiometry of the material affects its electrical properties.  该材料的非化学计量性会影响其电性能。| deviation from stoichiometry | stoichiometry | noun
