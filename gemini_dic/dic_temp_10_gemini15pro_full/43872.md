ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *creuset "crucible, earthen pot" (source also of Modern French creuset), diminutive of Old North French *cruis "pot, jug" (source also of Anglo-Norman crusel), from Late Latin *crucibulum "earthen pot," alteration of Latin crucibulum "earthen pot, melting pot," of uncertain origin. The semantic shift from "pot" to "beacon" likely occurred because cressets were often made from metal pots or similar vessels.
