feriation:  (This word is not a standard English word.)

This word likely stems from a blend of "ferry" and "vacation," suggesting a vacation involving ferry travel, or perhaps a relaxed, leisurely feeling associated with ferry trips.  However, it's not recognized by major dictionaries and is likely a neologism or informal term.  If encountered, its meaning would need to be inferred from context.
