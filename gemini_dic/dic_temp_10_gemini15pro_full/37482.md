词源：
From Late Latin *committere, frequentative of Latin committere "to join together, combine, connect, unite; to begin, commence; to entrust, commit," from com- "together" (see com-) + mittere "to send, let go" (from PIE root *meth- "to put, place").  The original sense was "to join battle," hence "to perpetrate, do (something wrong or reprehensible)."  The meaning "to entrust, confide" emerged in the 14th century.  The sense of "to pledge or bind oneself" appeared in the late 16th century.
