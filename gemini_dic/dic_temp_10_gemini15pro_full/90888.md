PHRASE->
(Generally, "huns" doesn't have common phrases in the way other words do.  Its derogatory use is most common in British slang, and even then, it's usually standalone.)

注意事项:  The derogatory use of "huns" to refer to women perceived as aggressive or unpleasant is considered offensive and should be avoided.
