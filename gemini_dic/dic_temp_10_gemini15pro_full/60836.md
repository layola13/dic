electrostatics:/ɪˌlɛktroʊˈstætɪks/| n.|静电学|The study of stationary electric charges or fields as opposed to electric currents.|Electrostatics plays a crucial role in the design of electronic devices. 静电学在电子设备的设计中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词:static electricity|反义词:electrodynamics|词性:noun

electrostatics:/ɪˌlɛktroʊˈstætɪks/| n.|静电|Static electricity.|The buildup of electrostatics can damage sensitive electronic components.  静电的积累会损坏敏感的电子元件。|近义词:static electricity|反义词:electrodynamics|词性:noun


Etymology:  From electro- + static + -ics. "Electro-" comes from the Greek word "elektron" meaning "amber" (because amber was used in early experiments with static electricity), and "static" comes from the Greek word "statikos" meaning "causing to stand." "-ics" denotes a field of study.
