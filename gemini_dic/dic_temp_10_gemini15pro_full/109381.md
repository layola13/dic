ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *lencten "spring," literally "long," referring to the lengthening days, from Proto-Germanic *langitinaz (source also of Old Saxon lengitho "length," Old Frisian lengtene "spring," Middle Dutch lente, Dutch lente, Old High German lenzo, German Lenz "spring"), from PIE root *dlongho- "long." The religious sense emerged from the association of spring with the period of fasting preceding Easter.
