PHRASE->
(Due to the formal and somewhat archaic nature of "indicavit," it doesn't readily form common phrases.  It's primarily used in formal writing or technical contexts.  Therefore, providing common phrases isn't truly applicable.  Instead, I'm providing examples of how it might be used in a sentence fragment within a larger context.)

1. "...as the data indicavit..." (...正如数据所示...)
2. "...clearly indicavit the presence of..." (...清楚地表明了...的存在)
3.  "...as the results indicavit..." (...正如结果所示...)
4.  "...further indicavit the need for..." (...进一步表明了...的需要)
5.  "...indicavit a significant change in..." (...表明...发生了重大变化)


注意事项:
Although "indicavit" is grammatically correct, it's extremely rare in modern English.  "Indicated" is the standard and preferred form.  Using "indicavit" would sound very formal and possibly archaic.
