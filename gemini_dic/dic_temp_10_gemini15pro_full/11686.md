ETYMOLOGY->
From armour + plated, past participle of plate (v.).  "Armour" comes from Old French "armure," ultimately from Latin "arma" (arms, weapons). "Plate" comes from Old French "plate," ultimately from Late Latin "platēa" (broad street).  The earliest uses refer to literal armour plating on ships and vehicles. The figurative sense of being emotionally or intellectually shielded developed later.
