ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *`dwei`, *`whei`, from Old English `hwā`, `hwæt`, ultimately from Proto-Germanic `*hwaz`, from Proto-Indo-European `*kʷos`, `*kʷis`.  Cognate with Dutch `wie` (“who”), German `wer` (“who”), Latin `quis` (“who”).  The shift from /hw/ to /dw/ and then /d/ is a feature of some dialects, and the spelling "dui" reflects this pronunciation. This pronunciation and spelling are non-standard and considered dialectal or a mispronunciation.
