biophor:/ˈbaɪəfɔːr/| n. |生物载体，生物活体|A hypothetical vital unit or principle of heredity, supposed by Weismann to be transmitted from generation to generation and to control the development of the organism.|  No contemporary scientific literature uses the term "biophor" in this original sense; it is a largely obsolete concept.| 近义词: germ plasm, idioplasm | 反义词: N/A | noun

(Due to the obsolete nature of the word "biophor", common phrases are not readily available.  The following examples are contrived for illustrative purposes and are not likely to be encountered in actual usage.)

Weismann's theory of the biophor was influential. = 魏斯曼的生物载体理论很有影响力。
The concept of the biophor is now considered outdated. = 生物载体的概念现在被认为是过时的。
Scientists debated the nature of the biophor. = 科学家们争论生物载体的本质。
The biophor was a hypothetical unit of heredity. = 生物载体是一个假设的遗传单位。
