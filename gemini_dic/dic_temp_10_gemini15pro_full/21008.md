Etymology:
From the verb "bless" + "-er" (agent suffix).  "Bless" comes from Old English "blēdsian" meaning "to consecrate with blood, mark with blood," related to "blōd" meaning "blood."  The meaning evolved to "to hallow, consecrate," then to "invoke divine favor upon," and finally to "confer prosperity or happiness upon."
