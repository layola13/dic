PHRASE->
none (Bromide is not typically used in set phrases.  It functions mostly as a standalone noun.)

词源: From Greek *βρῶμος* (brōmos, “stench”) + *-ide*.  Originally referring to the strong smell of some bromine compounds, later extended to the sedative effect of some bromides, and finally figuratively to any trite and unoriginal remark.
