词源:  From Middle English *morther, from Old English morþor (“murder, mortal sin, torment, violent death”), from Proto-Germanic *murþrą (“murder, death”). Cognate with Old Frisian morther (“murder”), Old Saxon mordor, morthor (“murder”), Old High German mord (“murder”), Old Norse morð (“murder, manslaughter”), Gothic 𐌼𐌰𐌿𐍂𐌸𐍂 (maurþr, “murder”). Related to Old English myrþrian (“to murder”).

注意事项: 虽然murther和murder拼写不同，但在现代英语中，murder是更常见的拼写。Murther通常被认为是古体或方言用法，在文学作品中更常见，尤其是在营造古旧氛围或模仿古英语的语境下。在非正式语境中，murther可以用来指非常困难或令人不愉快的事情，语气较为夸张。
