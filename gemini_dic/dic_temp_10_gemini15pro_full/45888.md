ETYMOLOGY->

"cute" originated from "acute," meaning sharp or clever, shortened to "cute" in the 18th century.  It gradually shifted to mean attractively pretty or dainty, then to its modern meaning of charmingly childlike or sweet.  "-ness" is a common suffix forming nouns of quality or state. "-sy" is a suffix forming adjectives often implying excessive or affected quality.  Thus, "cutesy" suggests an affected or excessive cuteness, while "cutesynesses" is the plural noun form of this quality.
