ETYMOLOGY->
From good-tempered + -ness.  "good-tempered" arises from "good" (Old English "gōd") and "tempered" (past participle of "temper," from Old French "temprer," ultimately from Latin "temperare," meaning "to mix, blend, moderate"). The suffix "-ness" (Old English "-nes(s)") forms nouns denoting state, quality, or condition.
