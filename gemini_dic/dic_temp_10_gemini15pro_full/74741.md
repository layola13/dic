Etymology:
free + thinker

free (adj.): From Old English *frēo "free, exempt, not in bondage, acting of one's own will," from Proto-Germanic *frijaz (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian fri, Old High German vri, German frei, Dutch vrij, Gothic freis), from PIE root *prijos "dear, beloved," also "free." The semantic shift from "beloved" to "free" likely occurred through the notion of "belonging to one's own kin group" and thus being "free."

thinker (n.): From the verb think + -er (agent suffix). think (v.): From Old English þencan "to conceive in the mind, consider, imagine, intend," from Proto-Germanic *thankijan "to think, seem" (source also of Old Saxon thenkian, Old Frisian thinka, Old High German thenken, German denken, Old Norse þekkja "to seem, appear," Gothic thankjan "to think").
