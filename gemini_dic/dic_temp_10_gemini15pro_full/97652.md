The word "inherse" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling of "inherent" or perhaps a confusion with "inverse."  I will provide information for both "inherent" and "inverse."


**Inherent:**

/ɪnˈhɪərənt/ | adj. | 固有的，内在的 | Existing as a natural or basic part of something. |例句：There are dangers inherent in almost every sport. 几乎每项运动都存在内在的危险。|例句：The inherent instability of the aircraft caused concern. 飞机固有的不稳定性令人担忧。|近义词：intrinsic, innate, essential |反义词: extrinsic, acquired |词性: adjective


**Inverse:**

/ɪnˈvɜːrs/ | adj. n. | 相反的，倒数的；相反，倒数 | Opposite in nature or effect; something reversed in position, order, or relation. |例句：Poverty and poor health often have an inverse relationship. 贫困和健康状况不佳通常呈反比关系。|例句：Multiplication is the inverse of division. 乘法是除法的逆运算。|近义词：reverse, opposite, contrary |反义词: direct, same |词性: adjective, noun
