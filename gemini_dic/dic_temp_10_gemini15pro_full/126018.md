musrol:  Not found in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a technical term specific to a certain field, a proper noun (name of a person, place or thing), or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a technical term, knowing the field it belongs to would be helpful.  If it's a misspelling, what word did you intend to look up?
