commutability:/kəˌmjuːtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可交换性；可对易性 | The property of operations or elements that allows their order to be interchanged without affecting the outcome. |  Matrix multiplication is not always commutative, meaning the commutability of matrices depends on the specific matrices involved. 矩阵乘法并不总是可交换的，这意味着矩阵的可交换性取决于所涉及的特定矩阵。

The commutability of addition is a fundamental property in arithmetic. 加法的可交换性是算术中的一个基本属性。 | 近义词：interchangeability, exchangeability | 反义词：non-commutability, non-interchangeability | 词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From commute (v.) + -ability.  "Commute" comes from Latin "commutare"  meaning "to change completely, exchange, substitute," from "com-" (together) + "mutare" (to change).
