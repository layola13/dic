The word "natchnee" is not a recognized word in standard English. It appears to be a misspelling or a slang/dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you can provide more context or the intended word, I can offer a proper analysis.

However, assuming you might be looking for "naturally", which sounds somewhat similar, I provide the analysis below:

naturally:/ˈnætʃrəli/ | adv. | 自然地，当然地 | In a natural manner; as expected; of course. | She naturally assumed he'd be there. 她自然地认为他会在那儿。|  He's naturally gifted at music. 他天生就有音乐天赋。| 近义词: normally, typically, inherently, effortlessly | 反义词: artificially, unnaturally, awkwardly | 词性: 副词
