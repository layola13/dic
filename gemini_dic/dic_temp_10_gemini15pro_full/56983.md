词源:  The term "double-cross" originated in the early 20th century, likely from the marking of an "X" on a map or chart to indicate a planned rendezvous point, which could then be "double-crossed" with another "X" to indicate a change of plans or a trap.  "Double-crosser" followed naturally as the person performing this deceptive act.
