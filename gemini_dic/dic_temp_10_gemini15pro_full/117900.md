注意事项:

"Melor" is primarily used in Portuguese, not English.  While it might be understood in some contexts due to similarities with Romance languages,  "better" is the standard comparative form of "good" in English.  The provided examples are in Portuguese to illustrate usage in its native context.

Since "melor" is an adjective, it doesn't conjugate and isn't used in verb tenses in the same way as action verbs.  Therefore, many of the tense examples are not applicable.
