词源：
From Middle English *noppe, from Old English *noppe (“bur, knob, tuft of wool”), from Proto-Germanic *knuppo (“knob, button, tuft”). Cognate with Dutch nop (“bur, nap”), German Knopf (“button”). More at knob.  Sense of "diaper" first attested 1929, American English, originally as baby nappy. Possibly from earlier senses of "napkin, piece of cloth" and "soft, downy surface".

注意事项:

美式英语常用 diaper，英式英语常用 nappy。
