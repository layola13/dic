Etymology: From "consecrate" + "-ed" + "-ness".  "Consecrate" comes from Latin "consecratus", past participle of "consecrare" (to make sacred, dedicate), from "com-" (together) + "sacer" (sacred).  "-ed" forms the past participle and "-ness" forms a noun denoting a state or quality.  词源：来自“consecrate”+“-ed”+“-ness”。 “Consecrate”来自拉丁语“consecratus”，是“consecrare”（使神圣，奉献）的过去分词，来自“com-”（一起）+“sacer”（神圣）。 “-ed”构成过去分词，“-ness”构成表示状态或性质的名词。
