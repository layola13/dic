ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + substantiveness + -es (plural suffix).
"Non-" is a prefix meaning "not."
"Substantiveness" is derived from "substantive," which means "having a firm basis in reality and therefore important, meaningful, or valid."  It ultimately comes from the Latin "substantivus," meaning "standing firm."
"-es" is a plural suffix.
