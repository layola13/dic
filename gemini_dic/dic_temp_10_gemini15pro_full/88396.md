词源： From Japanese ヒロ (hiro), meaning "abundant," "generous," or "tolerant."  While the Japanese word doesn't directly translate to "hero,"  it can be used as a given name often associated with positive qualities.  The English usage of "hiro" as "hero" likely stems from a misspelling or mispronunciation, potentially influenced by popular culture.  It's not a standard English word and is much less common than "hero."
