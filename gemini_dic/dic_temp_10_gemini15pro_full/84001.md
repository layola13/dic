ETYMOLOGY->

"half-" from Old English "healf," meaning "side, part, portion."

"deprecatingly" from "deprecate" (verb), from Latin "deprecatus," past participle of "deprecari," meaning "to pray against, avert by prayer," from "de-" (down, away) + "precari" (to pray).  The sense shifted from averting evil by prayer to expressing disapproval or belittling. "-ingly" is an adverbial suffix.
