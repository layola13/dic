amyloid:/ˈæmɪlɔɪd/| n. adj.|淀粉样蛋白，淀粉样变性的|A waxy, translucent protein that is deposited in tissues and organs in certain diseases.|Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. 淀粉样斑块是阿尔茨海默病的标志。|近义词:plaque, deposit|反义词:None|词性:名词/形容词

Etymology:  From Greek *ámylon* "starch" + *-oeidēs* "like, resembling."  The term was coined because amyloid initially stained like starch.
