ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + detailed.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "detailed" comes from the verb "detail," meaning "to provide details."  The ultimate origin is from the Old French word "detaillier," meaning "to cut into pieces," reflecting the idea of breaking something down into its smaller parts.
