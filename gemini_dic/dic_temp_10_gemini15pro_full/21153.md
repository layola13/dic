词源:  "Blive" is likely a misspelling or a variation of the word "believe". "Believe" comes from Middle English _bileven_, from Old English _belīefan_  meaning "to hold dear, value, trust," composed of _be-_ "by, about, with" + _lēof_ "dear, beloved." The sense evolution suggests a progression from "holding something dear" to "trusting in its truth."
