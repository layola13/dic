ETYMOLOGY->
From "black" + "jack" (a common term for a small, often useless object).  The origin of the card game name is uncertain, but one theory suggests it came from a bonus payout offered if a player held the jack of spades and the ace of clubs (both black cards). The weapon's name likely comes from its dark color.
