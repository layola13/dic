genera's: /ˈdʒɛnərəz/ | n. | 属（生物分类）的 |  This is incorrect. "Genera" is the plural of "genus."  The possessive form would be "genus's" or "genera's" depending on whether you are referring to the singular or plural.  | Incorrect usage: The genera's characteristics are diverse. | Correct usage (singular): The genus's characteristics are well-documented. | Correct usage (plural): The genera's evolutionary relationships are complex. | synonyms: categories, classifications (loosely) | antonyms: N/A | noun
