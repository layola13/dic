PHRASE->
(Phrases using "asp's" are uncommon.  These use "asp" referring to the snake, which is a more common usage than "asp's" for the tree.)

Like an asp, she struck swiftly and silently. 她像白杨蛇一样迅速而无声地出击。

注意事项:
As mentioned above, "asp's" as plural of "asp" (the tree) is quite archaic.  The plural of aspirin is typically just "aspirin" or "aspirins".  "Asp's" referring to the snake is also uncommon; "asps" would be the more typical plural form.
