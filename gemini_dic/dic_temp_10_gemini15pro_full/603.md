ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *abracadabra, perhaps ultimately of Hebrew or Aramaic origin, of uncertain etymology.  One theory connects it to אברא כדברא avra kehdabra ('I will create as I speak'), an Aramaic incantation. Another relates it to the Hebrew phrase עַבְדָא כְּדַבְּרָא‎, ‘avda kedavra (“it will be created as I speak”).  It was used in amulets and inscribed on gemstones in the belief that it had magical powers, especially to ward off illness.
