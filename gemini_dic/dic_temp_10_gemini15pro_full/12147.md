The word "aruo" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a newly coined word, or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.  For example, knowing the language it might come from, or the specific context in which it was used, could allow me to speculate about its possible meaning or origin.

However, since the question asks for a formatted response even for a non-existent word, I can demonstrate the requested format using a real word, "what", which is often used in questions similar to the examples provided:

what /wɒt/ (UK), /hwɑːt/, /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. | 什么, 哪一个，多么 | used to ask for information about people or things |  What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | similar: which, how, whatever | opposite: N/A | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
