注意事项:
Since "guanghu" isn't an English word, these examples use it descriptively, like an adjective.  Native English speakers wouldn't construct sentences this way. It's more natural to use synonyms like "brilliant," "glorious," or "splendid."  For example, instead of "guanghu achievements," a native speaker would say "glorious achievements."
