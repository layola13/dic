ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *fortieste*, superlative of *forty*.  The original meaning of "forty" was not simply the number, but often used to represent a large, indefinite number.  In this context, "fortiest" meant something like "bravest of the many." The connection to the number forty is lost in modern usage.
