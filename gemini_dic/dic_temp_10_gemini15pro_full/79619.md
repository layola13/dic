ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *glose, from Late Latin glossa "difficult word, explanation of a difficult word," from Greek glōssa, glōtta "tongue, language, foreign word," related to glōkhis "point, arrowhead." The original sense was "a word needing explanation." The semantic shift from "explanation" to "superficial shine" occurred because glosses were often written in a brighter ink.
