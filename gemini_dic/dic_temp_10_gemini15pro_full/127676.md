PHRASE->

N/A (neg is a prefix, not a stand-alone word and therefore doesn't have phrases in the same way words do.)


注意事项:

"neg" itself is not a word, but a prefix.  Therefore, conjugation examples are using words that incorporate "neg" like neglect and negate.  Also, since it is a prefix, it doesn't have antonyms or synonyms directly, rather the words it forms do.  I have provided near synonyms for the prefix itself.  Phrase examples are not applicable for prefixes.
