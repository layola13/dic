The word "maytha" isn't a recognized word in standard English.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a slang term, or a word from a different language.  If you can provide more context (like where you encountered the word), I can try to offer more specific help.

However, since the prompt requests an explanation of the word "what", I will provide that information below, following the requested format.

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！| Synonym: which, how much, how many | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection
