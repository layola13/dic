The word "capian" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language or a specialized field.  If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis.

Since I cannot analyze "capian," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "axiom."
