ETYMOLOGY->
From de- (meaning "remove, reverse") + bunk (meaning "nonsense").  The word "bunk" originates from a speech given by Buncombe County representative Felix Walker in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820.  Walker insisted on delivering a long and irrelevant speech, claiming he was "speaking for Buncombe."  The term "buncombe" (later shortened to "bunk") came to mean meaningless political speech and eventually broadened to refer to any kind of nonsense.
