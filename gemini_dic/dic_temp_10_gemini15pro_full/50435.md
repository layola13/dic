ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *deprecatus*, past participle of *deprecari* ("to pray against, avert by prayer"), from *de-* ("down, away") + *precari* ("to pray").  Originally, the word meant to pray for deliverance from something, thus implying disapproval of that thing.  Over time, the religious connotation faded, and the word came to mean simply to express disapproval.
