词源: "Cost-out" is a compound word formed from the noun "cost" and the adverb/preposition "out."  "Cost" comes from Old French *coster (modern French coûter), ultimately from Latin constare "to stand firm, stand at a price, cost." "Out" has its roots in Old English ūt, meaning "out, outside, without, away."  The combined term "cost-out" emerged in the 20th century with the rise of modern business practices focused on efficiency and cost control.
