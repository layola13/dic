counterimage:/ˈkaʊntərˌɪmɪdʒ/ | n. | 反像，原像 |A counterimage is the set of all elements in the domain of a function that map to a given element in the codomain.  It is sometimes also called the preimage. |The counterimage of 0 under the function f(x) = x^2 is {0}.  函数 f(x) = x^2 中 0 的反像是 {0}。| synonym: preimage, inverse image | antonym: image | noun
