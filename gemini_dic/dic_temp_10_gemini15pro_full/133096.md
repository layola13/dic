PHRASE->

(由于nonerections是一个医学术语，通常不与常用短语搭配。因此，以下列出与"erectile dysfunction"相关的短语，这更常见于日常交流。)

dealing with erectile dysfunction = 应对勃起功能障碍
treatment for erectile dysfunction = 勃起功能障碍的治疗
causes of erectile dysfunction = 勃起功能障碍的原因
symptoms of erectile dysfunction = 勃起功能障碍的症状
living with erectile dysfunction = 与勃起功能障碍共存


注意事项:  由于 "nonerections"  是一个较为正式和医学的术语，在日常对话中较少使用，通常使用 "erectile dysfunction" 代替.
