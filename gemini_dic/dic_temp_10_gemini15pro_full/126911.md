ETYMOLOGY->
"Narc" and "narcs" ultimately derive from the Greek word "narkē" (νάρκη), meaning "numbness" or "torpor." This led to the word "narcotic," referring to drugs that induce numbness.  "Narc" as an abbreviation for "narcotics agent" arose from this connection to drugs.  The use of "narc" to mean "narcissist" is more recent and likely comes from the perceived self-absorption and lack of empathy associated with narcissistic personality disorder.
