词源：Old English *lād (unattested) "way, journey, course," specifically "carrying," from Proto-Germanic *laithuz (source also of Old Frisian lad "leading, load," Old Saxon led "way, journey," Dutch leed "sorrow, suffering," Old High German leit "way, journey, guidance," German Leid "sorrow, suffering," Gothic laþs "journey, way"), from PIE root *leit- "to go forth." The sense of "what is carried" developed in Old English.
