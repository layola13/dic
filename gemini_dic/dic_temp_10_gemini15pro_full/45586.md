词源：
The origin of "curmudgeon" is uncertain.  It first appeared in English in the mid-16th century.  Some speculate it might be related to the Middle French word *cor mugeon*, meaning "hoarded miser," although this connection is not definitively proven.  Another theory suggests a link to *cornmudgin*, a dialectal word possibly referring to a corn merchant who hoards grain.
