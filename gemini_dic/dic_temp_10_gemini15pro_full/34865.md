clinorhombic: /ˌklaɪnəˈrɒmbɪk/ /ˌklaɪnoʊˈrɑːmbɪk/
| adj. | 斜方晶系的 | Relating to or designating a crystal system characterized by three unequal axes intersecting at oblique angles.  A crystal system where all three axes are of unequal length, and all three intersect at angles other than 90 degrees. |  Clinorhombic crystals are often found in minerals like gypsum. 斜方晶系晶体常出现在石膏等矿物中。| triclinic, monoclinic |  isometric, tetragonal | adjective

Etymology:
From *clino- + rhombic. Clino- comes from Greek *klīnō* "I bend, incline." Rhombic comes from rhomb, ultimately from Greek *rhombos* "spinning top, magical wheel, rhombus."
