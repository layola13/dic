ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *manufacture*, from Latin *manu factus* "made by hand," past participle of *manu facere* "to make by hand." *Manu* is the ablative singular of *manus* "hand," and *facere* means "to make" or "to do."  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass production by machinery as well.
