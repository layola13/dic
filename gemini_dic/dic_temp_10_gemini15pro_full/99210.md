PHRASE->
There's no phrase commonly associated with "interclude" in the way "what's up" is associated with "what".  "Interclude" is a relatively formal verb and doesn't lend itself to idiomatic phrases.  It's typically used in more formal contexts.


词源:
From Latin *intercludere, from inter (“between”) + claudere (“to shut, to close”).  The original meaning was "to shut off, to block," but the meaning shifted to "to insert between" over time.
