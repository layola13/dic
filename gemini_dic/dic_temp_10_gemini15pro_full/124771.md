mses:/ɛmɛsˈiːz/ |n.| Mean Squared Errors (均方误差) |  A metric used in statistics to measure the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual values.  It is calculated by taking the average of the squares of the errors, where the error is the difference between the estimated value and the actual value.  Lower MSE values indicate better model performance.| The MSE of the regression model was 0.25, indicating a good fit. 回归模型的均方误差为 0.25，表明拟合良好。 |Synonyms:  mean squared deviation, MSD| Antonyms: N/A | noun
