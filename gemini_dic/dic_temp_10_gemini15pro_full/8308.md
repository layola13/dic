词源:  "Anti-" (against) + "Oriental" (relating to the East).  The term "Oriental" itself is now considered outdated and often offensive,  carrying connotations of colonialism and othering.  Therefore, the term "anti-oriental" is likewise problematic.  More precise and respectful terms like "anti-East Asian" or "anti-Asian" are generally preferred, specifying the particular group being targeted.
