ETYMOLOGY->
From "grog," a diluted rum drink named after Admiral Edward Vernon (1684-1757), nicknamed "Old Grog" because he wore grogram clothing. The term later expanded to refer to other diluted alcoholic beverages and the act of drinking them.  Eventually, it also came to describe a state of weakness or illness, often associated with excessive drinking.
