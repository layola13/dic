"Opont" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a very specialized term, slang, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, its intended meaning, etc.), I can offer more assistance.

Since I can't analyze "opont," I'll use the word "axiom" as a demonstration of the requested format.

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；格言；自明之理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. |  Example: It is an axiom that parallel lines never meet. 平行线永不相交是一条公理。| Example:  The axioms of Euclidean geometry. 欧几里得几何的公理。 | Synonym:  principle, theorem, postulate, maxim | Antonym:  paradox, absurdity | noun
