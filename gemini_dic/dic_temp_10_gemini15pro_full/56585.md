注意事项:
While grammatically "don'ts" can be conjugated as shown above, it's extremely unusual and often sounds awkward.  It is much more common to use "don't" or "doesn't" with the base form of the verb, as in "He doesn't eat meat" rather than "He don'ts eat meat."  The examples above are provided to fulfill the prompt's requirement for 24 example sentences across 12 tenses, but native speakers would generally avoid these constructions.  The word "don'ts" is almost exclusively used as a noun representing a list of prohibitions.
