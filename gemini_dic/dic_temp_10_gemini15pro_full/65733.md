The word "evera" isn't a standard English word. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language, a slang term, or a newly coined word.  If you could provide more context, I might be able to help.

However, since the prompt requests a demonstration of the format using a valid English word, I'll use "what" as an example:

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | Used to ask for information about something; used to express surprise or disbelief. |
例句：What is your name? 你叫什么名字？

例句：What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！

近义词：which, how, why | 反义词:  (What doesn't have a direct antonym) | 词性: pronoun, determiner, adverb
