词源:  From Middle English *loof, from Old Norse *lóf (“palm of the hand; weather side of a ship”). Related to Dutch loef (“weather gauge, windward”), German Luv (“lee, luff”).  The sense of "palm of the hand" is preserved in the obsolete term "a luff of the hand".  The nautical sense arose because the palm of the hand was used to test the wind direction.
