PHRASE-> (It is difficult to create natural phrases using "conic's" as a possessive.  It is more common to refer to "properties of a conic," "equation of a conic," etc.  Therefore, providing general phrases related to conics instead of the possessive form.)

the conic's equation  圆锥曲线的方程式
the conic's properties  圆锥曲线的性质
the conic's focus 圆锥曲线的焦点
the conic's directrix 圆锥曲线的准线
the conic's eccentricity 圆锥曲线的离心率


注意事项:
"Conic's" is not a standard English word. "Conic" is the noun, and the possessive form would generally be expressed as "the conic's" followed by the noun it possesses (e.g., "the conic's equation").
