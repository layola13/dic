ETYMOLOGY->

From Old English *heorð*, from Proto-Germanic *herþaz*. Cognate with Old Norse *hjarðr*, Old Saxon *herth*, Old Frisian *herth*, Middle Dutch *haert*, Dutch *haard*, Old High German *herd*, German *Herd*.  Related to Latin *cor*, *cordis* (heart). The connection likely stems from the hearth being the central and most important part of the home, much like the heart is to the body.
