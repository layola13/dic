half-jewish:/ˌhæf ˈdʒuːɪʃ/ | adj. | 半犹太的 |  Someone who has one parent who is Jewish and one parent who is not.

It's important to be sensitive to the nuances of identity when using this term. | My friend is half-Jewish; his mother is Jewish and his father is Catholic.  我的朋友是半犹太人；他母亲是犹太人，他父亲是天主教徒。 |  Part-Jewish | Not applicable (identity is not binary) | adjective
