interventricular:/ˌɪntərvenˈtrɪkjələr/| adj.|心室间的|Situated between the ventricles (especially of the heart).|The interventricular septum separates the left and right ventricles of the heart.|近义词:intraventricular|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps extraventricular)|词性:adjective

词源:
From inter- + ventricular.  "Inter-" is a Latin prefix meaning "between," and "ventricular" relates to the ventricles of the heart or brain.
