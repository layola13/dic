Etymology:
From brawny + -ness.  "Brawny" comes from the Middle English "brauni," meaning "muscular," likely related to the Old Norse "brá" meaning "eyelash, brow," perhaps with the original sense of having prominent brow ridges, a feature often associated with strength. The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
