注意事项:
"doze's" itself isn't a standard English word. The correct possessive form of "doze" would be "doze's" (singular possessive) or "dozes'" (plural possessive). However, using the plural "dozes" to refer to multiple instances of dozing is more common and natural than using the possessive form.  Therefore, the examples and explanations have been adjusted to reflect this.
