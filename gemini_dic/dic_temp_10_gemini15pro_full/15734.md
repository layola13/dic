balcks: /blæks/
| n. | blacks |  This is likely a misspelling of "blacks," which can be a noun referring to black people. However, using "blacks" as a noun is generally considered outdated and potentially offensive. It's better to use "Black people" or "Black individuals." |  In some contexts, "blacks" can refer to black clothing or pigments, but even then, it's less common than "black clothes" or "black pigments." | Example (if referring to clothing): He wore blacks to the funeral. 他穿黑衣参加葬礼。 | Synonym (if referring to people): Black people, African Americans (in the US context) | Antonym (if referring to people):  N/A (avoiding binary opposition for ethnic groups) | Noun
