heterotherm: /ˈhɛtərəˌθɜːrm/ | n. adj. | 变温动物；异温动物 | An animal that sometimes regulates its body temperature, but sometimes allows its temperature to fluctuate with the environment.  A heterotherm is intermediate between an endotherm and an ectotherm. | Bats are heterotherms, meaning they can switch between regulating their body temperature and letting it fluctuate.  蝙蝠是异温动物，这意味着它们可以在调节体温与让体温波动之间切换。|  The hummingbird exhibits heterothermic characteristics, entering torpor during cold nights.  蜂鸟表现出异温性，在寒冷的夜晚进入麻木状态。 | near synonyms: poikilotherm, partial endotherm | antonyms: homeotherm, endotherm | noun, adjective
