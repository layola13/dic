词源:  "Leerness" isn't a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism based on "leer" (meaning a suggestive or unpleasant look) and the suffix "-ness".  However, the intended meaning is probably closest to "emptiness" or "hollowness", which derive from Old English and Proto-Germanic roots.
