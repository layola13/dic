ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *buterfleoge*, equivalent to butter +‎ fly.  The reason for the name is uncertain.  A folk belief that butterflies were attracted to dairy products or that they stole milk or butter is documented, but not widely.  Another theory is that the name refers to the color of the excrement of certain species, particularly the brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx rhamni).
