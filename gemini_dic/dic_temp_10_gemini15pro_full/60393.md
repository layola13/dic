The word "eiasos" does not appear to be a valid English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer more assistance.

Since I can't analyze "eiasos," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, how, why (depending on context) | Antonym: (No direct antonym) | Pronoun/Determiner/Adverb
