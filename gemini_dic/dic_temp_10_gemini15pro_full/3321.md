The word "afforciament" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or etymological resources.  It is likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or archaic vocabulary. It's closest potential relative is the Italian word "rafforzamento," which means "reinforcement" or "strengthening." If you encountered this word somewhere, please provide the context so I can offer a more specific analysis.  Since I cannot analyze the non-existent word "afforciament," I will instead analyze the word "reinforcement" which is likely related to the intended meaning.
