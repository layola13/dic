microstylous: /ˈmaɪkroʊˌstaɪləs/ | adj. | 短花柱的 | Having a short style, especially one that is shorter than the stamens. This often leads to self-pollination. | Example: Microstylous primroses tend to self-fertilize. 短花柱的报春花倾向于自花授粉。

Example:  The microstylous form of the flower prevents cross-pollination.  这种花的短花柱形式阻止了异花授粉。 | 近义词: short-styled | 反义词: longistylous, macrostylous | 词性: adjective
