ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English cranke, from Old English cranc (“a bend, winding”), from Proto-Germanic *kranką (“bent, crooked”). Cognate with Dutch krank (“sick, ill”), German krank (“sick, ill”), Swedish krank (“sick, infirm”).  The meaning shifted from "bent" to "a bent handle" to "a device for turning" and then figuratively to "eccentric" (perhaps from the idea of a mind working in a twisted way).
