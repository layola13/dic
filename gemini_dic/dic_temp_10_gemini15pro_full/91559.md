hyper-oxygenation:/ˌhaɪpərˌɒksɪdʒəˈneɪʃən/ /ˌhaɪpərˌɑːksɪdʒəˈneɪʃən/| n.|过氧化；超氧化|The process of increasing the oxygen content beyond normal levels, either in the body as a whole or in a specific organ or tissue.|Example: Hyper-oxygenation before surgery can reduce the risk of complications.  术前过氧化可以减少并发症的风险。

Example:  Divers sometimes use hyper-oxygenation techniques before deep dives. 潜水员有时会在深潜前使用过氧化技术。|近义词: oxygen enrichment|反义词: hypoxia, anoxia|词性: noun

Etymology:  From hyper- (meaning "over, excessive") + oxygenation (the process of adding or combining with oxygen).  The root "oxygen" comes from the French oxygène, coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier.
