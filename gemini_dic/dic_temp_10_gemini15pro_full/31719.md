"Chatbot" is a portmanteau of "chat" and "robot." "Chat" originates from the late 19th century, a shortened form of "chatter," meaning to talk rapidly or idly. "Robot" comes from the Czech word "robota," meaning "forced labor," coined by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).
