Etymology->
From Middle English foisten, fosten (“to deceive, cheat, impose upon”), probably from Anglo-Norman *fusten, from Old French fust (“wine cask”), from Latin fustis (“club, staff”). The original notion may have been that of inserting a plug into a cask of wine to stop it up or tapping it by driving in a spigot. From this, the meaning evolved to fraudulently adulterating wine or more generally deceiving someone.
