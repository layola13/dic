词源:

"brog" (shoe):  From Irish and Scottish Gaelic *brōg, from Old Norse brók "trousers, breeches." Originally referred to a type of trouser and shoe combination worn in Scotland and Ireland.  Over time, the term came to refer specifically to the shoe.

"brogue" (accent):  From the same Gaelic root as "brog" (shoe). The connection likely arises from the association of a particular accent with the people who wore brogues.
