PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Nonjournalistically" is not typically used in set phrases.  It functions as a standalone adverb.


词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "journalistic" (adjective relating to journalism) + "-ally" (suffix forming adverbs).  Ultimately derived from "journal," from Old French "journal" (daily).
