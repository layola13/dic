The word "muling" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, it's slang, a regionalism, or from a specialized field.  It could also be a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, what you think it might mean), I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis.

However, I can explain how to analyze a word using the format you provided.  Let's use the word "question" as an example:

question: /ˈkwɛstʃən/ (US) /ˈkwestʃən/ (UK) | n. v. | 问题；疑问；询问 |  A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information.  |  She asked a question about the assignment. 她问了一个关于作业的问题。 | Example: He questioned the witness. 他询问了证人。 | Synonyms: query, inquiry, interrogation | Antonyms: answer, reply | noun; verb
