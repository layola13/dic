词源:
The origin of "hassle" is uncertain. One theory suggests it may be related to the earlier word "harass," which has roots in the Old French word "harasser," meaning "to set a dog on." Another theory proposes a connection to the Low German word "hazel," referring to tangled thread or yarn, implying a sense of confusion or difficulty.  A third possibility is an origin in American slang, possibly from the 1940s or 1950s.
