词源: From Middle English *halidome*, from Old English *hāligdōm* ("holiness, sanctuary, relic"), from *hālig* ("holy") + *dōm* ("judgment, doom, law, statute, dignity, glory, power").  The word's meaning shifted over time from abstract concepts of holiness and sanctity to physical places and objects associated with them.
