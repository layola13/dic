词源: "Funky" originates from the 1930s, initially meaning "musty" or "earthy," later evolving to describe a strong, distinctive, and often rhythmic style of music (funk). "Butt" is a colloquial term for buttocks. The combination "funky-butt" likely emerged in the latter half of the 20th century with the rise of funk music, referencing the rhythmic movements associated with the genre.
