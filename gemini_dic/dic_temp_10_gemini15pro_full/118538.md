mesolite:/ˈmɛzəˌlaɪt/ | n. | 中沸石,丝光沸石 |A fibrous zeolite mineral, a hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate.  It's often found in cavities in basaltic rocks. | Example 1: The geologist identified the white, needle-like crystals as mesolite.  地质学家将这些白色的针状晶体鉴定为中沸石。

Example 2:  Mesolite is often associated with other zeolites like natrolite and scolecite. 中沸石常与其他沸石，如钠沸石和钙沸石伴生。 | 近义词: natrolite, scolecite | 反义词:  None (No direct antonym for a specific mineral) | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek μέσος (mésos, “middle”) + λίθος (líthos, “stone”), because its composition is intermediate between natrolite and scolecite.
