Etymology->
From Anglo-French *aler, from aler "to go," from Latin ambulare "to walk, go." The original sense was "to go, to travel," which evolved into "to go to summon," and then to "a call to arms."  The meaning shifted to "a warning of danger" in the 19th century, with the rise of mechanical warning devices.
