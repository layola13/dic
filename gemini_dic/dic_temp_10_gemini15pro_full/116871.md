词源：From Middle English *mai, *may, from Old English mæg (first person singular present indicative of magan (“may; to be able; to have power”)), from Proto-Germanic *magō (“I can, I am able”), from Proto-Indo-European *méǵh₂ō (“I can, I am powerful”). Cognate with Scots may (“may”), West Frisian mei (“may”), Dutch mag (“may”), German mag (“may; like”), Danish må (“may; must”), Swedish må (“may”), Icelandic má (“may”). Related also to English might. The month name is from Latin Māius (“May”), possibly from Maia, an Italic goddess of spring and growth.
