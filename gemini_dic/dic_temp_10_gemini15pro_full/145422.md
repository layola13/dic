ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + charge.  The verb sense dates back to the late 16th century, while the noun sense emerged in the early 17th century.  "Over-" is a common prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much."  "Charge" originates from the Old French word "chargier," meaning "to load" or "burden," ultimately derived from the Late Latin "carricare," related to "carrus" meaning "cart" or "wagon."
