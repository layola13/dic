词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "computerized" (past participle of the verb "computerize," meaning "to equip with or convert to the use of computers"). The verb "computerize" comes from "computer" + "-ize" (suffix meaning "to make or cause to be").  The word "computer" ultimately comes from the Latin word "computare," meaning "to calculate."
