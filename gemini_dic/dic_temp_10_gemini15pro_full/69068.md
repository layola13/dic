faulting:/ˈfɔːltɪŋ/ | n. |断层作用；故障；缺点|A fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock.  The movement of the blocks can be horizontal, vertical, or oblique. It is the process of cracking that produces faults. In geology, faulting is often associated with earthquakes.|The San Andreas Fault is a well-known example of faulting. 圣安地列斯断层是断层作用的一个著名例子。

The faulting in this area has created a complex landscape.  这个地区的断层作用造成了复杂的地貌。|近义词：fracturing, displacement, slipping|反义词： mending, repairing|词性：名词

faulting:/ˈfɔːltɪŋ/ | adj. |有缺点的；有故障的 | Characterized by faults; imperfect.  This is a less common usage, usually applied to systems or processes, not individuals.| The faulting electrical system caused the power outage. 有缺陷的电气系统导致了停电。

The report criticized the faulting logic in the proposal. 报告批评了提案中错误的逻辑。|近义词： flawed, defective, faulty|反义词： perfect, flawless, intact|词性：形容词
