PHRASE->
No phrases commonly used in modern English with "kenn" as it's archaic.  Instead of providing irrelevant phrases, here are some ways "kenn" could be used archaically in phrases, keeping in mind its meaning of "to know" or "to be aware of":

1.  Do ye kenn the way? (Do you know the way?)
2.  I dinna kenn what ye mean. (I don't know what you mean.)
3.  He kenned the risks. (He knew the risks.)
4.  She kenned the truth of the matter. (She knew the truth of the matter.)
5.  They kenned the consequences. (They knew the consequences.)

NOTE: While these are grammatically correct based on the archaic usage of "kenn," they would sound unnatural in modern conversation. Using "know" would be more appropriate.
