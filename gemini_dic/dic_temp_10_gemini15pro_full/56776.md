词源:  "dopier" is the comparative form of "dopey," which originated in the late 19th century. "Dopey" itself likely comes from "dope," which originally referred to a thick liquid or sauce, and later came to mean a narcotic drug.  The connection lies in the idea that someone under the influence of drugs might appear slow-witted or foolish.
