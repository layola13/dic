loured:/laʊrd/ | v. | 皱眉；阴沉着脸；显得不祥 | To have a dark or threatening appearance; to look sullen or angry. | The sky loured, threatening rain. 天空阴沉沉的，预示着要下雨。| 近义词：frowned, scowled, darkened | 反义词：brightened, cleared | 动词

词源: From Middle English *louren, from Old Norse *lūra (“to frown, scowl”), from Proto-Germanic *lūrą (“to lower, bend down”).  Cognate with Swedish lura (“to trick, deceive”), Danish lure (“to lurk, lie in wait”), Icelandic lúri (“a sad face, a frown”).  The sense development is probably from "lowering one's brows" to "having a dark or threatening aspect."
