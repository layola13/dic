词源：
The term "blackleg" originated in the 18th century, initially referring to a disease in cattle and sheep that caused black discoloration of the legs.  Later, it was used metaphorically to describe someone who betrayed their colleagues or acted in a deceitful manner.  The application to strikebreakers likely arose from the idea that they were "infecting" the workforce with their disloyalty.
