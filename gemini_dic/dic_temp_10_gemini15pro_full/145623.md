overconsolidation:/ˌoʊvərˌkənˌsɑːlɪˈdeɪʃən/ | n. |过度固结|The process by which a soil has been subjected to a greater effective stress than the present overburden pressure, resulting in a lower void ratio and higher shear strength than would normally be expected for the present overburden pressure.  |The clay layer exhibited signs of overconsolidation, likely due to the removal of a thick ice sheet thousands of years ago.|近义词:preconsolidation|反义词:underconsolidation|词性:名词

Etymology:
From over- + consolidation, from Late Latin consolidātiōn- (stem of consolidātiō), from consolidāre "to make solid," from com- "together" + solidāre "to make solid," from solidus "solid."
