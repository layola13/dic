daao: This doesn't appear to be a recognized English word. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a slang term, acronym, or word from another language.  Since there's no established English word "daao", I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe it might mean, I can try to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's an acronym, knowing what each letter stands for would be helpful. If it's from another language, specifying the language would allow me to look up its meaning and provide the information you requested.

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wɑːt/ (US) |pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 |Used to ask for information specifying something. |例句：What is your name? 你叫什么名字？
