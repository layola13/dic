词源：  "Fatigation" is likely a blend of "fatigue" and "agitation."  "Fatigue" comes from the Old French *fatiguer*, meaning "to tire." "Agitation" comes from the Latin *agitare*, meaning "to put in motion, drive, stir up."  While "fatigation" isn't a standard English word, its construction suggests a state of being both tired and restless or uneasy.
