hyperoxymuriatic:/ˌhaɪpərˌɒksiˌmjʊəriˈætɪk/ | adj. | 过氧氯酸的；过于氯化的 |  Relating to or containing an excessive amount of oxymuriatic acid (an outdated name for chlorine).  Now largely obsolete, it was used to describe compounds or solutions believed to contain a higher oxidation state of chlorine than in muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid). |  In early 19th-century chemistry, "hyperoxymuriatic acid" was a term used to describe a hypothetical acid believed to be present in chlorine gas and its compounds. | 近义词: chloric (in some contexts) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective

PHRASE->
(This word is obsolete and doesn't have common phrases associated with it.  Providing general phrases with 'what'):
What's up? = 怎么了？/ 你好吗？
What the hell! = 搞什么鬼！
what if = 如果...会怎么样
what for = 为了什么
no matter what = 无论如何

词源： "Hyper-" (Greek: over, excessive) + "oxy-" (Greek: sharp, acid) + "muriatic" (from "muria," Latin for brine, referring to hydrochloric acid).  So it literally means "overly acidic related to brine."
