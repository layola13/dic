Etymology: From "griffin" + "-ism".  "Griffin" comes from the Old French "grifon," ultimately from the Latin "gryphus," borrowed from the Greek "γρύψ" (gryps), referring to a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle.  The suffix "-ism" denotes a characteristic or doctrine.
