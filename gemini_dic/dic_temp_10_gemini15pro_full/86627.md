helium:/ˈhiːliəm/| n.|氦|A chemical element, a colorless, odorless, inert gas, the lightest noble gas, present in the sun's atmosphere and in natural gas. It is used as a coolant, in balloons, and as a lifting gas.|Example 1: Helium is used in balloons because it is lighter than air. 氦气用于气球，因为它比空气轻。

Example 2:  Helium is a noble gas and does not react with other elements. 氦是一种惰性气体，不与其他元素发生反应。|Synonym: None (as it's a specific element)|Antonym: None (as it's a specific element)|noun
