The word "hsiang" appears to be a misspelling, possibly of "xiang" which, depending on the context and tones in Mandarin Chinese, could have several meanings.  However, since the prompt requests an English word analysis, I will assume the intended word is "**xiang**" within a context where it represents a transliteration of the Chinese word for "fragrant" or "incense."  Therefore, I will analyze the closest English equivalent: **fragrant**.


fragrant:/ˈfreɪɡrənt/| adj.|香的，芬芳的|Pleasingly sweet-smelling.|The air was fragrant with the scent of jasmine. 空气中弥漫着茉莉花的香味。|The baker's delicious, fragrant bread filled the whole street with its aroma. 面包师美味芬芳的面包香味弥漫了整条街。|近义词：aromatic, perfumed, sweet-smelling|反义词:foul, stinky, putrid|词性:adjective
