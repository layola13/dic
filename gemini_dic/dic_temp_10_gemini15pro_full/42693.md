counterterm:/ˈkaʊntərˌtɜːrm/| n. |反项，抵消项|A term added to a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian in quantum field theory to compensate for undesirable effects, such as infinities arising from loop calculations. It effectively cancels out the unwanted contributions and allows for meaningful physical predictions. |Example: The counterterm in the Lagrangian helped regulate the divergent integral.  拉格朗日量中的反项帮助调节了发散积分。

Example:  Calculating the correct counterterm is crucial for renormalization.  计算正确的反项对于重整化至关重要。|Synonym: compensating term, regularization term|Antonym: N/A|noun
