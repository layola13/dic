词源:  From Old English *langian "to grow long," also "to yearn, long for," from Proto-Germanic *langojanan (source also of Old Saxon langon, Old Frisian langia "to long for," Old High German langen "to grow long, yearn for," German verlangen "to demand, desire," Gothic galangjan "to prevent"). The original sense is of "stretching out" after something.


注意事项:  在金融语境中，"longs" 通常用作名词复数，指持有某种资产多头头寸的交易者。
