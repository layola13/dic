nonsusceptibilities:/ˌnɒnsəˌsɛptɪˈbɪlɪtiz/
| n. | 非易感性；不易感性；不敏感性|The state or quality of not being susceptible; lack of susceptibility.  Specifically, in medicine, resistance or lack of vulnerability to a disease, infection, or drug.|The doctor was puzzled by the patient's nonsusceptibilities to several common antibiotics. 医生对病人对几种常见抗生素的不敏感感到困惑。| 近义词: resistances, immunities | 反义词: susceptibilities, vulnerabilities | 词性: 名词

词源:
non- (prefix):  Meaning "not," from Latin non "not."
susceptible (adjective):  From Late Latin susceptibilis "capable of receiving," from Latin suscipere "to take up, undertake, admit, receive," from sub "up from below" + capere "to take, seize."
-ity (suffix):  Forms nouns of quality or condition, from French -ité and Latin -itas.
