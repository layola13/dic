cdk:/siːdiːˈkeɪ/ |n.| 细胞周期蛋白依赖性激酶 (cyclin-dependent kinase)|A type of enzyme that controls the cell cycle. These enzymes are crucial for cell growth and division.|The activity of CDKs is tightly regulated to ensure proper cell cycle progression. CDKs play a critical role in regulating the cell cycle.|近义词: kinase|反义词: (No direct antonym, but inhibitors like p21 and p27 block CDK activity)|词性:noun
