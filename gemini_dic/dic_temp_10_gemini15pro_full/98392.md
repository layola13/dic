insolidity:/ˌɪnsəˈlɪdəti/
|n.|不坚固，不牢固；不稳定性|lack of firmness, stability, or solidity; weakness|The insolidity of the structure made it unsafe.  这栋建筑的结构不牢固，使它变得不安全。| 近义词：frailty, weakness, instability, precariousness|反义词：solidity, firmness, stability, strength|词性:名词

insolubility:/ˌɪnsɒljuˈbɪləti/
|n.|不能解决；不溶性|The state or quality of being insoluble; incapable of being dissolved, explained, or solved.|The insolubility of the problem frustrated the team.  这个问题的无法解决让团队感到沮丧。|近义词：unsolvability, impenetrability,  indissolubility (for not being able to be dissolved)| 反义词：solubility, resolvability |词性:名词


*It seems you've mixed up two words.  "Insolidity" refers to a lack of physical solidity, while "insolubility" refers to something that can't be dissolved or solved.  There is no word "insolidity" meaning "unsolvable."  I've provided entries for both.*


ETYMOLOGY->

insolidity:  From in- (not) + solidity (firmness).  Solidity comes from Latin solidus (solid, whole).

insolubility: From in- (not) + solubility. Solubility comes from Latin solvere (to loosen, dissolve) + -bilis (capable of being).
