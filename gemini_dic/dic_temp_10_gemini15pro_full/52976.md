词源: From Old French disner (Modern French dîner), from Vulgar Latin *disjūnāre (“to break one's fast”), from Latin dis- (“apart, away”) + jejunare (“to fast”), from jejunus (“empty, fasting”).  Originally meaning "to break one's fast," hence "to have the midday meal," later shifting to "the main meal of the day," regardless of the time.
