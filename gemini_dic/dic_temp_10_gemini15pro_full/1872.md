acrospore:/ˈækrəˌspɔːr/| n.|顶生孢子|A spore borne at the apex of a sporophore or filament. It is typical of certain fungi, including members of the order Mucorales.|The acrospore is located at the tip of the sporangiophore. 顶生孢子位于孢子梗的顶端。

The researchers identified the fungus by examining its characteristic acrospores. 研究人员通过检查其特征性的顶生孢子来识别这种真菌。|近义词:apical spore, terminal spore|反义词:basidiospore, ascospore|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *ákros* (at the tip, extreme) + *sporá* (seed, a sowing)

USAGE->
一般现在时:
An acrospore forms at the tip of a sporangiophore. = 顶生孢子在孢子梗的顶端形成。
Some fungi produce acrospores as part of their reproductive cycle. = 一些真菌产生顶生孢子作为其繁殖周期的一部分。


一般过去时:
The scientists observed that the acrospore developed over a period of several days. = 科学家们观察到顶生孢子在几天内发育。
The researchers identified the species based on the morphology of the acrospore. = 研究人员根据顶生孢子的形态鉴定了该物种。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied acrospore development in various fungal species. = 研究人员已经研究了各种真菌物种中顶生孢子的发育。
Mycology has advanced our understanding of how acrospores contribute to fungal reproduction. = 真菌学提高了我们对顶生孢子如何促进真菌繁殖的理解。


过去完成时:
Before the study, scientists had not fully understood the function of the acrospore. = 在研究之前，科学家们还没有完全了解顶生孢子的功能。
After the fungus had matured, the acrospores had been released into the environment. = 真菌成熟后，顶生孢子被释放到环境中。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the role of acrospores in fungal dispersal. = 进一步的研究将调查顶生孢子在真菌传播中的作用。
Scientists will analyze the genetic makeup of acrospores to understand their evolutionary history. = 科学家将分析顶生孢子的基因组成，以了解它们的进化历史。


虚拟语气:
If the acrospore were damaged, the fungus might not be able to reproduce effectively. = 如果顶生孢子受损，真菌可能无法有效繁殖。
If researchers had access to more advanced equipment, they could study acrospore development in greater detail. = 如果研究人员能够获得更先进的设备，他们就可以更详细地研究顶生孢子的发育。


被动语态:
The acrospore is produced by the fungus during reproduction. = 顶生孢子是由真菌在繁殖过程中产生的。
The development of the acrospore is influenced by environmental factors. = 顶生孢子的发育受环境因素的影响。


疑问句:
How does the acrospore contribute to fungal reproduction? = 顶生孢子是如何促进真菌繁殖的？
What are the key characteristics of an acrospore? = 顶生孢子的主要特征是什么？


否定句:
The acrospore is not found in all types of fungi. = 并非所有类型的真菌中都存在顶生孢子。
The researchers did not observe any abnormalities in the acrospore development. = 研究人员没有观察到顶生孢子发育中的任何异常。


PHRASE->
acrospore formation = 顶生孢子形成
acrospore morphology = 顶生孢子形态
acrospore development = 顶生孢子发育
acrospore germination = 顶生孢子萌发
acrospore release = 顶生孢子释放
