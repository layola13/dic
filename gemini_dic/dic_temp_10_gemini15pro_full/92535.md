hypsometer:/haɪˈpsɒmɪtər (UK) / /haɪˈpsɑːmɪtər (US)/
n.|测高仪，沸点测高计|An instrument for measuring altitude, especially above sea level, by determining the boiling point of a liquid.  It works on the principle that the boiling point of a liquid decreases as the atmospheric pressure decreases (which happens as altitude increases).|The mountaineer used a hypsometer to determine his altitude.|altimeter, altitude meter|depth gauge|noun
ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek ὕψος (húpsos, “height”) + μέτρον (métron, “measure”).
