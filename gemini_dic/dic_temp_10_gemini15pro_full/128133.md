词源:  "Nethermore" is a combination of "nether" (meaning lower, beneath, or under) and "more."  "Nether" comes from Old English "niþera," comparative of "niþe" (down, beneath).  "More" comes from Old English "māra," comparative of "micel" (much, great).  The sense is of something being so far down or beneath that it will not rise again.
