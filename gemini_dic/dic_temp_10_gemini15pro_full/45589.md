词源:
From Middle English coraunt, via Old French, from Medieval Latin corinthus, ultimately from Ancient Greek Κόρινθος (Kórinthos, “Corinth”).  Originally referring specifically to small raisins imported from Corinth. The sense was later extended to other small dried fruits and then to certain berries.
