orbitosphenoidal: /ˌɔːrbɪtəʊˈsfɛnɔɪdəl/ | adj. | 眶蝶骨的 | Relating to the orbitosphenoid, a small, paired bone that forms part of the human skull, located in the sphenoid bone, contributing to the posterior wall of the orbit. | The orbitosphenoid bone is a small, irregular bone found in the skull. | 近义词: sphenoidal | 反义词: None | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
From 'orbito-' (relating to the orbit) + 'sphenoidal' (relating to the sphenoid bone). Ultimately derived from Latin 'orbita' (track, course) and Greek 'sphēn' (wedge) + '-oeides' (like, resembling).
