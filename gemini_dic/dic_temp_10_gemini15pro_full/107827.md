larboard: /ˈlɑːrbərd/ (historical) | n. |左舷|The left side of a ship or boat, looking forward.|The captain ordered the helmsman to turn the ship to larboard.| 近义词: port| 反义词: starboard| noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *laddeborde*, from lade (“to load, unload”) + bord (“side of a ship”).  The term originated because the left side of a ship was traditionally the loading side.  Over time, the pronunciation shifted to "larboard."  It was eventually replaced by "port" to avoid confusion with "starboard" due to their similar sounds.
