词源：
From hack (v.) "to cut, chop," from Old English *haccian (implied by hacce "axe," hæcc "hatch, grating"). The computing sense emerged in the 1970s in the jargon of MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club.  The original meaning in this context was "to write computer programs for enjoyment, not for practical purposes."  The negative connotation of illegal access developed later.
