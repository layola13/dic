USAGE->

词源：From Modern Latin *curvilinearis*, from Latin *curvus* (“curved”) + *linea* (“line”).

用法说明：Curvilinearity and its plural form curvilinearities refer to the state or quality of being curved or nonlinear.  It is often used in technical contexts, such as mathematics, physics, and engineering, to describe relationships or patterns that deviate from a straight line.  It can also be used more generally to describe curved shapes or forms in art, architecture, and other fields.
