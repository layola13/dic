注意事项: "parentings" itself is not a standard English word. While grammatically correct as a plural form, the singular "parenting" is generally used to encompass all aspects of raising children.  Using "parentings" implies distinct types or styles of parenting, and it's best used in that context.  If referring to the general concept of raising children, "parenting" is preferred.
