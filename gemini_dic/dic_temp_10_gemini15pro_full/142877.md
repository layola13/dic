ETYMOLOGY->
"out of plumb" originates from the word "plumb," which itself comes from the Latin "plumbum" meaning "lead."  Historically, a plumb line, a string with a lead weight at the bottom, was used to determine verticality.  Therefore, "out of plumb" literally means "not aligned with a plumb line," hence not vertical.
