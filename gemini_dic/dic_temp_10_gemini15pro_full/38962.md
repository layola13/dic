configurationally:/kənˌfɪɡjəˈreɪʃənəli/ | adv. | 构型地，构象地 |  Relating to or determined by configuration, especially in chemistry, referring to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule that cannot be changed without breaking and reforming bonds. | The two molecules are configurationally different, meaning they are stereoisomers that cannot be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. 这两个分子在构型上不同，这意味着它们是立体异构体，不能通过围绕单键旋转而相互转化。|  The properties of polymers are often configurationally dependent. 聚合物的性质通常取决于其构型。| 近义词: stereochemically, isomerically | 反义词: conformationally | 词性: 副词
