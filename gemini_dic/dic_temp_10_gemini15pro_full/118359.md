"merithal" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It doesn't appear to have a valid etymology or established usage. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from a fictional language.  Without more context, it's impossible to provide a meaningful analysis.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, such as a book, movie, or conversation, I may be able to offer more insights.


However, since the prompt requests demonstrations of grammatical concepts using "what," I will provide examples using "what" as requested:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) |pron. det. adv. | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, how | Antonym: N/A (interrogative words don't typically have antonyms) | Parts of Speech: pronoun, determiner, adverb
