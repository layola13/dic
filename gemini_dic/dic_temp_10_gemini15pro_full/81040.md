注意事项:
The word "graffage" is relatively uncommon in modern English.  "Grafting" is the more commonly used term.  The provided examples use "graffage" to fulfill the prompt's requirements, but be aware that "grafting" is generally preferred.  The etymology of "graffage" comes from the French word "greffage," ultimately derived from the Latin "graphium" meaning "stylus" or "pencil" – likely referring to the pointed tools used in grafting.
