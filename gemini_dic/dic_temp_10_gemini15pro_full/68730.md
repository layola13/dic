Etymology->

From farm + -able.  The suffix "-able" comes from the Old French "-able"  and ultimately from the Latin "-abilis", meaning "capable of being".  The word "farm" comes from the Old French "ferme", meaning "lease," which itself derives from the Latin "firma", meaning "fixed payment."  Essentially, the word "farmable" describes land capable of being leased or worked for agricultural purposes.
