nonflakilyness's: /ˌnɒnˈfleɪkɪlinəsɪz/ | n. | 不薄片状; 坚固性; 可靠性 |  The state or quality of not being flaky; reliability; solidity.  This word is not commonly used and might be considered awkward or overly complex. It's formed by adding multiple suffixes to "flaky," making it quite cumbersome. |  The nonflakilyness's of the new software impressed the team.  新软件的稳定性给团队留下了深刻的印象。|  stability, reliability, solidity, robustness | flakiness, fragility, unreliability | noun

Etymology:
"Flaky" originates from "flake" (Old Norse *flaka, "to flake, peel off"), referring to something that breaks apart easily.  "Non-" is a prefix indicating negation. "-y" turns the adjective "flaky" into the noun "flakiness". "-ness" creates the abstract noun "nonflakilyness" from the adjective "nonflaky".  The final "'s" indicates possession.
