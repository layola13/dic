coss:/kɒs/| n.| Algebra: a function that is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle| An algebraic term, short for cosine.  It represents the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. |Example: The coss of 30 degrees is √3/2.  30度的余弦值是√3/2。|近义词: cosine|反义词: (No direct antonym, but related: secant)|词性: noun (abbreviation)

PHRASE->

(While "coss" itself doesn't have common phrases associated with it as an abbreviation, the full term "cosine" does.  Therefore, I provide phrases using "cosine"):

find the cosine =  求余弦
cosine function = 余弦函数
cosine of an angle = 角的余弦
cosine rule = 余弦定理
inverse cosine = 反余弦
