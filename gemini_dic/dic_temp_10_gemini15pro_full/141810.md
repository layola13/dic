orbitals:/ˈɔːbɪtlz/ | n. |轨道|Regions of space around the nucleus of an atom where electrons are likely to be found.  These regions are described by mathematical equations and represent the probability of finding an electron at a particular location. |Electrons fill the atom's orbitals in a specific order. 电子按特定顺序填充原子的轨道。| shells, subshells |  n/a | noun
