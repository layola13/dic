The word "odmyl" is not a recognized word in English.  It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word). Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you meant a different word, please provide it, and I will be happy to help.

If you are interested in learning about word formation or neologisms, I can provide information on those topics.  Please let me know.


Since I cannot analyze "odmyl," I will provide an analysis for the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format:


what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wɑːt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！| Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym: (No direct antonym for "what") | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb, Interjection
