词源: From Old English *cyning, from Proto-Germanic *kuningaz (“king”). Related to Old Norse konungr, Old High German kuning, and Gothic  kuningas.  The word "eiking" specifically refers to the *act* of making a king, rather than the king himself, although it can be used poetically as a synonym for "king".  It's related to the more common modern word "king" but is much less frequently used.
