注意事项:

"Nole" is primarily a regional term, more common in the southeastern United States.  While it can refer to other small rodents, it's most often used to describe voles.  Therefore, "vole" and "field mouse" are the most suitable synonyms.  There isn't a direct antonym for an animal like a nole, but a predator that hunts them, like a hawk or owl, could be considered an opposing concept.
