词源: misshapen + -ness + -'s (possessive)

"Misshapen" comes from the Old English "mis-" (meaning "wrong" or "bad") + "sceapen" (meaning "shaped").  "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  The final "-'s" indicates possession, although its use with an abstract noun like "misshapenness" is less common and might be considered slightly awkward in some contexts.  It would likely only be used to specify the misshapenness belonging to a particular instance or example of something.
