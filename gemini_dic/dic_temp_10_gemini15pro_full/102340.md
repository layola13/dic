注意事项:  As requested, no markdown formatting was used.  "iwo" is not a standard English word outside of the context of Iwo Jima or the internet slang usage provided.  Therefore, many of the examples are contrived to fit the specific word.  A comprehensive response is provided for "what" given the limitations of "iwo".
