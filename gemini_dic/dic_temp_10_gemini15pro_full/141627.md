optics's:/ˈɒptɪksɪz/ | n. | 光學的（罕見，通常直接用optics）|  A possessive form of optics, rarely used and generally considered incorrect.  The field of optics deals with the behavior and properties of light. | Example: *This is rarely used and sounds incorrect.* Trying to say something like "Optics's principles are fascinating" is better phrased as "The principles of optics are fascinating." | 近义詞: (For "optics" itself)  optical science, photonics | 反義詞: None | 词性: Noun (possessive, but non-standard)
