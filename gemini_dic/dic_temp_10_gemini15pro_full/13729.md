Etymology:
From French aubaine, from Provençal aubana, from Old Provençal albaana "dawn," from Latin *albāna, from albus "white."  The original sense was "the right of a feudal lord to confiscate the goods of a foreigner who died within his domain."  This practice was often carried out at dawn, hence the connection with "albaana." Over time, the meaning shifted to "windfall" or "unexpected gain."
