anfinsen:/ˈænfɪnsən/| n.|安芬森 (通常指Christian Boehmer Anfinsen)|Anfinsen refers to Christian Boehmer Anfinsen (1916-1995), an American biochemist who shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on ribonuclease, especially concerning the connection between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation.  It can also refer to Anfinsen's dogma, which states that, at least for small globular proteins, the native structure is determined only by the protein's amino acid sequence.|Anfinsen shared the Nobel Prize with Stanford Moore and William Howard Stein. 安芬森与斯坦福·摩尔和威廉·霍华德·斯坦因共同获得了诺贝尔奖。|近义词: (referring to the dogma) thermodynamic hypothesis|反义词: None|词性:Noun (Proper Noun)
