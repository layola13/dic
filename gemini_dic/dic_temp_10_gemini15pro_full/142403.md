The word "orus" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a technical term in a specific field, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.

However, since the prompt requests examples of grammar usage with "what," I will provide those below, assuming "what" functions as an interrogative pronoun or adjective:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wɑːt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner (adjective)| 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonym: which, whatever | Antonym:  N/A (interrogative words don't typically have antonyms) | parts of speech: pronoun, determiner
