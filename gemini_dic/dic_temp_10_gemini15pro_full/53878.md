discontinuousnesses:/ˌdɪskɒntɪˈnjuːɪtɪnɪsɪz/ | n. |不连续性；间断性| The function exhibits several discontinuousnesses.  这个函数表现出几个不连续点。|  近义词: gaps, breaks, interruptions | 反义词: continuities, connections | 词性: 名词

词源:  From discontinuous + -ness.  Discontinuous itself comes from the prefix dis- (not) + continuous (forming a continuous whole). Continuous ultimately derives from Latin continuus.
