aerotaxis:/ˌɛəroʊˈtæksɪs/| n.|趋气性；向空气性|The movement of an organism, such as a bacterium, toward or away from a higher or lower concentration of oxygen in the air is called aerotaxis.|Example 1: The bacteria exhibited positive aerotaxis, moving towards the oxygen source. 这些细菌表现出正趋气性，向氧气源移动。

Example 2: Certain bacteria demonstrate negative aerotaxis, moving away from oxygen.某些细菌表现出负趋气性，远离氧气。|近义词:aerotropism|反义词: (No direct antonym, but negative aerotaxis describes movement away from air/oxygen) |词性:noun
