foliages:  This is not a standard English word.  While grammatically possible as a plural, it's rarely used.  It would refer to the leaves of multiple individual plants, or perhaps different types of foliage.  It's more natural to use "foliage" in a singular sense even when referring to multiple plants.  For example, "The foliage of the trees in the park was vibrant." is preferred to "The foliages of the trees in the park were vibrant." |词性: considered a non-standard plural noun
