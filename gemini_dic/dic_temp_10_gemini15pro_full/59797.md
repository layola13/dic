注意事项:

"ecoute" itself is primarily used in French. While it might be understood in an English context, especially in musical or artistic circles, it's not common. Its direct English equivalent is "listen".  The verb form in French is "écouter".  I have provided conjugations based on how a native English speaker might attempt to conjugate it if borrowing it directly, but this is not standard English.
