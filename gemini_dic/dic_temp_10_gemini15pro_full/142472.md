oshios:/ˈoʊʃioʊz/ | n. |  押送,押解; 護送; 伴隨|  Escorting, accompanying, conveying under guard. It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism, possibly derived from the word "usher," meaning to guide or escort someone. | There are no established examples of "oshios" used in a standard English sentence as it is likely non-standard.  For demonstrative purposes, considering a similar meaning to "escort", one could construct: "The security team oshios the VIP to the car." (The security team escorted the VIP to the car.) | 近义词: escort, convoy, accompany, usher | 反义词: abandon, desert | 词性: Noun (likely, based on inferred usage)
