electromagnet:/ɪˈlektrəʊˌmæɡnət/ (British) /ɪˈlektrəʊˌmæɡnɪt/ (American)| n.|电磁铁|A magnet consisting of a coil of insulated wire wrapped around a core of soft iron that becomes magnetized when an electric current is passed through the wire.|The crane used a powerful electromagnet to lift the scrap metal. 起重机用强力电磁铁吊起废金属。|近义词:magnet|反义词:non-magnet|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From electro- + magnet.  "Electro-" comes from the Greek "ēlektron" meaning amber (which exhibits static electricity). "Magnet" ultimately derives from the Greek "Magnes lithos" meaning "Magnesian stone", referring to lodestone found in Magnesia, a region of ancient Greece.
