词源:  "Bebleed" appears to be a non-standard intensification of the verb "bleed," formed by adding the prefix "be-."  While "be-" can be a prefix in English (e.g., "besmirch," "befriend"), it's not typically used to create intensifying forms of verbs related to physical states like bleeding.  The standard way to express excessive bleeding is to use adverbs like "profusely" or "heavily" or verbs like "hemorrhage."
