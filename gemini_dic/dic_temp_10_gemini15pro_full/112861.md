Etymology:
From Middle English *lukkes*, plural of *lukke* (“luck, fortune, happiness, chance”), from Middle Dutch *gheluc* (“happiness, fortune, luck”), from Proto-Germanic *lak* (“gift of fortune; pleasant happening”), which may be related to Proto-Germanic *lēgaz* (“to lie down, lay”).  The plural form *lucks* is now considered nonstandard or archaic, with "luck" typically used in both singular and plural contexts.
