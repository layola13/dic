注意事项:
"Haut" is more common in French than in English.  While understood in English-speaking contexts related to fashion and cuisine, its usage outside these areas might sound affected or pretentious.  Using synonyms like "posh," "upscale," or "high-end" might be more natural in everyday English conversation.
