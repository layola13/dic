词源:
The etymology of "cockamamie" is uncertain.  One theory suggests it may be related to "decalcomania," a process of transferring images.  Another connects it to a dialectical word for a rooster, implying something nonsensical or "cock-and-bull story"-like.  A third possibility links it to a Scottish word meaning "whimsical" or "fantastic."  Regardless of its precise origin, the word's meaning of "ridiculous" or "implausible" is well-established.
