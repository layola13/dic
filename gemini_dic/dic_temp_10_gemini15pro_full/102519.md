注意事项:

The word "jaculation" can refer to both a physiological process and the ejection of seeds in plants.  It's important to consider the context to determine the intended meaning.  While "ejaculation" is a more common term for the physiological process in humans, "jaculation" is sometimes used, especially in older or more technical texts.  Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, care should be taken when using this word.
