ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of the word "hoodoo" is uncertain, but it's likely connected to African American folk magic traditions.  In this context, a hoodoo can refer to a spell or charm.  Geologically, the term might be related to this sense of the word, suggesting the rock formations inspire awe and a sense of mystery.  Another theory suggests a link to the Blackfoot word "hoodoo" meaning "evil spirit".
