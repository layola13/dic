注意事项:
"nai" (哪) is more common in spoken Chinese than in written Chinese, where "na yi ge" (哪一个 - which one) or "na yi xie" (哪些 - which ones) are often preferred for clarity.  While some dictionaries might list "nai" as an adjective, its function is closer to that of an interrogative pronoun.  It doesn't describe a noun like a typical adjective; rather, it stands in place of a noun phrase to form a question.  Therefore, classifying it as a pronoun is more accurate.
