Etymology:
From enslaved + -ness.  "Enslaved" comes from the verb "enslave," which means to make someone a slave.  "Enslave" in turn comes from the prefix "en-" (meaning "to cause to be") and the word "slave." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "enslaved" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being enslaved.
