注意事项:

"palsy's" is not a commonly used word.  The word "palsy" itself is usually sufficient and doesn't require the possessive form in most contexts.  It's generally more natural to rephrase sentences to avoid using "palsy's." For example, instead of "The palsy's effects were devastating," it's better to say "The effects of the palsy were devastating."
