PHRASE->

(Due to the extremely limited usage of "Irelands," there are no established common phrases.)


注意事项:  The word "Irelands" is grammatically unusual and rarely used in English. It generally appears only in highly specific contexts, such as mythology or fantasy, where the concept of multiple versions of Ireland is relevant. In almost all other cases, "Ireland" is the correct and appropriate term.
