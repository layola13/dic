They are benthic feeders, meaning they primarily eat organisms found on or near the seabed. |Example 1: The researchers observed a mousefish scavenging on the ocean floor. 研究人员观察到一条鼠鱼在海底觅食。

Example 2: The mousefish uses its sensitive snout to locate prey hidden in the sediment. 鼠鱼用它敏感的鼻子来定位隐藏在沉积物中的猎物。|近义词：ratfish, chimaera (for some species due to similar appearance), benthic fish|反义词: pelagic fish (fish living in open water, contrasting with benthic)|词性:noun
