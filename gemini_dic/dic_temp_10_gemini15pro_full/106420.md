注意事项:
*  While "korans" is grammatically correct as the plural of "Koran," "Qur'ans" or "Qurans" is generally preferred, especially in religious contexts.  Using "korans" might be perceived as less respectful.
* The word "Koran" itself is an older transliteration and "Quran" is now the more common and preferred spelling.
