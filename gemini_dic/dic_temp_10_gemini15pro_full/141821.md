orbitosphenoid: /ˌɔːrbɪtoʊˈsfēnɔɪd/ | n. | 蝶骨眼眶部 |  The orbitosphenoid is a paired bone in the skull of many vertebrates, contributing to the formation of the orbit (eye socket). | The orbitosphenoid bone is small and located behind the eye. 蝶骨眼眶部很小，位于眼睛后方。| The delicate orbitosphenoid can be easily damaged during fossil excavation.  在化石挖掘过程中，脆弱的蝶骨眼眶部很容易受损。 | synonyms:  presphenoid (in some classifications),  | antonyms: N/A | noun


Etymology:
From 'orbito-' (relating to the orbit) + 'sphenoid' (wedge-shaped bone).  Ultimately from Latin 'orbita' (track, course) and Greek 'sphēn' (wedge) + '-oeides' (resembling).
