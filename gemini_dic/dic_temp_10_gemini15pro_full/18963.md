good: /ɡʊd/ | adj. | 好的 | having desirable or positive qualities especially those suitable for a thing specified | This is a good book. 这是一本好书。 | excellent, fine, superior | bad, poor, awful | adjective

good:/ɡʊd/ | n. | 好处；善行 | something that is good |  He always tries to do good. 他总是努力做好事。 | benefit, advantage, merit | bad, evil, harm | noun

Etymology: From Middle English good, god, from Old English gōd (“good, virtuous, desirable; valid; kind, friendly; considerable; competent”), from Proto-Germanic *gōdaz (“good, fit, suitable”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰedʰ- (“to unite, be associated, suitable”). 

(Note: The verb and adverbial forms of "good" are typically "do well" and "well," respectively, rather than "good."  While "good" can sometimes be used adverbially in informal speech, it's generally considered incorrect in formal writing.)


Since {bestgood} is not a valid word, the above provides separate analyses for "best" and "good".  There's no combined etymology, usage examples, or phrases for a non-existent word.
