"Betso" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "bets," "best," or another word.  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A slang term:** It could be a slang word used within a specific community or region, or online.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name, place, or brand.
* **A newly coined word:**  While less likely, it's possible it's a very recent addition to the language.


Since "betso" isn't a standard word, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you can provide more context or clarify the intended word, I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.

For example, if you meant "bets," I can offer the following:

bet:/bet/ | n. v. | 打赌，赌注；下注 | An agreement that something will happen | He placed a bet on the horse race. 他在赛马上下了赌注。 |  wager, gamble | abstain | noun, verb
bet:/bet/ | n. v. | 打赌，赌注；下注 |  The act of gambling money on an outcome |  I bet you $20 that it will rain tomorrow. 我跟你赌20美元明天会下雨。| wager, gamble | abstain | noun, verb
