注意事项:

"Mein" is not standard English. It's a dialectal or humorous variant of "my," primarily used to represent a stereotypical German accent or for comedic effect.  In standard English, always use "my."  Therefore, providing synonyms, antonyms, and usage examples in a formal context isn't entirely applicable. This response focuses on showcasing its usage as it would appear in informal settings.
