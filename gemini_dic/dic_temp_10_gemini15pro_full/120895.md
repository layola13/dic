Etymology:  From mis- (meaning "wrong" or "bad") + calculate. The prefix "mis-" comes from Old French "mes-" from a Germanic source akin to Old High German "miss-" (wrong, astray). "Calculate" comes from Latin "calculus" (pebble, small stone used in reckoning).  So, "miscalculate" literally means "to reckon wrongly".
