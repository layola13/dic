PHRASE->
gigabit's Ethernet = 千兆位以太网
gigabit's network = 千兆位网络
gigabit's connection = 千兆位连接
gigabit's speed = 千兆位速度
gigabit's internet = 千兆位互联网

注意事项：

严格来说，"gigabit's" 不是一个标准的英文单词。 "gigabit" 本身就是一个名词，表示数据传输速率的单位。后面加 's 构成所有格，虽然在口语中偶尔出现，但在正式写作中应避免使用。 建议使用 "gigabit" 或 "Gbps"。  例如： "gigabit Ethernet," "gigabit network," "gigabit connection," "gigabit speeds," "gigabit internet."
