PHRASE->
  Not commonly used in phrases.  This word is typically used on its own to describe the manner in which something is done.  It's difficult to create natural-sounding phrases with it.  For example, phrases like "parapsychologically speaking" or "in a parapsychological manner" are grammatically correct but sound awkward and are rarely used.  It's better to incorporate the word directly into the sentence as an adverb modifying the verb, as shown in the examples above.
