PHRASE->

This word doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way English pronouns do.  It's primarily used grammatically as the object of a verb.  It's important to note that "mich" is dialectal and less formal than standard German.  While you might hear phrases involving "mich" in spoken dialects, they are not set phrases in the same way "What's up?" is in English.
