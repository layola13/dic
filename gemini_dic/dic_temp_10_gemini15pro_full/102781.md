japhetic:/dʒəˈfɛtɪk/
adjective
雅弗的；雅弗语系的
Relating to Japheth, one of the sons of Noah in the Bible, or his descendants, traditionally considered to be the ancestors of the Indo-European peoples.
The Japhetic languages, according to this traditional view, would include Indo-European languages.
The term "Japhetic" is now largely outdated and considered inaccurate in linguistics and anthropology.  More modern terms and classifications are used to describe language families and human populations.
近义词: Indo-European (in older, outdated usage)
反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it's a classification, not a quality)
