词源：
The origin of "mosh" is uncertain, but it's believed to have originated in the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene in the early 1980s.  "Mosha" is a later variant, possibly influenced by the similar-sounding word "mosh" and its association with aggressive dancing.  Some sources suggest it's a corruption of "mash," reflecting the chaotic nature of the dance.
