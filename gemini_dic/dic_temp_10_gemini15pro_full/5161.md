ETYMOLOGY->
From allergenic + -ity.  "Allergenic" comes from "allergy" + "-genic". "Allergy" is derived from the Greek words "allos" (other, different) and "ergon" (work, reaction).  "-genic" comes from the Greek "-genes" (born, produced). "-ity" is a suffix used to form nouns indicating a state or quality.
