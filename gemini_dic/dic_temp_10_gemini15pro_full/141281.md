etymology->
"Opeidoscope" is a blend of "ope" (an archaic word meaning "opening" or "aperture") and "kaleidoscope."  While not a standard dictionary entry, it's a creatively formed word that evokes the image of a kaleidoscope.  "Kaleidoscope" itself comes from the Greek words "kalos" (beautiful), "eidos" (form), and "skopeō" (to see).
