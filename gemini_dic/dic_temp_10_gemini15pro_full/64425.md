ergodic:/ɜːˈɡɒdɪk/ | adj. | 各态遍历的；遍历性的 | Relating to or denoting systems or processes with the property that, given sufficient time, they include or impinge on all parts of the space of possible states, and that any observation or measurement made of the system will reflect the overall properties of the system rather than properties of a specific portion. | The physicist explained the ergodic hypothesis, stating that over a long period, a system's time average is equivalent to its ensemble average. 物理学家解释了各态遍历假说，指出在很长一段时间内，系统的时均值与其系综平均值相等。| The data collected from the ergodic process showed a consistent pattern. 从遍历性过程中收集的数据显示出一致的模式。 |  synonymous: stochastic, random, probabilistic | antonymous: deterministic, predictable | adjective
