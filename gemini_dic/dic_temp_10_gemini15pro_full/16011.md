ETYMOLOGY->
From French *banalité*, from *banal* "belonging to a manor; common, commonplace," from Old French *ban* "proclamation, jurisdiction, territory subject to a ban," from Frankish *ban* "proclamation, order." The original sense was of a feudal lord's right to certain services from his tenants. This sense broadened to "commonplace" because things available to all within a manor were, by definition, commonplace.
