Etymology:
From Middle English *kitten, *kitoun, *kitling, from Old Norse *ketlingr (compare Icelandic kettlingur (“kitten”)), *kitt (“kitten”), diminutive of Old Norse köttr (“cat”), from Proto-Germanic *kattuz (“cat”) (compare West Frisian kat (“cat”), Dutch kat (“cat”), German Katze (“cat”)), from Late Latin cattus (“cat”) (compare Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian gatto (“cat”)), probably borrowed from a Berber language (compare Nubian *kadiz (“wildcat”)).
