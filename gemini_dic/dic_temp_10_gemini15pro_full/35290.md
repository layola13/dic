词源：From Middle English *climben, *climen, from Old English climban (“to climb, mount, ascend”), from Proto-Germanic *klembaną (“to climb, press, pinch”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)klembh- (“to press together, hold fast”). Cognate with Dutch klimmen (“to climb”), German klimmen (“to climb”), Swedish klämma (“to pinch, squeeze”).

注意事项：虽然clym看起来像climb的古体拼写，但在现代英语中，climb才是标准拼写。clym很少使用。
