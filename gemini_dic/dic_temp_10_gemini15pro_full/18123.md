词源: From Middle English *behne, from Old English *bēne (“bee”), which is ultimately from Proto-Germanic *bēnō (“bee”).  The word later shifted in meaning to refer to a woman, particularly a maidservant or female slave, likely due to associations with industriousness or subservience. This semantic shift is unusual and the exact reasons are not fully clear.  It is now largely archaic or used in historical contexts.
