From Latin *ad cum (meaning "to now, up to now").  It's related to the Latin word "cum" meaning "with, together with."  The *ad cum evolved into the single word "acum."

注意事项:

"Acum" is a less common and somewhat formal or literary word, especially in modern English.  While it is understood,  "so far," "until now," "hitherto," or simply "now" are more frequently used in everyday conversation and writing.  It is more common in legal or academic contexts where precision in expressing time up to a specific point is important.
