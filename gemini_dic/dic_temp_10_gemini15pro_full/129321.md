**词源:**

"Noing" is likely a non-standard or dialectal variation of "knowing," derived from the Old English verb "cnawan" (to know).  It's not recognized as a standard English word in most dictionaries.  It might be used informally or in certain regional dialects.


**注意事项:**  As "noing" isn't a standard English word, its use might be considered incorrect in formal writing or speech.  Using "knowing" is generally recommended.
