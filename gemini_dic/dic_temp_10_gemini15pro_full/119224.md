miargyrite:/maɪˈɑːrdʒɪˌraɪt/
noun|硫银锑矿|A dark red to black mineral, a silver antimony sulfide, AgSbS2, occurring in monoclinic crystals.|Miargyrite is a relatively rare silver ore mineral.|近义词: pyrargyrite, proustite|反义词: None|词性:n.

Etymology:
From Greek *mios* (lesser, smaller) + *argyros* (silver) + *-ite* (suffix forming names of minerals).  The name alludes to its lower silver content compared to pyrargyrite.
