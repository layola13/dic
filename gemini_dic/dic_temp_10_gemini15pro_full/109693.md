leukoplast:/ˈluːkəˌplæst/
noun
白色体；白色体；造血细胞
A colorless organelle found in plant cells, used for the storage of starch or oil.  Specifically, a plastid, such as an amyloplast or elaioplast, that does not contain pigments.  Sometimes used loosely to refer to any plastid.
Leukoplasts are primarily involved in the storage of starches, lipids, and proteins.
近义词: amyloplast, elaioplast
反义词: chromoplast, chloroplast
词性:n.

Etymology:
From German Leukoplast, from leuko- + -plast.  Leuko- comes from Greek leukos "white". -plast comes from Greek plastos "formed, molded".
