词源：
From Middle English *ladybridde, *levedybyrde, from Old English lēohtfugel (“glowworm”), equivalent to lady +‎ bird.  The "lady" refers to the Virgin Mary, and the beetle's bright colours were associated with her cloak.  Later, the word bird was substituted for fly, and the name changed to ladybird, ladybug (US), or lady beetle.
