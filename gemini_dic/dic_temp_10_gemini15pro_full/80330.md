Etymology:
From "gold" + "-er" (suffix forming nouns denoting agents or persons engaged in an activity). "Gold" comes from Old English "gold," from Proto-Germanic "gulþa-" (bright, shining, yellow), related to Old Norse "gull" and Latin "aurum." The "-er" suffix is a common Germanic agentive suffix, as in "baker," "singer," "teacher."
