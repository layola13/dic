nonlinearity:/ˌnɒnˌlɪnɪˈærɪti/ | n. |非线性，非线性关系|The quality or state of being nonlinear.  A relationship between two quantities in which a change in one quantity is not accompanied by a proportional change in the other.|The system exhibits strong nonlinearity.|Synonyms: curvature, deviation from linearity|Antonyms: linearity|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + linearity.  Linearity from late Middle English: from medieval Latin linearitas, from Latin linearis ‘of a line’, from linea ‘line’.
