注意事项:
词源：From Arrernte *altjiranga 'dreaming'


Since "dreamtimes" is not a standard English word (the correct term is "Dreamtime" and it's usually singular), phrases related to it are less common.  It's more about understanding its cultural context and usage within discussions about Aboriginal Australian beliefs and traditions.
