*Note: The word "orthodonticses" is not a standard English word. The correct singular form is "orthodontics" and it functions as a mass noun, thus doesn't typically have a plural form.  If referring to multiple instances of orthodontic treatment or practice, one might use phrases like "different types of orthodontics" or "various orthodontic treatments." *
