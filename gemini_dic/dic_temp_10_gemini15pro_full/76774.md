词源:
From Middle English *gamster*, from Old English *gamenestre* (“female player, prostitute”), equivalent to *gamen* (“game”) + *-estre* (feminine suffix, cognate with German *-ster*).  The male form *gamenere* also existed in Old English, but died out. The sense shifted over time to refer specifically to gambling.
