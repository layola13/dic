ETYMOLOGY->
From mylo- + -hyoid.  Mylo- comes from Greek *múlē* meaning "millstone," referring to the molar teeth, and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *melə- * meaning "to grind."  -hyoid refers to the hyoid bone, from Greek *hyoeidēs* meaning "shaped like the letter upsilon (υ)," from *hyoeis* (the upsilon-shaped hyoid bone).
