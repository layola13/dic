USAGE->

"Ammunition" is an uncountable noun (mass noun) and generally doesn't have a plural form.  While "ammunitions" can sometimes be encountered, especially in older texts or when referring to distinct types of ammunition, modern usage overwhelmingly favors "ammunition" in both singular and plural contexts.  It's generally considered more correct to use "ammunition" even when talking about multiple types.
