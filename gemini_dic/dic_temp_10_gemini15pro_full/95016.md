注意事项:  While grammatically correct, the possessive form "inability's" is uncommon and often sounds awkward.  It's usually better to rephrase using "the inability of" or a possessive pronoun (his/her/their inability). For example, instead of "His inability's impact..." use "The impact of his inability..." or "His inability impacted..."
