microaneurysm: /ˌmaɪkroʊˈænjuˌrɪzəm/ | n. | 微动脉瘤 | A tiny aneurysm, usually affecting small blood vessels in the eye, such as those in the retina.  It is often an early sign of diabetic retinopathy. |  Example 1: The ophthalmologist detected microaneurysms during the eye exam, suggesting early diabetic retinopathy. 眼科医生在眼科检查中发现了微动脉瘤，提示早期糖尿病视网膜病变。

Example 2:  Microaneurysms can leak fluid into the retina, causing swelling and blurred vision. 微动脉瘤会将液体渗漏到视网膜中，导致肿胀和视力模糊。 | Synonym:  capillary aneurysm | Antonym:  N/A (No direct antonym for a specific medical condition) | noun
