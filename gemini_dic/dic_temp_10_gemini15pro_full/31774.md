词源:  check + book. "Check" in this context originates from the Old French "eschec" meaning "check, defeat, chessboard," ultimately from the Persian "shah" meaning "king." It evolved to refer to a written order for payment. "Book" comes from the Old English "bōc" referring to a written or printed work.
