gastrula:/ˈɡæstrʊlə/ | n. | 原肠胚 | An early multicellular embryo, typically a hollow cup-shaped structure having three layers of cells. |  The gastrula stage is crucial for the development of the digestive system. 原肠胚阶段对消化系统的发育至关重要。

 The formation of the gastrula marks a significant step in embryogenesis. 原肠胚的形成标志着胚胎发生过程中的一个重要步骤。 | 近义词: embryo (in a specific stage) | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps earlier stages like blastula or later stages like neurula) | 词性: noun
