ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *antimonium, perhaps a scribal error for Arabic ithmid "antimony" or Greek stimmi, stem of stibi "antimony glance, antimony sulfide."  The native etymology anti-monachos "monk's bane," because many early alchemists were monks (and antimony is poisonous), is now discounted.
