nonrepeater:/ˌnɑːnriˈpiːtər/ | n. | 非重复字符；非重复项；不重复者 |  A character or item that appears only once in a sequence.  | The algorithm identified the nonrepeaters in the string.  该算法识别了字符串中的非重复字符。| unique item, single instance | repeated item, duplicate | noun

Etymology:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "repeater" (from "repeat," from Old French "repeeter," from Latin "repetere" - to seek again, attack again, repeat).
