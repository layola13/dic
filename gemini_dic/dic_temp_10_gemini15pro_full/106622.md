PHRASE->
(Since "kuma" is a single noun borrowed from Japanese, it doesn't typically form set phrases in English like English words do.  It's more likely to be used within a sentence describing a bear.)  Therefore, offering general phrases about bears instead of "kuma" specifically:

watch out for bears = 小心熊
bear in mind = 记住
bear hug = 热情的拥抱
bear market = 熊市 (股市低迷时期)
grizzly bear = 灰熊
