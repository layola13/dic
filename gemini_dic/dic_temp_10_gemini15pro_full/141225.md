oospore:/ˈoʊ.əˌspɔːr/ | n. | 卵孢子 | A thick-walled sexual spore that develops from a fertilized oosphere in some algae and fungi. | Example 1: The oospore remains dormant until favorable conditions arise for germination. 卵孢子保持休眠状态，直到出现有利于萌发的条件。

Example 2:  The researchers studied the formation of oospores in the Phytophthora species. 研究人员研究了疫霉菌属中卵孢子的形成。 | Synonym: zygospore, resting spore | Antonym: zoospore (motile spore) | Noun
