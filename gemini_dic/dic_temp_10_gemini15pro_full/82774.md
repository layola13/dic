词源:  While "guilor" appears to resemble words related to guilt, there's no established etymology for it in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure/archaic term.  "Guile," meaning deceitful cunning, comes from Old French "guile," ultimately from Germanic roots.  Given the context, it seems the intended word is a variant or misspelling of "guiler," an archaic or dialectal term for "deceiver" or "cheat."  This likely stems from "guile" + "-er" (agent suffix).


注意事项:

"guilor" is not a standard English word. The correct and more common term is "guiler" (though even this is somewhat archaic).  For modern usage, "cheat," "fraudster," "swindler," or "con artist" are preferred.
