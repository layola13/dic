gneissosity:/naɪˈsɒsɪti/ | n. | 片麻岩化，片麻状构造 | The degree to which a rock exhibits gneissic texture, characterized by alternating light and dark bands of minerals.  指岩石呈现片麻岩结构的程度，其特征是矿物明暗交替的条带。 | The gneissosity of the rock sample was clearly visible.  岩石样品的片麻状构造清晰可见。| synonyms: foliation, banding | antonyms: homogeneity, isotropy | noun

gneissosity:/naɪˈsɒsɪti/ | n. | 片麻结构 | The parallel arrangement of platy minerals in a metamorphic rock, giving it a banded appearance. 变质岩中片状矿物平行排列，使其呈现带状外观。| The intense heat and pressure resulted in a pronounced gneissosity. 强烈的热量和压力导致了明显的片麻结构。| synonyms:  gneissic texture, schistosity | antonyms:  massive texture, non-foliated texture | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From German *gneissigkeit*, from Gneis (“gneiss”) +‎ -igkeit. Ultimately from Old High German gneisto (“sparkling”, in reference to the appearance of gneiss).
