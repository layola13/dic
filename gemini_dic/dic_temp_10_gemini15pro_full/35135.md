ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *clud (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *kludą (“rock, hill, lump”), from Proto-Indo-European *glewd- (“ball, clod”). Cognate with Dutch kluit (“clod, lump”), German Klotz (“block, log”), dialectal German Klott (“rock”), Old Norse klǫð (“burden, difficulty”). The semantic development from “rock, hill” to “cloud” likely occurred due to the perceived similarity in shape.
