词源:  The origin of the word "mariachi" is debated. One theory suggests it derives from the French word "mariage" (marriage), referring to the music's association with weddings during the French occupation of Mexico.  However, this theory is generally discounted by etymologists.  The most accepted theory suggests an indigenous origin, possibly from the Coca language of Jalisco, Mexico.
