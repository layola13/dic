gap-junctional:/ɡæpˈdʒʌŋkʃənəl/ | adj. |间隙连接的| Relating to or involving gap junctions, which are specialized intercellular connections between a multitude of animal cell-types. These junctions directly connect the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between cells. | Gap-junctional communication is crucial for cardiac muscle synchronization. 心肌同步依赖于间隙连接通讯。 | synonymous: intercellular, connexin-mediated | antonymous: non-junctional | adjective

gap-junctional:/ɡæpˈdʒʌŋkʃənəl/ | n. |间隙连接蛋白|A protein that forms gap junctions. | Connexin 43 is a gap-junctional protein found in the heart.  连接蛋白43是一种在心脏中发现的间隙连接蛋白。| synonymous: connexin | antonymous:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "blocking agent" if referring to a substance that inhibits gap junctions) | noun
