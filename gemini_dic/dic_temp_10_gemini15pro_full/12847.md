associativities:/əˌsoʊʃiˈeɪtɪvɪtiz/ | n. |结合性；结合律|The property of an operation whereby the grouping of the operands does not affect the result.  This is typically expressed for a binary operation * as (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).| The associativity of addition allows us to add numbers in any order. 加法的结合律允许我们以任何顺序相加数字。|Associativity is crucial in many areas of mathematics. 结合律在数学的许多领域都至关重要。| 近义词:combinability | 反义词: N/A | 词性:noun
