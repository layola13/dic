ETYMOLOGY->
"Cross-" comes from the Old English "cros" and ultimately from the Latin "crux," meaning "cross" or "stake."  "Trainer" comes from the verb "train," which comes from the Old French "trainer," meaning "to drag, draw, or pull."  The combined term "cross-trainer" refers to a machine that trains multiple muscle groups across the body, or to the act of training in multiple disciplines.
