ETYMOLOGY->
From Old Italian *ad unqua, from Latin ad + unquam ("ever").  It literally meant "to ever," which evolved to mean "up to now," and finally "therefore."

USAGE->

Formal/Literary Usage:
Adunque, as we have seen, the situation is complex. = 因此，正如我们所见，情况很复杂。
The evidence, adunque, points to a different conclusion. = 因此，证据指向了不同的结论。


PHRASE->
While "adunque" doesn't typically form set phrases, it can be used in conjunction with other conjunctive adverbs:
e adunque = and therefore/so
ma adunque = but therefore/so
però adunque = but yet therefore/so/nonetheless


注意事项:

"Adunque" is not commonly used in modern Italian conversation.  It has a more formal or literary tone and might sound archaic or affected in everyday speech.  Using "quindi," "dunque," "pertanto," or simply "so" would be more natural in most situations.
