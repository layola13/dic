The word "nerre" doesn't appear to be a valid English word. It might be a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a slang term, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I can't provide a standard lexical analysis for it.

If you could provide more context, like where you encountered this word or what you think it might mean, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a misspelling, what word did you intend to type?


Since I can't analyze "nerre," I'll demonstrate the requested format using the word "what" as an example:

what: /wɒt/ (British), /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | used to ask for information about something; used to express surprise or disbelief |

例句：
What is your name? = 你叫什么名字？

What do you want for dinner? = 你晚餐想吃什么？


近义词: which, how
反义词: N/A (Interrogative words typically don't have antonyms)
词性: pronoun, determiner, adverb
