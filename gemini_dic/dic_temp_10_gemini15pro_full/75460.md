PHRASE->
(Due to the specialized nature of the word "frumentation", common phrases are unlikely.  It's more likely to see it used in technical descriptions or historical contexts related to grain supply or early forms of fermentation.)


注意事项:
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English. The preferred term is "fermentation."  While technically referring to the fermentation of grain specifically, it's almost always better to use the more common and understood "fermentation".
