indiglucin:/ɪndɪˈɡluːsɪn/ | n. |靛蓝葡萄糖苷; 靛玉红葡萄糖苷 | A glucoside of indigotin or indirubin.  It refers to a class of compounds found in plants, notably *Isatis tinctoria* (woad), which are precursors to the blue dye indigo. Upon hydrolysis, they release the aglycone, which then oxidizes and dimerizes to form indigo. | Indiglucin is a key component in the traditional production of indigo dye.  靛蓝葡萄糖苷是传统靛蓝染料生产中的关键成分。|  Synonym: indican (often used interchangeably, although indican specifically refers to the glucoside of indoxyl) | Antonym: N/A | noun
