myography: /maɪˈɒɡrəfi/ | n. | 肌动描记术；肌电描记法 | The process of recording the activity of muscles.  It refers to methods of recording the mechanical activity of muscles, such as changes in force or length.  Sometimes it is used (incorrectly) as a synonym for electromyography (EMG). | Myography was used to study the effects of the new drug on muscle contractions. 肌动描记术被用来研究这种新药对肌肉收缩的影响。|  Synonym: electromyography (often used interchangeably, though not strictly accurate) | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider techniques that study other physiological processes, like electroencephalography for brain activity) | noun
