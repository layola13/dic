*Note:* "malawis" is not a standard English word. While it's used colloquially among aquarium enthusiasts to refer to Lake Malawi cichlids, the singular "malawi" referring to the fish or the country is more grammatically correct.  The plural of the fish would typically be "malawi cichlids".  I've provided entries for both "malawis" (as requested) and the more standard "malawi."
