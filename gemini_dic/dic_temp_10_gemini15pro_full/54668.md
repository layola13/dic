PHRASE->
(No common phrases exist using "disobliging" specifically.  It's generally used on its own as an adjective.)


词源:
From dis- + obliging, from oblige + -ing.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of". "Oblige" comes from the Old French obliger, and ultimately from the Latin obligare "to bind, obligate".  Therefore, "disobliging" literally means "not obliging" or "not willing to bind oneself to help."
