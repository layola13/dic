Etymology: flea + market + -er

"flea market" dates back to the late 19th/early 20th century.  It's thought to be a translation of the French marché aux puces ("market of the fleas"), referring to the possibility of second-hand goods being infested with fleas.  "-er" is a common suffix denoting a person who performs an action or is associated with a thing.
