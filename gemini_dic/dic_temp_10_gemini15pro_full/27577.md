ETYMOLOGY->
From French *canapé*, literally "sofa," from Old Provençal *canape*, from Late Latin *conopeum* "mosquito net," from Greek *kōnōpeion* "mosquito net, canopy over a bed," from *kōnōps* "gnat, mosquito."  The culinary sense developed because the toppings were thought to resemble something resting on a sofa.
