ETYMOLOGY->
From the late Middle English *imposen*, meaning "to lay on, inflict," derived from the Old French *imposer*, and ultimately from the Latin *imponere*  (in + ponere, "to place upon"). The adjectival form developed later, emphasizing the effect of something being "placed upon" the observer's senses, thus creating a strong impression.
