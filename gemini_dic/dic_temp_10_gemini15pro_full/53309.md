Etymology:
From dis- (expressing negation, lack) + able + -ed. The prefix "dis-" comes from Latin, meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," "utterly," or having a privative, negative, or reversing force. "Able" comes from Old French "hable," ultimately from Latin "habilis," meaning "easy to handle, manageable, skillful."
