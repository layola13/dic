ETYMOLOGY->
Shortened form of *advertisements*, from *advertise* (verb), which comes from Middle French *advertir* "to warn, inform," from Latin *advertere* "to turn toward," from *ad-* "to" + *vertere* "to turn." The sense evolution is from "to turn one's attention to" to "to inform" and finally "to promote."
