Etymology:

From "over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi, meaning "above, beyond") + "devotedness" (from "devoted," past participle of "devote," from Late Latin devotare "to vow, dedicate," from Latin devotus "vowed, devoted," past participle of devovere "to vow," from de- "down" + vovere "to vow").  Therefore, the word literally implies a devotion that is "beyond" or "excessive."
