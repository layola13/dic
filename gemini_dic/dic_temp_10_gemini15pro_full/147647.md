词源：
"Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much."
"Politically" is an adverb derived from the adjective "political," which relates to the activities associated with the governance of a country or area.
Therefore, "overpolitically" combines these elements to signify an excessive or inappropriate focus on politics.
