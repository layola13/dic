ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *accedence*, from Old French *accidens*, from Latin *accidens* (“happening, befalling; a chance, accident; grammar: accident”), present active participle of *accidō* (“happen, befall”), from *ad-* (“to, towards”) + *cadō* (“fall”).  The grammatical sense arose from the notion of grammatical properties as accidental (as opposed to essential) to a word.

USAGE->
There are limited examples of "accedences" in modern usage, as it's an archaic term. Most contemporary grammar discussions use "inflections" or specific terms like "conjugations" (for verbs) and "declensions" (for nouns and adjectives).  Here are some examples adapted for its archaic usage:


The grammarian meticulously documented the accedences of the ancient language. = 语法学家一丝不苟地记录了这门古代语言的词形变化。

The student struggled to master the numerous accedences of Latin verbs. = 学生努力掌握拉丁语动词的众多词形变化。



PHRASE->
Due to its archaic nature, "accedences" doesn't have common phrases associated with it.  More modern equivalents would use "inflections" or other related terms.


注意事项:
The word "accedences" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  "Inflections," "conjugations," and "declensions" are preferred.
