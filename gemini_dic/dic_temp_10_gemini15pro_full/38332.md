词性:adjective

词源:
From con+ceit+less.  "Conceit" comes from Old French "conceit," meaning "concept, thought, opinion," ultimately from Latin "concipere" meaning "to take in, conceive." The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something. Therefore, "conceitless" literally means "without conceit."
