ETYMOLOGY->
From ought (verb) + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality).  The word "ought" itself has a complex history, ultimately deriving from Old English *āhte, the past tense of āgan "to own, possess, owe."  The sense of moral obligation developed over time from the idea of owing a debt or duty.
