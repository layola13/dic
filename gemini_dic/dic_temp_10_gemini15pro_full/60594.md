"elber" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a person's name or place), or a word from a specialized field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if you meant "elder," here's the analysis:

elder: /ˈeldər/ | n. adj. |长者，年长者；资格较老的 | A person who is older than you, especially someone who deserves respect because of their age and experience.  |  My elder sister is a doctor. 我的姐姐是一位医生。| synonyms: senior, older, superior | antonyms: younger, junior | noun, adjective

elder: /ˈeldər/ | n. adj. | 长老 | A senior member of a church or other religious group.  | The church elders met to discuss the issue. 教会长老们开会讨论这个问题。 | synonyms: senior, leader | antonyms:  junior, follower | noun, adjective
