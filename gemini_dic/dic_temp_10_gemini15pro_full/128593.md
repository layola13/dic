PHRASE->
(Not applicable.  "Niceness's" is not typically used in common phrases.)


词源：From "niceness,"  ultimately from "nice" (13th century, meaning "foolish, simple"), evolving through various meanings including "coy, shy," "fastidious, refined," to its modern sense of "pleasant, agreeable."  The "-'s" indicates the possessive form, although its usage with an abstract noun like "niceness" is somewhat unusual and might be considered informal or even non-standard in some contexts.  It's more natural and common to simply use "niceness" without the possessive.
