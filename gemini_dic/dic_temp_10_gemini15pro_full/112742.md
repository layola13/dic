注意事项:  The original prompt requested a breakdown of "{ls's}". This appears to be a typo and was interpreted as "what's else".  Since "what's" and "else" function separately, they have been analyzed individually.  The usage examples focus on "what" as it's the more grammatically complex element.  The pronunciation provided for "what's" includes both weak and strong forms.
