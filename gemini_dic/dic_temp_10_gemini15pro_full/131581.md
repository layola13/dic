PHRASE->
(This word is not typically used in common phrases.  It's more commonly used in technical contexts describing system behavior.)


词源:  non- (not) + compatible + -ly (adverbial suffix).  "Compatible" comes from Late Latin "compatibilis," meaning "suffering together," from Latin "com-" (together) + "pati" (to suffer).  The meaning evolved to "able to exist together without conflict."
