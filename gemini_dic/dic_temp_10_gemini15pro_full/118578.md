mesostate:/ˈmɛzəʊsteɪt/ | n. | 中间态，介稳态 | A state of a system that is intermediate between two other states, especially a relatively stable intermediate state of a protein or other macromolecule.  A mesostate is often a transient or metastable state. | The protein folds through a series of mesostates before reaching its final stable conformation. 蛋白质在达到最终稳定构象之前会经历一系列中间态。 | intermediate, transition state | stable state | noun
