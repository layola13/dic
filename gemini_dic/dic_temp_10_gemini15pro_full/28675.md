ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cariōsitās, from Latin cariōsus (“rotten, decayed”), from cariēs (“rottenness, decay”).  While the connection between "decay" and "curiosity" seems odd, it may relate to the idea of "gnawing" or a "consuming desire" to know something.  It's important to note that there is some debate about this etymology, and some sources suggest a possible connection to "care." However, the derivation from "cariōsus" is generally considered the most likely.
