词源:  "De-" is a prefix meaning "to remove" or "opposite of," and "beige" refers to a pale sandy fawn color. Therefore, "debeige" literally means to remove the beige color. This word is relatively new and likely arose in the late 20th or early 21st century, reflecting a trend towards more vibrant and less neutral color palettes in design and fashion.
