ETYMOLOGY->
From accustomed + -ly.  Accustomed itself comes from the past participle of the verb accustom, from Old French acostumer, ultimately from Latin consuescere "to accustom," from con- "together" + suescere "to become used to."

USAGE->
This word is less common than its synonyms and is often seen in more formal or literary contexts.

Example 1:
He accustomedly rose early, a habit he had maintained for years. = 他习惯早起，这个习惯他保持了多年。

Example 2:
Accustomedly, she would take a walk in the park after dinner. = 她习惯在晚饭后去公园散步。

PHRASE->
While "accustomedly" doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way as more common adverbs, it can be used with a range of prepositional phrases to indicate the context of the habit:

1. accustomedly in the morning = 通常在早上
2. accustomedly before breakfast = 通常在早餐前
3. accustomedly after work = 通常下班后
4. accustomedly on weekends = 通常在周末
5. accustomedly during the summer = 通常在夏天
