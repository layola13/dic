"lius" is not a recognized English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. It's possible this is a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name), a technical term specific to a certain field, or a word from another language. If you can provide more context, I may be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the request emphasizes examples for the word "what," I can provide that information.
