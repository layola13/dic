ETYMOLOGY->
From French *pastille*, from Italian *pastiglia*, from Late Latin *pastillus* (“small loaf”), diminutive of Latin *panis* (“bread”).  The word originally referred to small loaves or rolls of bread, and later came to mean small tablets, especially those used for medication or fragrance. The sense of "colored crayon" likely arose from the resemblance of these crayons to the small, often brightly colored lozenges.
