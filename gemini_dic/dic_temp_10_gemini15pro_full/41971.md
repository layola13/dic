ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "cosset," which originated in the 16th century.  "Cosset" comes from the Middle English word "cosset," referring to a lamb brought up by hand, often in the farmhouse.  The nurturing connotations of hand-rearing a lamb transferred to the idea of pampering and overprotecting a person.
