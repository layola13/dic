isoallele:/ˈaɪsoʊəˌlil/ | n. |同种等位基因|An allele that produces the same phenotype as another allele at the same locus, even though the two alleles may have different DNA sequences. | Example 1:  The two isoalleles at this locus both result in red flower color. 这两个位于同一基因座的同种等位基因都导致了红色的花朵。

Example 2:  Although they are isoalleles, further analysis revealed subtle differences in their expression levels. 尽管它们是同种等位基因，进一步的分析揭示了它们在表达水平上的细微差异。|Synonym: equivalent allele|Antonym:  (No direct antonym, but could consider contrasting terms like "different allele" or "allele with distinct phenotype")|noun
