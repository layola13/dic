The word "ingri" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered the word, I might be able to help.

Since I can't analyze "ingri," I'll use the word "what" as a demonstration of the requested format.
