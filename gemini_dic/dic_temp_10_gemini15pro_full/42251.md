ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *contenance "bearing, demeanor, appearance," from contenir "to contain, hold," from Latin continere "to hold together, enclose, contain," from com- "together" + tenere "to hold."  The sense shifted from the general "bearing, demeanor" to refer specifically to the face and its expression.
