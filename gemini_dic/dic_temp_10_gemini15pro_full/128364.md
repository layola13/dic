neutrons:/ˈnjuːtrɒnz/ (UK), /ˈnuːtrɑːnz/ (US)| n. |中子|A subatomic particle of about the same mass as a proton but without an electric charge, present in all atomic nuclei except those of ordinary hydrogen.|The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons.|近义词: nucleon (a proton or neutron, especially in the nucleus of an atom)|反义词: proton (because it carries a positive charge, the opposite of a neutron's neutral charge), electron (because it carries a negative charge)|词性: noun

Etymology: From neutral + -on (suffix used in forming names of subatomic particles).  "Neutral" ultimately comes from Latin neuter, meaning "neither."
