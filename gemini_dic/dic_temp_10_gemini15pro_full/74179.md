ETYMOLOGY->
"four" + "stroke"
"four" from Old English *feower, from Proto-Germanic *fewur, from Proto-Indo-European *kwetwor-.
"stroke" from Old English strācian "to rub gently, stroke," from Proto-Germanic *straikijan "to stroke, rub," from Proto-Indo-European *(s)treig- "to rub, stroke, touch lightly."  The mechanical sense of "single movement from one extreme to the other" is from the 1580s.
