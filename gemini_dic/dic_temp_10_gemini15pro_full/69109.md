Etymology:
From Portuguese *favela*, originally the name of a plant (*Cnidoscolus quercifolius*) that grew on Providence Hill in Rio de Janeiro, where the first favela was established.  Soldiers who had fought in the Canudos War were granted land on this hill, which became known as Morro da Favela.  The name was then extended to other similar settlements.
