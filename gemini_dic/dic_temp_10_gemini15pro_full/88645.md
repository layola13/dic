词源：The etymology of "hoagie" is uncertain. One popular theory connects it to the Hog Island shipyard in Philadelphia, where workers during World War I were called "hoggies" and ate large sandwiches. Another theory links it to the Italian word "onza," meaning "ounce," perhaps referring to the amount of meat on the sandwich.
