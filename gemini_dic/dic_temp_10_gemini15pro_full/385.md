近义词: inorganic, non-biological, non-living
反义词: biogenic, biological, living
词性: adjective

词源:
From a- (not) + bio- (life) + -genous (producing).  The prefix "a-" signifies negation, "bio-" refers to life, and "-genous" means producing or generating. Thus, "abiogenous" literally means "not life-producing".
