The word "engles" isn't a recognized English word.  It's possible there's a typo, and you meant "angles" or "angels."  I'll provide information for both:

**Angel:**

/ˈeɪndʒəl/ | n. | 天使，守护神，善人| A spiritual being believed to act as an attendant, agent, or messenger of God, conventionally represented in human form with wings and a long robe. Also, a kind or helpful person. |  She looked like an angel in her white dress. 她穿着白裙子，看起来像个天使。 | synonyms: seraph, cherub, saint | antonyms: devil, demon | noun
