gyrators:/ˈdʒaɪˌreɪtərz/| n.|旋转器，回旋器|A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port electrical network element proposed in 1948 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer. Unlike the ideal transformer, a gyrator is non-reciprocal.  |Gyrators are frequently used to simulate inductors using capacitors.|近义词:circulators|反义词:|noun
