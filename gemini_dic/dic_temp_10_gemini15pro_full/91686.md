hypercomposite:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɒmpəzɪt/ | adj. | 超复合的 |  A hypercomposite number is a positive integer which has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.  It is a stronger condition than being highly composite. | 12 is a hypercomposite number because it has six divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) and no smaller number has more. | 近义词: highly composite | 反义词: prime | 词性: 形容词
