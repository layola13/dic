词源:
From Middle English *elidir, probably from Old French *elidor (unattested), a place name of unknown origin, perhaps related to Old Breton *elit, "hind, deer" + Old Breton *dor, "door, gate".  The modern usage is largely influenced by the children's fantasy novel "Elidor" by Alan Garner, published in 1965.
