词源：
The origin of "faff" is uncertain, but it's thought to be related to Scots words like "faffle" (to flap or flutter) and "fuffle" (to bustle or fuss).  The word gained popularity in British English in the late 20th century. “faff”的起源不确定，但它被认为与苏格兰语“faffle”（拍打或飘动）和“fuffle”（忙碌或大惊小怪）有关。这个词在20世纪后期在英国英语中流行起来。
