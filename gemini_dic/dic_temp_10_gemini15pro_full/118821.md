metanephridial:/ˌmɛtəˈnɛfrɪdiəl/
adjective
后肾的
Relating to or denoting metanephridia, a type of excretory tubule found in many invertebrates, including annelids, mollusks, and arthropods.  These tubules typically have an internal opening (nephrostome) that collects coelomic fluid and an external opening (nephridiopore) that discharges waste.
Metanephridia are more complex than protonephridia and are typically associated with a blood supply.
例句：Metanephridial tubules are characteristic of annelids. 后肾管是环节动物的特征。

例句：The metanephridial system plays a crucial role in osmoregulation. 后肾系统在渗透调节中起着至关重要的作用。
近义词：nephridial
反义词：(None - this is a specific anatomical term)
词性：adjective
