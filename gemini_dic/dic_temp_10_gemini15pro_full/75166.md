词源:  "Fritzing-out" is a colloquial term likely derived from "fritz," meaning to break down or malfunction. The origin of "fritz" is uncertain, possibly related to the German name "Fritz," which was sometimes used as a generic term for a German soldier during World War I.  Adding "-ing out" emphasizes the ongoing or erratic nature of the malfunction.
