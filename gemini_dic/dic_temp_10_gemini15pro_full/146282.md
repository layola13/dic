Etymology:
From over- + fanciful + -ness.  "Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much". "Fanciful" comes from "fancy," which in turn derives from the Old French "fantasie," ultimately from the Greek "phantasia" meaning "appearance," "imagination." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "fanciful" into the noun "fancifulness," denoting the state or quality of being fanciful.  The plural "-es" is added to indicate multiple instances of this quality.
