paragonite:/ˈpærəɡəˌnaɪt/
n.| 副对闪石，钠云母|A common phyllosilicate mineral with the chemical formula NaAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2. It is a member of the mica group and is typically found in metamorphic rocks. |Paragonite is often found in schists. 副对闪石经常出现在片岩中。|
Synonyms: sodium mica, natron-glimmer|
Antonyms: muscovite (in some geological contexts, as they represent different pressure-temperature conditions)|
词性: noun
