PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically form strong collocations or phrases.  It's generally used on its own to modify a verb or adjective.)


Due to the nature of the word, common phrases are not applicable. It is an adverb that describes a lack of exceptionality, making fixed phrases less likely.  However, one could construct examples like: "He performed nonexceptionally well," which simply means his performance was good but not outstanding.  Providing five examples of this structure would be repetitive and not demonstrate common usage.
