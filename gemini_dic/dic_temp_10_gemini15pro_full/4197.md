airfoils: /ˈɛərfɔɪlz/ | n. | 机翼，翼型 |A surface, such as a wing, propeller blade, or rudder, whose shape and orientation control stability, direction, lift, thrust, or propulsion. | The airplane's airfoils were designed for maximum lift.  飞机的机翼是为了获得最大的升力而设计的。| synonyms: wings, blades, vanes, aerofoils | antonyms: N/A | noun

Etymology: From aero- + foil, influenced by the earlier term "aerofoil." "Aero-" comes from Greek "aēr" (air), and "foil" ultimately comes from Latin "folium" (leaf).
