ETYMOLOGY->
From French flamboyant, present participle of flamboyer "to blaze, flame," from Old French flamboiant "flaming, blazing," from flambe "flame" (see flame (n.)). Originally applied to the late Gothic architectural style characterized by wavy or flame-like tracery. The sense of "showy, ostentatious" developed later, likely influenced by the visual impression of the brightly colored flowers of the flamboyant tree.
