注意事项:  (This section is not requested in the prompt but included for completeness)
While *init* is commonly used as a verb (and occasionally a noun referring to the initial value), it's important to remember it's shortened slang.  In formal writing, using the full word "initialize" is often preferred.  Also, the adjective form, referring to something that is initial, is spelled "initial," not "init."
