ETYMOLOGY->
From French *désireux* ("desirous") + *-less* (suffix indicating lack or absence).  The French *désireux* comes from Old French *desiros*, from Latin *dēsīderāre* (“to long for, desire”), from *dē-* (“from, down from”) + *sīderāre* (related to *sīdus*, *sideris* "star, constellation").  The original sense might have been "to feel the absence of the stars," implying a sense of loss and longing. The suffix *-less* is of Germanic origin.
