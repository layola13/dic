archaea:/ɑːrˈkiːə/ /ɑːrˈkiːə/
n.
古细菌，古生菌
A domain of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.
Archaea are found in extreme environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes.  古细菌存在于极端环境中，例如温泉和盐湖。
Archaea were initially classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated.  古细菌最初被归类为细菌，被称为古细菌（在古细菌界中），但这种分类已经过时了。

近义词：archaebacteria (outdated)
反义词: (No direct antonym, as it's a biological classification)
