It is an abbreviation, not a single word. It has no direct English equivalent as a single word, but refers to a concept that exists in most countries. It is only used in the context of Italian taxes.  It doesn't have typical verb, adjective, or adverb forms, nor synonyms/antonyms in the same way "ripe" does.
