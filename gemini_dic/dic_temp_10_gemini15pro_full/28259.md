ETYMOLOGY->
From the noun "caption" + "-ed". "Caption" comes from the Latin "captio" meaning "a taking, seizing," from "capere" meaning "to take, seize."  The meaning evolved to refer to the heading or title of a document and later to a descriptive title or explanation for an illustration or photograph.
