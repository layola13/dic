amil:/ˈæmɪl/ | n. | amyl,戊基 | An alkyl radical, C5H11, of the paraffin series, of which several isomeric forms are known. | The chemist analyzed the compound and found it contained an amil group. 化学家分析了这种化合物，发现它含有戊基。 | 近义词: pentyl | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

词源: From French *amyle*, from Latin *amylum* (“starch”) + *-yl* (“radical”), because amyl alcohol was originally obtained from starch.  最终源自希腊语 *ámylon* (淀粉)。
