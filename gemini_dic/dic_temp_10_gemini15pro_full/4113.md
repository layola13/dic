The word "ainad" does not exist in the English language.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a word from another language. If you can provide more context or correct the spelling, I can try to help.


If you're interested in learning about the word "what" instead,  here's the analysis:

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv.| 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？|  Example: What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！ | Synonyms: which, how | Antonyms: N/A | pronoun, determiner, adverb
