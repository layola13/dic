词源:  From "gaseous" + "-ity" (suffix forming nouns of quality or state). Ultimately from Latin "gas" (probably coined by the Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont).


注意事项: "Gaseity's" is not a standard English word. The correct possessive form of "gaseity" is "gaseity's," but "gaseity" itself is rarely used. "Gaseousness" or simply describing something as "gaseous" is much more common.  The provided examples and phrases are constructed for illustrative purposes based on how the word might be used if it were more common.
