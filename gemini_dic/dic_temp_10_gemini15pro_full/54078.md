ETYMOLOGY->

From Middle English *diseler*,  from Old English *diseldra*, a comparative adjective meaning "older, more advanced in years", from *dīs* ("this") + *ieldra* ("older").  The usage shifted from an adjective to a noun over time.  *Yldra* is related to Old High German *altiro*, Old Norse *ellri*, and Gothic *alpiza*, all from Proto-Germanic *aldizô* ("older").  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂elt- ("grow, nourish").
