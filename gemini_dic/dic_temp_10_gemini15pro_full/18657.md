Since "beob" isn't a real word, I can't provide accurate information about its etymology or usage.  It's important to use recognized dictionaries and resources to confirm the validity of a word before attempting to analyze it.  If you encountered this word somewhere, please provide context and I can try to help you understand its meaning in that specific situation.  

For example, if it's a typo, I might be able to guess the intended word. If it's from a specific field like gaming or a regional dialect, more information would be needed to analyze it.
