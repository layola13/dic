PHRASE->

(Given that "mas" is a single word itself, and not typically part of standard English phrases, these examples show how it might be used informally):

Quiero mas. = I want more.
Dame mas. = Give me more.
Un poco mas. = A little more.
Mas, por favor. = More, please.
Mas y mas. = More and more.


注意事项:  As noted throughout, the literal use of "mas" is restricted mainly to informal settings or when speaking Spanish. In English, "more" is the standard and preferred term.  Using "mas" figuratively to represent excess or abundance ("eating mas and mas") is more acceptable in informal English.
