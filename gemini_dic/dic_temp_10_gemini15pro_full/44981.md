crystallite:/ˈkrɪstəlaɪt/| n. |微晶，晶粒|A small crystal, typically one of many that make up a larger crystalline structure or a polycrystalline material.  A crystallite is a small or even microscopic crystal which forms, for example, during the cooling of many materials. |The properties of the material are often dominated by the size and orientation of these crystallites.|Synonyms: grain, microcrystal|Antonyms: amorphous (material)|noun
