dexa:/ˈdɛksə/| prefix |十, 十倍|  A prefix meaning "ten," used in the formation of compound words (e.g., decagon).  Derived from Greek *deka "ten". |A decagon has ten sides. 十边形有十条边。|近义词: deca- |反义词: N/A | prefix

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
A dexagram has six points.  六芒星有六个点。(This example uses 'dexa' indirectly within 'hexagram', where 'hexa' also represents six, illustrating potential confusion).
Decameters are used to measure distances.  十米用于测量距离。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Scientists are exploring the properties of dexamethasone. 科学家们正在探索地塞米松的特性。(Dexamethasone contains 'dexa', but the meaning is not directly related to "ten").
We are learning about decimal systems. 我们正在学习十进制系统。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Chemists have synthesized new dextran derivatives.  化学家们已经合成了新的葡聚糖衍生物。(Dextran contains 'dexa', but the meaning is not directly related to "ten").
We have studied the decapod crustaceans. 我们研究过十足目甲壳类动物。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Researchers have been studying the effects of dexamethasone on COVID-19 patients. 研究人员一直在研究地塞米松对COVID-19患者的影响。
They have been working with decadal climate predictions.  他们一直在研究十年气候预测。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The ancient Greeks used a decimal system. 古希腊人使用十进制系统。
He measured the field in decameters. 他用十米测量了这块田地。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
They were discussing the use of dexamethasone in treating inflammation. 他们正在讨论使用地塞米松治疗炎症。
We were learning about decagons in geometry class. 我们在几何课上学习十边形。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Scientists had already synthesized dextran before the war.  科学家们在战前就已经合成了葡聚糖。
They had measured the distance in decameters before realizing their mistake. 他们在意识到错误之前已经用十米测量了距离。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Researchers had been studying dexamethasone for years before its effectiveness against COVID-19 was discovered.  研究人员在发现地塞米松对COVID-19有效之前已经研究了多年。
They had been using the decadal calendar for generations. 他们世世代代都在使用十年日历。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
We will learn more about decimal systems next week.  下周我们将学习更多关于十进制系统的知识。
Scientists will continue to research the uses of dexamethasone. 科学家将继续研究地塞米松的用途。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Next year, we will be studying decagons in greater detail. 明年，我们将更详细地研究十边形。
They will be using dexamethasone in the new treatment protocol. 他们将在新的治疗方案中使用地塞米松。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By next year, we will have learned all about decimal systems. 到明年，我们将学习完所有关于十进制系统的知识。
Scientists will have completed the dexamethasone study by the end of the year.  科学家们将在年底前完成地塞米松的研究。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By the time they finish, they will have been studying dexamethasone for over five years. 到他们完成时，他们将已经研究地塞米松超过五年了。
By the end of the decade, we will have been using the decadal calendar for ten years. 到本世纪末，我们将已经使用十年日历十年了。

PHRASE->
N/A - 'dexa' is a prefix and doesn't typically form stand-alone phrases.  It's primarily used in combination with other word elements to create compound words like decagon, decameter, and in chemical names like dexamethasone and dextran.  These compound words then form their own phrases within sentences, as demonstrated in the examples above.
