hyperdiploidy:/ˌhaɪpərˈdɪplɔɪdi/ | n. | 超二倍体 | The presence of more than two complete sets of chromosomes in a cell, but not a multiple of the haploid number.  It often refers to a condition in cancer cells where there are a few extra chromosomes, not a whole extra set. |  Hyperdiploidy is a common feature of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 超二倍体是儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病的常见特征。|  Aneuploidy, polyploidy | Hypoploidy | noun
