mechanicalnesses:/məˈkænɪkəlnəsəz/
|n.|机械性，机械状态（复数）|The state or quality of being mechanical; the characteristics of a machine or mechanism.  This word is rarely used, and its plural form is even rarer. |Due to the inherent mechanicalnesses of the system, it lacked the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions. 由于系统的固有机械性，它缺乏适应变化条件的灵活性。|Near synonyms: rigidity, inflexibility, stiffness|Antonyms: flexibility, adaptability, fluidity|Noun
