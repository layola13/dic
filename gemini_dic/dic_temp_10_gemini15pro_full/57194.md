ETYMOLOGY->
"Down" has its roots in Old English "dūn," meaning "downward," "from a higher to a lower place." The preposition "on" comes from Old English "on," indicating "on," "upon," or "in contact with." The combination "down-on" likely developed figuratively from the literal sense of being "down upon" someone, suggesting a position of authority or disapproval.
