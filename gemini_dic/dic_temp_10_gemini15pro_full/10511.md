注意事项:

* "Apporter" is a French verb.  While used in English sometimes (particularly in culinary contexts), "bring" is the more common English equivalent.  The above conjugations and examples are in French.  The "Present Perfect Continuous" and "Past Perfect Continuous" do not have direct French equivalents and are generally expressed differently.  Similarly, the "Future Continuous" is usually conveyed by using the simple future and adding a time context.  The French language also tends to avoid the passive voice whenever possible.

* I've provided French examples and their English translations to illustrate the usage in context.  The English translations are not always literal, but convey the intended meaning.
