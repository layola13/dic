nonspiral:/nɒnˈspaɪrəl/ | adj. | 非螺旋形的，不旋绕的 | Not spiral; not shaped like a coil or helix. | The seashells had a nonspiral, conical shape.  这些贝壳呈非螺旋形的圆锥形。| The artist created a nonspiral, linear design.  这位艺术家创作了一个非螺旋的线性设计。 | 近义词: straight, linear | 反义词: spiral, helical | 词性: adjective

词源:  "non-" (Latin prefix meaning "not") + "spiral" (from Latin "spira," meaning "coil, twist").  由拉丁语前缀“non-”（意为“不”）和“spiral”（源自拉丁语“spira”，意为“线圈，扭曲”）组成。
