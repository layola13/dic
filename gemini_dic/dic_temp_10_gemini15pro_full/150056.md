注意事项:

This word is not commonly used outside of specialized scientific contexts.  Therefore, many phrases and examples might sound contrived. The word itself is likely a modern scientific coinage rather than having a deep etymological history.  The root "palpo" relates to the palpus, and "-cil" likely suggests a resemblance to cilia, although palpi are not cilia.
