"over-" (prefix) + "honest" (adjective)
"over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, beyond, across."
"honest" comes from Old French "honeste," ultimately from Latin "honestus," meaning "honorable, respectable."  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning of "honest," indicating an excess of honesty.
