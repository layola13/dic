词源:  "Chivachie" is likely a variant of "chivvy" or "chivy," which means to tease or harass playfully.  The meaning seems to have softened over time to simply indicate lighthearted conversation.  Its origins are uncertain, possibly related to the Romany word "chive," meaning "knife." However, the connection between "knife" and "light conversation" is unclear.  The word is primarily used in informal contexts.
