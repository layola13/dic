词源：moolah comes from the American slang term "moola," which originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. Its exact origin is uncertain, but it's thought to be possibly influenced by the Hindi word "mūl," meaning "root" or "origin," perhaps referring to the root of all wealth.  Another theory suggests a connection to the French word "moula," meaning "mold" or "matrix," possibly referring to the mold used to make coins.
