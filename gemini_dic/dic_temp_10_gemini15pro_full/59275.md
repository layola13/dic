PHRASE->
While phrases with "eagerness's" are grammatically possible, they are highly unusual and generally avoided.  It's more natural to rephrase. For example, instead of "The boy's eagerness's for candy was evident," it's better to say "The boy's eagerness for candy was evident" or "The boy was clearly eager for candy."  Thus, providing phrases with "eagerness's" is not practical or helpful.

词源：
From Middle English *egernesse*, from Old French *egre*, from Latin *acer* "sharp, keen."

注意事项：
Using "eagerness's" is generally awkward and should be avoided.  Rephrasing is almost always preferable. It is very rare to encounter this double possessive form in natural English.
