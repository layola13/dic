Etymology: From Greek *brontē* ("thunder") + *sauros* ("lizard").  Originally named *Brontosaurus excelsus* by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879, it was later reclassified as *Apatosaurus excelsus* because *Apatosaurus* was named first and the two were considered the same genus.  However, more recent research (2015) suggests that *Brontosaurus* may be a distinct genus after all.
