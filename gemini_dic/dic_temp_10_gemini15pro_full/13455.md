The word "atrenne" doesn't appear to be a standard English word.  It's possible there's a typo, or it might be a very obscure or archaic term, a technical term in a specific field, or even a proper noun.  If you could provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word), I might be able to offer more assistance.
