femtosecond:/ˈfemtoʊˌsekənd/ | n. |飞秒|A unit of time equal to one quadrillionth of a second (10^-15 second).|The laser pulse lasted only a few femtoseconds.|Synonyms: None (as it's a specific unit)|Antonyms: None (as it's a specific unit)|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From femto- (prefix denoting 10^-15) + second.  "Femto-" comes from Danish/Norwegian *femten, meaning "fifteen."  This refers to the fifteen decimal places to the right of zero in the decimal representation of a femtosecond (0.000000000000001 seconds).
