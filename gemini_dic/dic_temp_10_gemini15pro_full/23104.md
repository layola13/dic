ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *bouquet "thicket, grove," diminutive of bosc "wood," from Frankish *bosk- (source also of Old High German busc "bush, thicket"), from Proto-Germanic *buskaz "bush" (source also of Old English bysc "bush"), from PIE *bhus- "to grow, sprout." The sense evolution is from "bush" to "cluster, bunch" (of flowers), then by extension to the aroma of wine.
