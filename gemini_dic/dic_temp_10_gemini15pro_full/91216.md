A reduced form of bilirubin produced by the action of intestinal bacteria.  It is colorless and is further converted into urobilinogen.
Example: The presence of hydrobilirubin in the stool contributes to its characteristic brown color.  粪便中氢胆红素的存在导致了其特有的棕色。
Example:  Hydrobilirubin is formed in the gut from conjugated bilirubin. 氢胆红素是由结合胆红素在肠道中形成的。
