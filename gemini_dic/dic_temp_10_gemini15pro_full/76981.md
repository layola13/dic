gardai:/ˈɡɑːrdiː/| n.|警察（爱尔兰语，相当于英语中的police）|The Gardaí are investigating the incident. 爱尔兰警察正在调查这起事件。|近义词：police, officers|反义词:criminals|名词

词源:
From Irish *gardaí*, plural of *garda* (“guard”), from Old Irish *garda* (“protection, guard, keeping”), from Proto-Celtic *wergā* (“to do, make”). Cognate with Welsh *gwarchod* (“to guard, protect”).

用法说明:
Gardaí is the plural form of Garda, which refers to a member of the Garda Síochána, the police force of the Republic of Ireland.  It's important to note that "Gardaí" is already plural; you wouldn't say "Gardais".  You can use "Garda" to refer to an individual officer, and "Gardaí" to refer to the force as a whole, or multiple officers.
