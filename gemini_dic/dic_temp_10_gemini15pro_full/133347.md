nonextensively:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnsɪvli/ | adv. | 非广延地 |  Not extensively; in a way that does not extend widely or comprehensively.  It refers to systems where the whole is not simply the sum of its parts, a concept often used in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. | The properties of the system behaved nonextensively due to the long-range interactions between particles.  该系统的性质由于粒子间的长程相互作用而表现出非广延性。| Near synonyms: non-additively, non-linearly | Antonyms: extensively, additively | word type: adverb
