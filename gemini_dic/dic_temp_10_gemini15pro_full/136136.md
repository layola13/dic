nonreflectors:/ˌnɑːnɹɪˈflɛktərz/ | n. | 非反射体，不反射光线的物体 | Objects that do not reflect light. |  The walls of the anechoic chamber were covered in nonreflectors to absorb sound waves.  消音室的墙壁上覆盖着非反射材料以吸收声波。 |  non-reflecting surfaces, opaque materials | reflectors, mirrors | noun


Etymology:

non- (prefix): from Latin *non "not"
reflect (verb): from Latin reflectere "to bend back," from re- "back" + flectere "to bend"
-or (suffix): forms nouns denoting a person or thing that performs the action of the verb, from Latin -or.
