词源:  "buss" (kiss) comes from Middle English *bussen*, probably of imitative origin. "buss" (vehicle) is a shortening of "omnibus," from Latin *omnibus* "for all," dative plural of *omnis* "all."  The meaning "to transport by bus" and "the act of transporting by bus" are derived from the noun form of "bus" (vehicle). The restaurant sense of "bussing" tables originated in the US.
