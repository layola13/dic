词源:  From out + of + humor.  "Out of humor" originally referred to being out of one's usual temperament or disposition, with "humor" meaning one's prevailing mood or state of mind.  This meaning of "humor" dates back to the ancient Greek theory of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile), which were believed to influence personality and health.
