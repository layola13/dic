ETYMOLOGY->

From Cockney + -fication (suffix forming nouns of action or process). Cockney itself has uncertain origins, but one theory connects it to "cock's egg," a malformed or inferior egg, perhaps metaphorically applied to city dwellers perceived as effete by rural populations.  -fication is related to the Latin facere, "to make" or "to do."
