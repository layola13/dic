ETYMOLOGY->
From ad- (to) + -ex (out, from).  Ultimately from Latin "addere" (to add).  The specific form "addex" appears to be a less common variant or misspelling of "add," possibly influenced by words like "annex" or "index."  While "addex" might be found in some older texts or dialects, "add" is the standard and preferred form in modern English.
