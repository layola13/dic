注意事项:
As mentioned repeatedly, "mathes" is not standard English.  While occasionally used informally, particularly in some British dialects, "maths" (British English) or "math" (American English) are the preferred and recommended spellings.  Using the correct spelling will improve clarity and avoid potential misunderstandings.  All examples above using "mathes" should ideally be replaced with "maths" or "math" depending on your preferred regional variant.
