nonviscidness:/ˌnɒnvɪˈskɪdnəs/ | n. | 无粘性; 不粘稠 | The nonviscidness of the liquid allowed it to flow easily through the narrow tube. |  The nonviscidness of the fluid is crucial for this experiment.  这种液体的无粘性使其很容易流过狭窄的管道。 | 近义词: fluidity, slipperiness, inviscidity | 反义词: viscosity, stickiness, viscidity | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From "non-" (not) + "viscid" (sticky, glutinous) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality). "Viscid" comes from Latin "viscidus," from "viscum" (birdlime, mistletoe).
