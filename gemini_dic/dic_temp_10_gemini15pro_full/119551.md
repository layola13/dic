microspore:/ˈmaɪkrəˌspɔːr/| n. |小孢子|A small spore, typically haploid, that develops into a male gametophyte in seed plants.|The microspores are released from the microsporangium. 小孢子从小孢子囊中释放出来。|Microspores develop into pollen grains. 小孢子发育成花粉粒。| 近义词: pollen grain (in the context of seed plants)| 反义词: megaspore| noun

ETYMOLOGY->
