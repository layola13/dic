The word "barus" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a technical term specific to a certain field, a proper noun, or a word from a different language.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.

If you meant "barous", which is also not a standard English word, it might be a variant spelling of "barose," though even this is uncommon. The closest recognizable word is "barus" which appears in some specific scientific contexts (e.g., related to the physicist Carl Barus), but is not a common word with a standard definition.
