词源:  This word is a neologism formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "etherealness".  "Ethereal" comes from the Greek "aithēr" meaning "upper air" or "sky," later associated with the heavens.  Therefore, "nonetherealness" represents the opposite of being airy, heavenly, or spiritual; it signifies something grounded, tangible, and real.
