词源：
From Scots *gowk, from Old Norse gaukr, from Proto-Germanic *gaukaz, from Proto-Indo-European *gēwk-. Cognate with Old English gēac.  Related to cuckoo.  Originally referring to the cuckoo, the word later acquired the meaning of "fool" or "simpleton," perhaps because of the cuckoo's habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests.
