词源:  The origin of "buggered" is uncertain, but it's likely related to the Middle English word "bougre," meaning "sodomite," derived ultimately from the Bulgar people. Over time, the word lost its original meaning and became a general term of abuse and then a euphemism.  Its connection to damage or exhaustion likely arose from association with being “worn out” or “used up.”  It remains a relatively taboo word, considered vulgar in formal contexts.
