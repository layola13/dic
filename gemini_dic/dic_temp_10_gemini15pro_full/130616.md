nonadiabatic:/ˌnɒnˌeɪdiəˈbætɪk/ | adj. | 非绝热的 |  Relating to or denoting a process in which the system does not remain in the same quantum state throughout.  In simpler terms, it refers to a change occurring too rapidly for a system to maintain thermal equilibrium. |  The nonadiabatic transition between electronic states plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions.  非绝热的电子态之间的跃迁在许多化学反应中起着至关重要的作用。| near-adiabatic (approaching adiabatic behavior) | adiabatic | adjective
non-adiabatic:/ˌnɒnˌeɪdiəˈbætɪk/ | adj. | 非绝热的 |  Relating to or denoting a process in which the system does not remain in the same quantum state throughout. In simpler terms, it refers to a change occurring too rapidly for a system to maintain thermal equilibrium. | The non-adiabatic reaction proceeded quickly due to the rapid change in temperature.  由于温度的快速变化，非绝热反应进行得很快。| near-adiabatic | adiabatic | adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From "non-" (not) + "adiabatic". "Adiabatic" comes from Greek "adiabatos," meaning "not passable," from "a-" (not) + "dia-" (through) + "bainein" (to go).
