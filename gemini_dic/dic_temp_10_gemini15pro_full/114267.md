词源:  "mainline" originally referred to the principal vein used for intravenous injection.  The term later broadened to refer to the act of injecting drugs directly into a vein, and then metaphorically to indulging heavily in any activity. "mainline" 最初指的是用于静脉注射的主要静脉。 后来，该词的含义扩展到指将药物直接注射到静脉的行为，然后隐喻为沉迷于任何活动。
