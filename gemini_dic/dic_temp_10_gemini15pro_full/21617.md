ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *blunt*, from Old Norse *bluntr* (“blunt, weak”), from Proto-Germanic *bluntaz* (“dull, blunt”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰel- (“to swell, bloom”). Cognate with Dutch *blunt* (“blunt”), German *blunt* (“damaged, broken”).  The sense development from “dull” to “frank” likely arose from the idea of a direct, unpolished manner of speaking.
