ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *bolt or *bolt, meaning "arrow," "short thick arrow," later "metal pin," from Proto-Germanic *bultaz.  The meaning related to lightning likely developed from the image of a thunderbolt as a projectile. The verb sense "to move suddenly" derives from the sudden release of a bolted object.
