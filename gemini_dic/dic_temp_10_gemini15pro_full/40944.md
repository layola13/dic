Etymology->
From Middle English *coupe*, *cope*, from Old English *cȳpa* (“basket, pail”), from Proto-Germanic *kūpō* (“rounded container”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kewp- (“to bend, curve”). Cognate with Dutch *kuip* (“tub, vat”), German *Kuppel* (“dome, cupola”), *Kuppe* (“top, summit”). The verb sense "to confine" arose from the noun.
