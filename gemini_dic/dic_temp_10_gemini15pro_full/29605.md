PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Categoricalness" is a noun and doesn't typically form set phrases in the same way that more common words like "what" do.


词源：From "categorical" + "-ness". "Categorical" comes from Late Latin "categoricus", from Greek "katēgorikos", from "katēgorein" "to accuse, assert, predicate".
