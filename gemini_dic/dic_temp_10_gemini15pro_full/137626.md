nontuned: /ˌnɒnˈtjuːnd/ (British) /ˌnɑːnˈtuːnd/ (American)| adj.| 未调谐的，未调音的|Not tuned; not adjusted to a particular frequency or pitch. |The nontuned circuit produced a lot of static. 未调谐的电路产生了很多静电干扰。|The radio was nontuned and just picked up static. 这收音机没有调谐，只收到静电噪声。|近义词：untuned, out of tune|反义词: tuned, in tune|词性:形容词

Etymology:
non- + tuned.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "tuned" comes from the verb "tune," which ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic "*tuniz" meaning "melody."
