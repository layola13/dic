nonexpansiveness:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænsɪvnəs/ | n. | 非扩张性 | The state or quality of being nonexpansive, often referring to a function or mapping that does not increase distances between points.  It means that the distance between the images of any two points under the mapping is no greater than the distance between the original two points. | The nonexpansiveness of the projection operator is crucial in this proof.  投影算子的非扩张性在这个证明中至关重要。

The algorithm relies on the nonexpansiveness of the averaging operation.  该算法依赖于平均运算的非扩张性。| 近义词: contractiveness (in some contexts),  | 反义词: expansiveness, dilativeness | noun
