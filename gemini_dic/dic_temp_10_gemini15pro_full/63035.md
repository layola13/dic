词源:
From enraptured + -ly. Enraptured comes from the past participle of enrapture, which means "to fill with delight." Enrapture itself comes from en- (meaning "to cause to be in" or "to put into") and rapture (meaning "ecstasy" or "transport").  Ultimately, the word traces back to Latin *rapere, meaning "to seize or carry off."
