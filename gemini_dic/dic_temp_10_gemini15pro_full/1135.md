ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *accidence*, from Old French *accidens*, from Latin *accidentia*, plural of *accidens* (“a chance occurrence, accident”), from present participle of *accidō* (“happen to, befall”), from *ad* (“to, towards”) + *cadō* (“fall”). Doublet of *accident*.

USAGE->
In modern linguistics, "accidence" is less commonly used than "morphology," which refers to the study of word formation and structure.  However, "accidence" is still occasionally encountered, particularly in older grammar books or in discussions of traditional grammar.

Here are some examples demonstrating its usage in different contexts, though these are contrived as the word itself isn't commonly used in modern English:

Focus on Inflection:

The accidence of Latin verbs is complex. = 拉丁语动词的词形变化很复杂。
Mastering the accidence of German nouns is essential for fluency. = 掌握德语名词的词形变化对于流利运用至关重要。

Contrast with Syntax:

While syntax deals with sentence structure, accidence focuses on individual words. = 语法处理句子结构，而词形变化则关注单个单词。
She understands the accidence but struggles with syntax. = 她理解词形变化，但在句法方面有困难。

In older texts, it might be used more generally to refer to grammar:

He studied English accidence and composition. = 他学习了英语语法和作文。
A good understanding of accidence is essential for clear writing. = 良好的语法理解对于清晰的写作至关重要。

PHRASE->
While "accidence" itself doesn't typically appear in phrases, related phrases pertaining to grammar and morphology might include:

mastering the accidence = 掌握词形变化
