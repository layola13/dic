PHRASE-> (Not commonly used in phrases.  This word is generally used on its own to describe the manner of speaking or writing.)

词源:  From non- + cogently (from cogent + -ly). Cogent comes from Latin *cogentem, present participle of cogere "to compel, collect, bring together," from com- "together" (see com-) + agere "to drive, lead, act" (see act (n.)).
