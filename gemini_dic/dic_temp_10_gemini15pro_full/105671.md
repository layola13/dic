注意事项:
Since "kingo" isn't a standard English word with a widely recognized meaning outside of specific contexts (like the app or game), its usage is limited and largely context-dependent.  The provided examples focus on these known contexts.  Furthermore, antonyms and synonyms are difficult to provide without further context.
