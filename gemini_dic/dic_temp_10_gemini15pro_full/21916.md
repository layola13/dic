词源:  "Bofer" is likely a slang term of uncertain origin. There's no clear etymological record.  It may be a regionalism or a relatively recent coinage.  Its similarity to words like "buffer" (perhaps implying a shield against the truth) and "bluffer" is suggestive, but a definitive link cannot be established.
