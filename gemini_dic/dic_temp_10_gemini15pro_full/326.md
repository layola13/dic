ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *abeance "expectation, gaping," from *abeer "to gape, open wide," from Latin ad "to" + bavere "to open wide."  The original sense was "expectant attention," then "expectation of an heir," which led to the legal meaning of "temporary inactivity of an office, title, etc., pending its devolution to a proper heir or claimant."
