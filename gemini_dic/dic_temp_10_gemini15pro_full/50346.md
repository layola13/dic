depolarization:/ˌdiːpoʊləraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 去极化 |The reduction of the difference in electrical potential across a cell membrane, such as that of a nerve or muscle cell. This occurs when the inside of the cell becomes less negative relative to the outside. | The depolarization of the neuron's membrane triggers the release of neurotransmitters. 神经元细胞膜的去极化触发了神经递质的释放。| Near Synonyms: activation, stimulation | Near Antonyms: repolarization, hyperpolarization | Noun

depolarise:/ˌdiːˈpoʊləraɪz/ | v. | 去极化 | To reduce the difference in electrical potential across a cell membrane. | The drug depolarises the muscle cells, causing them to contract. 这种药物使肌肉细胞去极化，导致它们收缩。| Near Synonyms: activate, stimulate | Near Antonyms: repolarize, hyperpolarize | Verb
