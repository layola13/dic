PHRASE->
(Since "noneclipsed" is a fairly technical term, common phrases are less likely. However, we can construct examples within a scientific context.)
The bond angle in the noneclipsed conformation is wider. 非重叠构象中的键角更宽。
The noneclipsed form is generally more stable due to less steric hindrance. 非重叠形式通常由于空间位阻较小而更稳定。
The energy of the noneclipsed conformer is lower. 非重叠构象异构体的能量较低。
The noneclipsed arrangement of atoms minimizes repulsive interactions. 原子的非重叠排列使排斥相互作用最小化。
The molecule prefers the noneclipsed state to minimize torsional strain. 分子倾向于非重叠状态以最小化扭转应变。


词源: non- + eclipsed.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "eclipsed" refers to being obscured or blocked from view.
