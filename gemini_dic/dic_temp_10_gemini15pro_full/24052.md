词源:  From Greek *bregma (*βρηγμα), meaning "top of the head, forehead," perhaps related to brekhō (*βρηχω), meaning "I roar, bellow." The sense development is likely from the idea of speaking from the top of one's head, without much thought or consideration for other perspectives.  来自希腊语 *bregma (*βρηγμα)，意思是“头顶，额头”，可能与 brekhō (*βρηχω) 相关，意思是“我咆哮，吼叫”。意义的发展可能是从一个人的头顶说话的想法，没有太多思考或考虑其他观点。
