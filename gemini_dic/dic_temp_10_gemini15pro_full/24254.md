注意事项：

"briefing's" itself isn't commonly used. It's more natural to use "of the briefing" instead. For example, instead of "The briefing's key takeaways," it's more common to say "The key takeaways of the briefing."  While grammatically correct, using the possessive form with "briefing" can sound slightly awkward in many contexts.  It's best to consider rephrasing for smoother, more natural English.
