adonization: /ˌædənaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 阳极氧化 | The process of coating a metal (usually aluminum) with a protective oxide layer by making it the anode in an electrolytic cell. | The adonization of the aluminum frame made it more resistant to corrosion.  铝框架的阳极氧化使其更耐腐蚀。| 近义词: anodizing, anodization | 反义词: N/A | 词性: 名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From anode + -ize + -ation.  Anode refers to the positive electrode in electrolysis.  The suffix "-ize" turns it into a verb meaning "to treat or coat by making it an anode," and "-ation" creates the noun form of this verb, referring to the process itself.

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in technical contexts related to materials science, engineering, and manufacturing.

一般现在时:
Adonization protects aluminum from corrosion. = 阳极氧化保护铝免受腐蚀。
The factory adonizes thousands of parts each day. = 工厂每天对数千个零件进行阳极氧化处理。

一般过去时:
The company adonized the metal to improve its durability. =  公司对金属进行了阳极氧化处理以提高其耐用性。
They adonized the surface before painting it. = 他们在油漆之前对表面进行了阳极氧化处理。

现在完成时:
The manufacturer has adonized the components for added protection. = 制造商对组件进行了阳极氧化处理以增强保护。
We have adonized all the aluminum parts in this batch. = 我们已经对这批所有铝制零件进行了阳极氧化处理。

过去完成时:
After they had adonized the aluminum, they applied a sealant. = 在他们对铝进行阳极氧化处理之后，他们涂了一种密封剂。
The parts had been adonized before assembly. = 零件在组装前已经过阳极氧化处理。

将来时:
The engineers will adonize the frame next week. = 工程师们下周将对框架进行阳极氧化处理。
We will adonize the parts to match the desired color. = 我们将对零件进行阳极氧化处理，以匹配所需的顏色。

被动语态:
The aluminum is adonized in a sulfuric acid bath. = 铝在硫酸浴中进行阳极氧化处理。
The parts were adonized to increase their resistance to wear. = 对零件进行了阳极氧化处理，以增加其耐磨性。


PHRASE->
hard adonization = 硬质阳极氧化
color adonization = 彩色阳极氧化
sulfuric acid adonization = 硫酸阳极氧化
adonization process = 阳极氧化工艺
adonization thickness = 阳极氧化膜厚度
