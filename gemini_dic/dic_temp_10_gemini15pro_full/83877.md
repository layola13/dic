"half" comes from Old English "healf," from Proto-Germanic "*halbaz."
"a-" in this context is a reduced form of "on," meaning "on" or "in."  It's related to the Old English prefix "an-." This "a-" becomes part of "afloat" and acts as an intensifier.
"float" comes from Old English "flotian," from Proto-Germanic "*flotan."
