词性: noun

Etymology:
From non- + amenable + -ness.  "Amenable" comes from Old French "amenable," meaning "liable to be brought before a court," from Medieval Latin "aminabilis," from "aminare" "to bring to court," from "a-" (to) + "minare" (to drive, lead). The prefix "non-" simply negates the meaning.
