ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ǣmtig, from Germanic *amtijaz ("leisure, free time"), from Proto-Germanic *amtijaz. Related to Old Norse auðr ("empty, vacant, desolate"), Gothic ամ𐍄𐌹𐍃 (amtis, "leisure, rest"), and German Amt ("office, duty, charge").  The original sense of "at leisure, unemployed" developed to "vacant, unoccupied," and then to the modern meaning of "containing nothing."
