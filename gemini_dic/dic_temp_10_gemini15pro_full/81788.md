ETYMOLOGY->
From French *grenade* "pomegranate," from Old French *granate,* from Medieval Latin *granata* "pomegranate,"  from Latin *granatus* "having many seeds," from *granum* "grain, seed."  The fruit's resemblance to the bomb (in shape and the way it scatters its contents) led to the name transfer.
