ETYMOLOGY->
From *guttersnipe* + *-ish*.  *Guttersnipe* originated in the mid-19th century, referring to a street urchin, particularly one who scavenges in gutters.  It combines *gutter* (a channel at the side of a street for carrying off rainwater) and *snipe* (originally a bird, but later also meaning a worthless or insignificant person). The suffix *-ish* transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating the qualities or characteristics of a guttersnipe.
