PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Loopily" is not commonly used in set phrases.  It's more of a descriptive adverb.


注意事项:

词源:  From loop + -ily.  The adverbial suffix "-ily" is added to the noun "loop," indicating a manner resembling loops or occurring in loops.  This then extends figuratively to describe behavior that is silly, foolish, or eccentric.
