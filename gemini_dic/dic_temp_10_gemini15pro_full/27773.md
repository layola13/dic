ETYMOLOGY->
From cannibal + -ise/-ize.  Ultimately derived from the Carib word *caniba*, meaning "Carib," which was misinterpreted by the Spanish as meaning "man-eater."  The term later broadened to refer to any act of consuming one's own kind, and then metaphorically to the practice described above.
