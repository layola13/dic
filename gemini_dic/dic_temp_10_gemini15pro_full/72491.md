fluorescein:/ˌflʊərəˈsiːɪn/| n.|荧光素|A bright yellow, crystalline, water-soluble dye that becomes intensely fluorescent in alkaline solution. It is used in ophthalmology as a diagnostic aid and in microscopy as a stain.|Example 1: The ophthalmologist used fluorescein to examine the patient's cornea. 眼科医生用荧光素检查病人的角膜。

Example 2: Fluorescein staining revealed a leak in the blood vessels. 荧光素染色显示血管有渗漏。|近义词:dye, stain|反义词:None|词性:noun

Etymology: From fluor- + -escein (chemical suffix indicating a dye or stain derived from a specific substance, in this case, fluorine).  Ultimately from Latin "fluere" (to flow) + "-escent" (becoming).
