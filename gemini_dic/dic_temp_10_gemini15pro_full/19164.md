bewares:/bɪˈwɛəz/
|v.| 提防，小心|This is an archaic form, meaning "be wary of." It is rarely used in modern English.|He bewares the dangers of the forest. 他提防着森林里的危险。|近义词：be wary of, watch out for, guard against|反义词：ignore, disregard|词性:动词

Etymology:
From Middle English *bewarien*, from Old English *bewarian* (“to guard, watch, take heed”), from Proto-Germanic *bewarōną* (“to perceive, observe”).  Cognate with Dutch *bewaken* (“to watch over”), German *bewahren* (“to preserve, protect”).  The -s ending is likely a remnant of an older plural form, though it's treated as singular in modern usage (if used at all).
