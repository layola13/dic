Etymology: From Middle English *giltier, comparative of gilti, from Old English gyltig (“guilty”), from Proto-Germanic *skuldigaz (“guilty, indebted”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kelH- (“to owe, be obliged”).  Cognate with Scots giltie (“guilty”), West Frisian skuldich (“guilty”), Dutch schuldig (“guilty, indebted”), German schuldig (“guilty, indebted”), Swedish skyldig (“guilty, indebted”).  The comparative suffix -er comes from Old English -ra.
