gastrotrocha:/ˈɡæstrəˌtroʊkə/| n. | 腹毛轮虫 |A free-swimming marine larva of certain polychaete worms, characterized by a ciliated band around the middle of the body. | Example 1:  Researchers observed the gastrotrocha larvae swimming near the surface of the water. 研究人员观察到腹毛轮虫幼虫在水面附近游动。

Example 2: The gastrotrocha stage is a crucial part of the polychaete's life cycle. 腹毛轮虫阶段是多毛类环节动物生命周期的一个关键部分。 | 近义词: trochophore larva | 反义词:  (No direct antonym as it's a specific larval stage) | 词性: noun
