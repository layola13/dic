merozoite:/ˈmɛrəˌzoʊˌaɪt/| n. |裂殖子， мерозоит|A stage in the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite, responsible for infecting red blood cells and causing the symptoms of malaria.|The merozoites are released from the liver and invade red blood cells.|近义词: schizont (in a broader sense)|反义词: None (no direct opposite for a specific life stage)|词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *meros* ("part") + *zō(o)-* ("animal") + *-ite* (suffix forming nouns).  Essentially, "a small animal-like part" referring to its stage in the parasitic life cycle.
