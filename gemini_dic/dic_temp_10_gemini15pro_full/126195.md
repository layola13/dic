词源:  From muzz (n.) "liquor strong enough to fuddle one," 1670s, slang or dialectal, possibly from a Scandinavian source (compare Norwegian dialectal mussa "to whisper, mumble," Swedish dialectal mussa "to mumble, to be tipsy").  The original sense of the adjective muzzy (1727) was "tipsy, slightly drunk." The figurative sense of "mentally unclear, confused" is from 1860.
