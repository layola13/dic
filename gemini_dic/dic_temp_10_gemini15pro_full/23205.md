词源:  From Middle English *bour, from Old English būr (“dwelling, chamber, inner room”), from Proto-Germanic *būraz (“dwelling”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰew- (“to exist, dwell”). Cognate with Scots buir (“bower, chamber”), West Frisian boer (“farmhouse”), Dutch boer (“farmer”), German Bauer (“farmer, peasant”), Icelandic búr (“pantry, larder”). More at boor.  The sense "shady recess" is from late Middle English.
