dislikeful:/dɪsˈlaɪkfʊl/ | adj. | 不喜欢的，讨厌的 | Feeling or showing dislike; unpleasant. |  He gave me a dislikeful look. 他给了我一个厌恶的眼神。|  She found his manner dislikeful and offensive. 她觉得他的举止令人讨厌和冒犯。 | 近义词: unpleasant, disagreeable, objectionable, offensive, repugnant | 反义词: pleasant, agreeable, likeable, appealing | 词性: adjective

词源:  From dis- + like + -ful.  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, "like" refers to fondness or preference, and the suffix "-ful" forms adjectives meaning "full of" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "dislikeful" literally means "full of dislike."
