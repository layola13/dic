词源:
From Middle English *lewdely*, from *lewed* (“lay, unlearned, ignorant; vulgar, base”) + *-ly*.  The word *lewed* originally meant "lay" or "unlearned," referring to someone not part of the clergy. Over time, it acquired negative connotations of ignorance, vulgarity, and eventually, sexual impropriety.
