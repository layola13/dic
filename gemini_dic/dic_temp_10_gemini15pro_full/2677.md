ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *geræded, past participle of gerædan "to make ready, prepare, arrange, advise, counsel, decree," from Proto-Germanic *raedjan "to advise, counsel" (source also of Old Saxon giradan, Old Frisian reda, Old Norse reida "to prepare," Gothic garaidjan "to make ready"), from PIE root *reidh- "to ride."  The sense evolution is from "made ready to ride" to "prepared" in general.
