词源:  "noonshun" is a colloquial or informal contraction of "noon shun," where "shun" implies avoiding the heat or activity of the midday sun. It's akin to "sun-shunning". It doesn't have a formal etymology like words with roots in Latin or Greek.  It's a relatively recent term derived from common usage.
