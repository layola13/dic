jurin:/ˈdʒʊərɪn/ | n. | 朱林定律, 尤林定律 | Jurin's law (or sometimes called Jurin's height) is an equation giving the height of a liquid column that will be supported by surface tension inside a capillary tube.  | The Jurin height is dependent on the contact angle of the liquid, the radius of the tube and the surface tension of the liquid.| 近义词: capillary rise, capillary action | 反义词: capillary depression | 词性: noun
