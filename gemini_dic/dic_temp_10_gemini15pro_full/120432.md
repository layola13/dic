ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of "minke" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's a Norwegian whaler's nickname, perhaps for a whale mistaken for a much larger blue whale. Another theory connects it to the German "Minke," a slang term for a small, insignificant person or thing.  "Whale" comes from Old English "hwæl."
