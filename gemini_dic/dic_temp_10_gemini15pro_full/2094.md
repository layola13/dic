ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *adamant (Modern French diamant "diamond"), from Latin adamantem (nominative adamas), from Greek ἀδάμας (adámas) meaning "untamable, invincible, hard steel, diamond," perhaps related to δαμάζω (damázō) "I tame, I subdue".  The noun sense referring to a hard substance predates the adjectival sense of "unyielding."
