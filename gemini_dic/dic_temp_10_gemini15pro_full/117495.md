medullin:/ˌmɛˈdʌlɪn/ | n. | 降钙素基因相关肽;  髓磷脂 | A hormone produced in the kidneys and other tissues that causes vasodilation and lowers blood pressure. | Medullin plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. 降钙素基因相关肽在调节血压方面起着至关重要的作用。 | Medullin levels are often elevated in patients with heart failure. 心力衰竭患者的降钙素基因相关肽水平通常升高。 | Synonyms: adrenomedullin (closely related but not identical) | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as its function is complex;  vasoconstrictors have opposite effects on blood vessels) | noun
