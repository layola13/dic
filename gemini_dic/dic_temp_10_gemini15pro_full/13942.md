注意事项:

*  "Auntliest" is not a standard English word. It is a neologism, likely formed by analogy to words like "friendliest" or "manliest."  While understandable, it would be considered informal and might not be recognized by all speakers.  Using "most aunt-like" would be a more standard alternative.
*  There is no direct antonym for "auntliest."  The suggested antonyms are based on contrasting qualities often associated with the stereotypical image of an aunt.
