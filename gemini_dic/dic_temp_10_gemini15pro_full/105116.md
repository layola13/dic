注意事项：

* "kersin" seems to be a misspelling of "keratin."  This entire response is based on the assumption you meant "keratin."  If you did intend a different word, please clarify.
* There isn't a true opposite of keratin.  It's a specific protein, so the closest antonym would be the absence of keratin or a different structural protein entirely.  I've listed "None" for antonym in this case.
