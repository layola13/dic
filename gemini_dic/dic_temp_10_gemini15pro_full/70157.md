fiaunt:  This word doesn't seem to exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typo, or it's an archaic, dialectal, or invented word.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word), I might be able to provide more information.

Since I can't analyze "fiaunt," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "happen":

happen: /ˈhæpən/ | v. | 发生，出现 | To occur, to take place. | Example:  What happened yesterday? 昨天发生了什么事？

Example: Accidents happen. 事故发生。

近义词: occur, take place, transpire

反义词:  (No single perfect antonym, context-dependent - perhaps "prevent," "avert")

词性: verb
