boltman:/ˈboʊltmən/ | n. | 玻尔兹曼 |  Refers to Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist and philosopher known for his contributions to statistical mechanics.  Specifically, it's often used as shorthand for "Boltzmann constant," a physical constant relating energy at the individual particle level with temperature observable in bulk matter. | The Boltzmann constant is crucial for understanding thermodynamics. 玻尔兹曼常数对于理解热力学至关重要。|  Boltzmann's work revolutionized the field of physics. 玻尔兹曼的工作彻底改变了物理学领域。 | synonym: (none - it's a proper noun referring to a specific person/constant) | antonym: (none - proper nouns generally don't have antonyms) | noun
