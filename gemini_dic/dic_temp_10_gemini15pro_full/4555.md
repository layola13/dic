ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *alkemiste*, from Old French *alquemiste*, from Medieval Latin *alchimista*, from Arabic *al-kīmīyā’* (alchemy) + *-ista* (suffix denoting a person who practices or is skilled in something). The Arabic term ultimately derives from Ancient Greek *khēmeía* (alchemy), possibly from Ancient Egyptian *kmt* (black land, referring to the fertile black soil of the Nile valley, which was associated with chemistry and alchemy).
