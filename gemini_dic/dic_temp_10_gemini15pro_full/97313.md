词源: From Late Middle English *informat, from Latin informāns, present participle of informāre (“to give form to, to train, to instruct, to inform”), from in- (“in, into”) + formāre (“to form”), from forma (“form, shape”).  来自中古英语晚期 *informat，源自拉丁语 informāns，是 informāre（“赋予形式，训练，指导，告知”）的现在分词，来自 in-（“在...内，进入”）+ formāre（“形成”），来自 forma（“形式，形状”）。
