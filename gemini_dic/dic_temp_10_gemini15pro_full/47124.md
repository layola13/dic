词源：From dauntless + -ness + -es (plural marker).  Dauntless itself comes from the Old French *danter (to tame, subdue) and the negative prefix -less.  The plural form "dauntlessnesses" is uncommon, as "dauntlessness" is usually treated as an uncountable noun.  However, it can be used to refer to multiple instances or acts of dauntlessness.
