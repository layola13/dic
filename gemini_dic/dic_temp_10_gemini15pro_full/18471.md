注意事项:

This word is not commonly used in English. It is a direct borrowing from Hungarian and would typically only be used if the speaker is aware of its Hungarian origin and wishes to use it for a specific reason (e.g., in a discussion about Hungarian culture or language). Using it in general English conversation might sound unusual or out of place.  If you want to talk about beliefs or opinions in English, it's generally better to use common English words like "opinion," "view," "belief," or "perspective."
