Etymology->
From Middle English *crennen*, from Old Norse *krenna* (“to notch, indent”), from Proto-Germanic *kranjaną* (“to crane, bend the neck, notch”). Cognate with Danish *krinde* (“to shrink, shrivel”), Swedish *krympa* (“to shrink, shrivel”), Icelandic *krenja* (“to offend, insult”).  The connection likely lies in the image of a shrinking or contracting material developing cracks.
