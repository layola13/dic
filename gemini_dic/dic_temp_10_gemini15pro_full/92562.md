ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin hystericus, from Greek hysterikos “of the womb,” from hystera “womb,” on the notion that hysteria was a female affliction.  The association with the womb reflects ancient beliefs about the wandering womb causing emotional disturbances in women.  Over time, the term has broadened to include similar emotional outbursts in both men and women, losing its direct connection to the original medical theory.
