brachioganoidei: /ˌbrækiˌoʊɡəˈnɔɪdiˌaɪ/
noun
腕鳍鱼纲
An extinct subclass of bony fish characterized by heavily armored bodies and heterocercal tails, prevalent during the Paleozoic and Triassic periods.  They possess unique fin structures and were a significant group in the early evolution of ray-finned fishes.
The Brachioganoidei, though extinct, offer insights into the diversification of early fish.
