ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *haridean*, perhaps from Anglo-Norman *haridelle* (compare Old French *haridelle* (“worn-out horse, jade”)), perhaps ultimately from Frankish *harit* (“army, host”) + *theud* (“people”) (compare Old High German *heri* (“army”) + *diot* (“people”)).  Alternatively, perhaps from a Germanic source akin to Old English *here* (“army”) + *þeoden* (“leader, prince”).
