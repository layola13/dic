macroseismic:/ˌmækrəˈsaɪzmɪk/ | adj. | 大地震的，宏观地震的 | Relating to or based on the observed effects of an earthquake over a large area.  It describes the study of earthquakes based on their large-scale effects, such as damage to buildings and changes in the landscape, rather than on instrumental recordings. | The macroseismic data collected after the earthquake helped determine its epicenter.  宏观地震数据收集在地震发生后有助于确定其震中。| Near Synonyms: megascopic, large-scale | Antonyms: microseismic, small-scale | adjective
