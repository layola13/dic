ETYMOLOGY->
From "dew" + "eyed".  "Dew" refers to the small drops of water that condense on cool surfaces at night, evoking a sense of freshness and purity.  "Eyed" simply means "having eyes".  The combination creates the image of eyes glistening like they are covered in dew, often due to tears brought on by emotion.
