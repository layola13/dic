hypallelomorph:/ˌhaɪpəˈlɛləˌmɔːrf/ | n. |次等位基因，拟等位基因|A gene that produces an effect similar to that of another gene at a different locus, but which interacts with that gene to produce a modified effect when both are present.  It's a less common term than "pseudoallele." |Example: The researchers discovered a hypallelomorph that influences eye color in fruit flies. 研究人员在果蝇身上发现了一种影响眼睛颜色的次等位基因。|Example:  The interaction between the gene and its hypallelomorph resulted in an unexpected phenotype. 基因与其拟等位基因之间的相互作用导致了意想不到的表型。|近义词: pseudoallele, suballele |反义词: N/A |词性: noun
