disappearance's:/ˌdɪsəˈpɪərənsɪz/ | n. | 消失（的名词所有格）|  The possessive form of "disappearance," referring to something belonging to or associated with a disappearance. |  The disappearance's cause remains a mystery.  这起消失的原因仍然是个谜。 | synonyms: vanishing, fading, loss | antonyms: appearance, arrival, emergence | noun

Etymology:
From dis- + appear + -ance + -'s.  "Dis-" is a Latin prefix meaning "apart," "asunder," "away," or having a privative or negative force. "Appear" comes from the Old French "apareir," ultimately from the Latin "apparēre" meaning "to appear." "-ance" is a suffix forming nouns from verbs, and "-'s" is the possessive marker.
