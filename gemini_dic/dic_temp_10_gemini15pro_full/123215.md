monocline:/ˈmɑːnəˌklaɪn/ | n. |单斜层；同斜褶曲|A geological formation in which rock strata are inclined at a uniform angle to the horizontal, forming a single flexure.  A fold in rock strata that slopes in one direction only, forming a gently dipping slope connecting two horizontal or gently sloping surfaces.| The monocline gently dipped towards the valley.  单斜层缓缓地向山谷倾斜。| The geologist pointed out the monocline visible in the cliff face. 地质学家指出了悬崖面上可见的单斜层。|  synonym: homocline | antonym: anticline, syncline | noun
