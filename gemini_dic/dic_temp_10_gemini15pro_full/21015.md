blest:/blest/ | adj. | 幸福的，受祝福的 | Archaic form of blessed, meaning consecrated, holy, or enjoying happiness. |  The blest fields of Elysium. 幸福的极乐世界田野。 | 近义词:blessed, fortunate, lucky | 反义词:cursed, wretched, unhappy | 词性:形容词

词源: From Middle English *`iblest`*, past participle of `blessen`, from Old English `blētsian` "to consecrate by sprinkling with blood, mark with a cross, bless," from Proto-Germanic *`blodison`* "to hallow with blood," from *`blod`* "blood" (see blood (n.)).  The original sense was "sprinkled with the blood of sacrifice." The meaning later shifted to "make sacred, hallow, consecrate," and then to "invoke divine favor upon."
