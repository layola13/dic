Etymology: From Middle English *fond, from Old English *gefondian (“to try, tempt, test, prove”), from Proto-Germanic *fandijaną (“to try, tempt, experience”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰendʰ- (“to bind, tie”). The sense evolution is from "foolish, silly" (from being easily tempted or deceived) to "affectionate, loving" (perhaps from the idea of being foolishly attached to someone).
