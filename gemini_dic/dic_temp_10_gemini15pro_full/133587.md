PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's a humorous and deliberately awkward word, so constructing common phrases is difficult.  Here are some theoretical examples for illustrative purposes.)

注意事项:

The word "nonflatulently" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "flatulent" (meaning "producing gas") and then adding the adverbial suffix "-ly."  It is not a common word in everyday usage.
