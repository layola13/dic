PHRASE->
Unfortunately, "curveyest" isn't a common enough word to have established phrases.  It's a descriptive adjective, so it's typically used directly with the noun it modifies (e.g., "curveyest woman," "curveyest gaze").  It's difficult to create natural-sounding phrases without forcing the usage.
