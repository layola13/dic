catholicalnesses:  This word is not a standard English word and is likely a misspelling or a neologism. It doesn't appear in standard dictionaries and has no established usage. It seems like an attempt to create a plural noun form from "catholical," which itself is an archaic or uncommon variant of "catholic."  Therefore, providing a standard linguistic breakdown is not possible.

However, if we were to analyze it based on its apparent intended meaning, we can speculate:

/ˌkæθəˈlɪkəlnəsəz/ | n. (non-standard) |  普遍性，广泛性 (hypothetical) | A hypothetical plural form of "catholical," suggesting multiple instances of universality or broad-mindedness. |  No established examples exist due to the word's non-standard nature.  A hypothetical example could be: "The catholicalnesses of his interests were impressive." (Meaning: The wide range of his interests were impressive.) | Near synonyms (for "catholical"): universal, broad, comprehensive, eclectic | Antonyms (for "catholical"): narrow, limited, restricted | Noun (hypothetical)
