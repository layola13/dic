ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *crabba, from Proto-Germanic *krabbaną, from Proto-Indo-European *gerbʰ- (“to scratch, carve”). Cognate with Dutch krab (“crab”), German Krabbe (“crab”), Old Norse krabbi (“crab”). The verb sense "to complain" is first recorded in the early 20th century, possibly influenced by the crab's sideways movement or its pinching claws.
