The word "mindes" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a neologism.  If you could provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, the intended meaning), I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.

Since I can't analyze "mindes," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么, 哪一个, 多么 | used to ask for information about something; used to ask for information specifying something; used to express surprise or disbelief. |
