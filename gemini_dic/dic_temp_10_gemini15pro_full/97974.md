Note: "inobservation" is not a standard English word.  "Under observation" or "in observation" (without joining them) are the standard forms.  This entire answer assumes the user intended "under observation" and has been formatted accordingly.  If "inobservation" was intended as a newly coined term, the usage examples would need substantial revision.
