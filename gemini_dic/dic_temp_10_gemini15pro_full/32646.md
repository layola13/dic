词源：Probably from Old English *ceosel or *cisel, related to Old Norse kjǫsull, meaning "gravel," and ultimately from a Proto-Germanic root *keus-, meaning "to choose, pick out," perhaps referring to the act of picking out stones.  (可能来自古英语 *ceosel 或 *cisel，与古挪威语 kjǫsull 相关，意思是“砾石”，最终来自原始日耳曼语词根 *keus-，意思是“选择、挑选”，也许指的是挑选石头的行为。)
