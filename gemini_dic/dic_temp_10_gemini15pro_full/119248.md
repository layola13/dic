micelle:/maɪˈsɛl/ /mɪˈsɛl/| n. |胶束，微团|A tiny spherical aggregate of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid. A micelle forms when the concentration of surfactant is greater than the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The hydrophilic "heads" of the surfactant molecules form the outer surface of the micelle, while the hydrophobic "tails" cluster together in the interior.|The detergent formed micelles in the water.|Synonyms: aggregate, cluster|Antonyms: monomer, dispersion|noun

micelle:/maɪˈsɛl/ /mɪˈsɛl/| n. |微胞|A small spherical structure formed by aggregates of molecules (such as those of soap) with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends, with the hydrophilic ends facing outwards and the hydrophobic ends facing inwards.|Micelles play a crucial role in the absorption of fats in the small intestine.|Synonyms: aggregate, cluster|Antonyms: monomer, dispersion|noun
