词源:  "Ilkoon" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a transliteration from another language, possibly Korean (일쿤 - ilkun), where it can carry similar connotations of wrongdoing or sexual misconduct. However, its usage and recognition within English are extremely limited.  It's crucial to exercise caution when using this term, as it may not be understood and could cause confusion or offense.  If you intend to discuss child sexual abuse or other criminal activities, it's highly recommended to use established English terminology such as "child sexual abuse," "sexual assault," or other appropriate legal terms.
