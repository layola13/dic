注意事项:  *Parataxis* itself doesn't decline for tense.  It describes a structural relationship between clauses, not an action that takes place at a specific time.  Thus, the tense examples above are not directly applicable to the word *parataxises* itself, but rather demonstrate how clauses connected by parataxis might appear in different tenses.
