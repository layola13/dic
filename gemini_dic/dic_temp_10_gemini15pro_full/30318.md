ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin  *cēnsōrius*  "of a censor," from  *cēnsor*  "censor," from  *cēnsēre*  "to assess, judge, estimate."  The original Roman censors were magistrates who took the census and supervised public morals.  The modern meaning of "critical" developed from the censor's role in judging behavior.
