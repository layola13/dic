词源：

From in- + estimable + -ity.  "In-" prefix meaning "not" + "estimable" meaning "capable of being estimated" + "-ity" suffix forming nouns of quality or condition.  Ultimately from Latin *aestimābilis*, from aestimō (“I estimate, value”).

用法说明：

"Inestimabilities" is the plural form of "inestimability." Both words refer to something that is too great or valuable to be measured or calculated. "Inestimabilities" is less commonly used than "inestimability."  It refers to multiple things which are inestimable.
