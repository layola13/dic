ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *betrouthed*, past participle of *betrouthen*, from Old English *betrēowþian* (“to pledge one's faith, engage, promise”), from *be-* (an intensifying prefix) + *trēowþ* (“truth, faith, pledge, covenant”), from Proto-Germanic *treuwō* (“faith, loyalty”).  Cognate with Dutch *betrouwen* (“to entrust”), German *trauen* (“to trust, dare”), Old Norse *trúa* (“to believe, trust”).  The sense shifted from “promised” to specifically “promised in marriage”.
