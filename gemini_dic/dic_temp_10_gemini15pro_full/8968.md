Etymology:
From anti- + hypochondriac.  "Anti-" is a prefix of Greek origin meaning "against," "opposite of," or "opposed to." "Hypochondriac" comes from Late Latin "hypochondriacus," referring to the hypochondria, the region of the abdomen believed in ancient medicine to be the source of melancholy and hypochondriasis.
