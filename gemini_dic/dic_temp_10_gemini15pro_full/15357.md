backstress: /ˈbækˌstrɛs/ | n. | 背应力，回复应力 |  In materials science, backstress represents the internal stress that opposes the applied stress and contributes to kinematic hardening.  It's a concept used in plasticity theory to describe the Bauschinger effect, where a material's yield strength is reduced after being loaded in one direction and then unloaded and loaded in the opposite direction. | The backstress in the material increased with cyclic loading. 材料的背应力随着循环加载而增加。 | The backstress prevented further deformation of the metal.  背应力阻止了金属的进一步变形。 | synonyms: residual stress, opposing stress | antonyms: applied stress, forward stress | noun
