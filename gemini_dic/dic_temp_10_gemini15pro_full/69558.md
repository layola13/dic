*Note:* "Fellowshiping" is less commonly used than "fellowship" as a verb.  It's more common to use phrases like "having fellowship," "sharing fellowship," or simply "fellowship" as a verb.  While grammatically correct, "fellowshiping" might sound slightly awkward in some contexts.  Using "fellowship" as a verb is generally preferred.
