词源： "connecterized" is a relatively modern term formed by adding the suffix "-ized" to the noun "connector."  The suffix "-ized" means "to make or become like," or "to treat or affect with."  Therefore, "connecterized" means "made with or like connectors."  The word "connector" itself comes from the verb "connect," which has roots in the Latin "connectere," meaning "to bind together."
