PHRASE->

(This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  It's a fairly specific verb.  Therefore, providing phrases that force the word into unnatural usage isn't helpful. Instead, I'll provide examples of how the prefix "out-" can be used to create similar verbs with some common phrases.)

outperform the market  (跑赢市场)
outdo oneself (超越自我)
outwork everyone (比任何人都努力)
outsmart the competition (智胜竞争对手)
outrun the storm (跑赢暴风雨)



词源: "Out-" (prefix indicating exceeding or surpassing) + "hammer" (verb meaning to strike repeatedly with a hammer).  Thus, it means to surpass someone in hammering or to hammer something more intensely.
