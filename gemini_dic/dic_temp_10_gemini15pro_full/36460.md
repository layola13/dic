反义词：gradually, progressively |
词性：adverb, adjective, noun


词源：This term originated in the early 20th century. The exact origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests that the pale, clammy skin and goosebumps experienced during withdrawal resemble the skin of a cold, uncooked turkey. Another theory posits that the sudden and complete cessation is akin to serving cold turkey – a quick, straightforward, and unembellished dish.
