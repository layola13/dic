PHRASE-> (Not applicable in modern English.  These phrases wouldn't use "mustest")

词源:
From Middle English *mostest*, *mustest*, from Old English *mōstest* (second person singular preterite indicative of *mōtan* (“to be able, have opportunity, may, must”)), contraction of *mōtestu*. Cognate with Old Frisian *mōstest*, Old Saxon *mōstis*, Old High German *muostes*, Old Norse *mást* (“thou mayst”).

注意事项:
"Mustest" is an archaic form and is not used in modern English.  It is the second person singular preterite indicative form of "must" used with the pronoun "thou."  It carries a sense of obligation or necessity.  In modern English, "must" is used for all persons and is generally considered a present tense modal verb, although it can have future implications.
