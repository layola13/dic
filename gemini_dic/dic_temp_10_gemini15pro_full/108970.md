注意事项:

"leet's" is very informal and mostly used in online gaming communities.  Its use in formal settings or standard written English is generally discouraged.  It is often associated with "leetspeak," a style of writing that uses alternative spellings, symbols, and numbers in place of letters.  While grammatically a contraction of "let us," its usage is often more aligned with "let's."  It's crucial to understand its informal and niche context.
