注意事项:

"Lah" is primarily used in spoken Singaporean and Malaysian English.  Its usage can be complex and nuanced, conveying a range of emotions and pragmatic functions depending on context and intonation. While it can sometimes be translated as "okay," "right," or "alright," these translations don't fully capture its meaning. It's best learned through exposure to the spoken language.  Its usage can also be considered informal.
