词源:
The origin of "chock-a-block" is nautical. "Chock" refers to a wedge used to secure something, like a barrel or a wheel. "Block" refers to a pulley block. When a ship's tackle was hauled as tight as it could go, the blocks would be pulled "chock" to the block, hence "chock-a-block."  Over time, this nautical term came to be used figuratively to describe anything that is crammed full.
