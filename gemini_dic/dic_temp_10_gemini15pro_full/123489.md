monosymmetrical:/ˌmɒnəsɪˈmetrɪkəl/ /ˌmɑːnəsɪˈmetrɪkəl/
| adj. | 单对称的；非轴对称的 | Having only one plane of symmetry. | The monosymmetrical design of the building made it stand out.  这栋建筑的单对称设计使其脱颖而出。 | Examples: The butterfly's wings are monosymmetrical. 蝴蝶的翅膀是单对称的。 The artist intentionally created a monosymmetrical sculpture. 艺术家特意创作了一个单对称的雕塑。 | Near Synonyms: asymmetrical, non-symmetrical | Antonyms: symmetrical, bisymmetrical | 词性: 形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From mono- (one) + symmetrical.  "Mono-" comes from Greek "monos" (single, alone). "Symmetrical" comes from Late Latin "symmetricus" and Greek "symmetros" (of like measure).
