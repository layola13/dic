overmodulation:/ˌōvərˌmɑdʒəˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 过度调制 | Applying a signal with an amplitude larger than that allowed for the proper operation of a device. It occurs when the modulating signal's amplitude exceeds the carrier signal's capability, causing distortion and loss of information. | The overmodulation caused the audio signal to sound distorted. 过度调制导致音频信号失真。 | Overmodulation of the radio signal resulted in interference with nearby channels.  无线电信号的过度调制导致对附近频道的干扰。 | 近义词: distortion, clipping | 反义词: undermodulation | 词性: noun
