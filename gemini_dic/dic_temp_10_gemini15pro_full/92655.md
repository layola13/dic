词源:  "iBoat" is a relatively recent term, likely popularized with the rise of inflatable boat brands. It combines "i-" (often used to denote "internet" or "individual" in modern product names) with "boat."  While the "i-" prefix doesn't have a direct etymological connection here, it's used to suggest a modern, portable, and perhaps even technologically advanced version of a traditional boat. The word "boat" itself has a long history, stemming from the Old English "bāt," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*baitaz."
