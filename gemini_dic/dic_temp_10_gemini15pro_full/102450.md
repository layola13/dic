词源:  "jackhammered" comes from "jackhammer," a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that delivers repeated percussive blows.  "Jack" in this context likely refers to a mechanical device that lifts or exerts force. "Hammer" refers to the tool's hammering action.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun "jackhammer" into a verb (past tense or past participle) or an adjective.
