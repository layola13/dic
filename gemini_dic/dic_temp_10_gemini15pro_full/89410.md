homothallism: /ˌhɒməˈθælɪzəm/ | n. | 同宗配合; 自配生殖 |  The condition in which sexual reproduction can occur within a single thallus or mycelium, without the involvement of another thallus or mycelium of a different mating type.  In other words, a homothallic fungus is self-fertile. | Example 1:  Homothallism is common in many fungal species.  许多真菌种类中常见同宗配合。

Example 2: The homothallism of this species allows it to reproduce even in isolated environments.  该物种的自配生殖能力使其即使在隔离的环境中也能繁殖。 | Synonym: self-fertility, self-compatibility | Antonym: heterothallism | noun


USAGE->

Example 2:  The discovery of homothallism has changed our understanding of fungal reproduction. 同宗配合的发现改变了我们对真菌繁殖的理解。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Not applicable.  Homothallism describes a characteristic, not a continuous action.


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Example 1:  Scientists discovered homothallism in this species decades ago. 科学家们几十年前就发现了该物种的同宗配合现象。
Example 2: The study revealed the homothallism of the fungus. 这项研究揭示了这种真菌的同宗配合现象。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Not applicable. Homothallism describes a characteristic, not an ongoing action in the past.


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Example 1: Researchers had already identified homothallism in several species before the new study. 在新的研究之前，研究人员已经在几个物种中发现了同宗配合现象。
Example 2: They had observed homothallism in the lab prior to the field study. 在野外研究之前，他们在实验室中观察到了同宗配合现象。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Not applicable. Homothallism describes a characteristic, not a continuous action in the past.


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Example 1:  Further research will investigate the genetic basis of homothallism. 进一步的研究将探讨同宗配合的遗传基础。
Example 2: Scientists will likely discover more homothallic species in the future. 科学家们将来可能会发现更多同宗配合的物种。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Not applicable. Homothallism describes a characteristic, not a future ongoing action.


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
Example 1: By 2030, scientists will have gained a deeper understanding of homothallism. 到2030年，科学家将对同宗配合有更深入的了解。
Example 2: Researchers will have completed the study of homothallism in this species by next year. 到明年，研究人员将完成对该物种同宗配合的研究。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
Not applicable. Homothallism describes a characteristic, not a continuous action in the future.


虚拟语气:
Example 1: If the fungus were heterothallic, it would require a partner for reproduction. 如果这种真菌是异宗配合的，它就需要一个伴侣来繁殖。
Example 2: I wish we knew more about the evolutionary origins of homothallism. 我希望我们对同宗配合的进化起源有更多的了解。


被动语态:
Example 1: Homothallism is observed in many fungal species. 在许多真菌物种中都观察到了同宗配合。
Example 2: The mechanism of homothallism is being investigated. 同宗配合的机制正在研究中。


疑问句:
Example 1: Is this species homothallic or heterothallic?  这个物种是同宗配合还是异宗配合？
Example 2: What are the advantages of homothallism?  同宗配合的优势是什么？


否定句:
Example 1: This species is not homothallic. 这个物种不是同宗配合的。
Example 2: The fungus does not exhibit homothallism. 这种真菌没有表现出同宗配合。
