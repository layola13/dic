词源:

From over- + peremptory.  "Peremptory" comes from the Late Latin *peremptorius, from Latin perimere "to destroy, kill," from per- "thoroughly" + emere "to take, buy."  The sense evolution is from "destructive" to "decisive" to "final."  "Over-" intensifies the meaning, implying an excessive degree of peremptoriness.
