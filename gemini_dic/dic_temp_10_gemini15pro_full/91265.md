hydrogel:/ˈhaɪdrəˌdʒɛl/| n. |水凝胶|A network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic, sometimes found as a colloidal gel in which water is the dispersion medium. Hydrogels are highly absorbent (they can contain over 99% water) natural or synthetic polymers. They also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue, due to their significant water content.|The scientists developed a new hydrogel for wound dressing. 科学家们开发了一种用于伤口敷料的新型水凝胶。|Synonyms:  hydrocolloid, polymer gel|Antonyms: xerogel|Noun
