ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *calibratus, past participle of *calibrare, from Latin calibre "fineness, quality," from Greek kalopous (genitive kalopodos) "a shoemaker's last," from kalos "beautiful" + pous "foot."  The original sense was "to measure the bore of a gun," later extended to measuring or adjusting other instruments.
