注意事项:

"Organity" while grammatically correct, isn't commonly used.  "Organic matter" or "organic material" are much more frequent and preferred in scientific and general usage.  This explains the slightly awkward phrasing in some example sentences.  It's attempting to demonstrate usage in different tenses while adhering to the prompt's requirement to use the word "organity."
