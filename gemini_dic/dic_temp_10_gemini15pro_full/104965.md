词源: From Middle English *kempe, *campe, from Old North French campe (“fighter, champion”), from Late Latin campus (“battlefield, open space, plain”), from Latin campus (“field, plain”). Compare Old English camp ("battle, contest, fight," and also "a place for athletic exercises, enclosed space"),  Old Frisian kamp (“battle, fighting”), and Middle Dutch kamp (“battle”). Doublet of camp.


注意事项：这个词语非常古老，现在很少使用，主要出现在历史或文学语境中。 作为“梳子”的含义更加罕见。
