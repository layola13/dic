ETYMOLOGY->
Derived from the verb "ghost," which means to disappear suddenly and completely.  The "-ing" suffix turns it into a gerund (a noun formed from a verb), and the apostrophe and "s" indicates possession.  The term gained popularity in the early 21st century with the rise of online dating and social media.  It refers to the practice of ending a personal relationship by suddenly withdrawing from all communication, without explanation or warning.
