metergram:/ˈmiːtərɡræm/ |n.|毫克|A unit of mass equal to one thousandth of a gram (0.001 grams). It is also sometimes referred to as a milligram. |A metergram is a very small unit of mass, typically used in scientific measurements.|近义词: milligram (mg)|反义词: kilogram (kg)|词性:noun

Etymology:
From 'meter-' (meaning a millionth) + 'gram'.  However, this formation is incorrect, as 'meter-' indicates a millionth, while a thousandth is 'milli-'. The correct term is milligram. Metergram is rarely used and considered a misnomer.
