词源:
"Ablen" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a misspelling or a non-standard variant of "able."  The word "able" comes from the Old French "hable," ultimately derived from the Latin "habilis," meaning "apt," "fit," or "suitable."

Again, it's important to emphasize that "ablen" is not a standard English word. Using "able" is the grammatically correct choice.
