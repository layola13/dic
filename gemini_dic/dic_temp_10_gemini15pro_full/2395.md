ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *adipos* (fatty) + -y (suffix forming adjectives).

USAGE->
This word is rarely used in modern English.  More common terms like "fatty" or "adipose" are preferred. Therefore, providing usage examples for various tenses and grammatical constructions might be misleading as the word itself isn't commonly employed in those contexts.  However, here are some theoretical examples based on how a similar adjective might be used:

一般现在时:
The adipsy tissue is important for insulation. = 脂肪组织对隔热很重要。
Adipsy individuals are more susceptible to certain health risks. = 肥胖的人更容易受到某些健康风险的影响。

注意事项:
"Adipsy" is an uncommon word.  While grammatically correct, it's less frequently used than synonyms like "fatty" or "adipose," especially in modern scientific and medical contexts. Using "adipose" (especially "adipose tissue") is generally preferred.
