ETYMOLOGY->
"Homz" is a non-standard spelling of "homes," the plural of "home."  The word "home" comes from Old English "hām," meaning "dwelling, house, village, residence."  The use of "z" in place of "s" for the plural is likely influenced by African American Vernacular English (AAVE), where this substitution sometimes occurs.
