neurochord:/ˈnʊərəˌkɔːrd/ | n. |神经索|A cord of nervous tissue forming the main nerve of the central nervous system in chordates and some other invertebrates, usually lying along the dorsal side of the body.|The neurochord is essential for coordinating movement and sensory input in these organisms.|近义词: nerve cord, spinal cord |反义词: None |词性: noun

Etymology:
From neuro- +‎ chord.  Neuro- comes from Greek *νεῦρον (neûron, “sinew, tendon, nerve”). Chord comes from Greek *χορδή (khordḗ, “gut, string”).
