PHRASE->
(Lotter is not commonly used in phrases.  It's typically used as a standalone noun.)



词源:  Likely from the Middle Dutch "loteren" meaning "to shake, to rattle, to dangle", implying a sense of aimlessness or lack of purpose. This evolved to refer to someone who lives idly and engages in petty, often dishonest activities.
