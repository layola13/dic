gamomorphism:/ˌɡeɪməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 同态 | A structure-preserving mapping between two algebraic structures of the same type (e.g., groups, rings, vector spaces). It preserves the operations defined on the structures. | The logarithm is a gamomorphism from the multiplicative group of positive real numbers to the additive group of real numbers. 对数是从正实数的乘法群到实数的加法群的同态. | isomorphism, homomorphism |  N/A | noun
etymology->From Greek *γαμος (gamos, “marriage, union”) +‎ *-μορφισμος (-morphismos). Coined by Bourbaki.
