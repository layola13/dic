ETYMOLOGY->
non- + churchgoer

"non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "lack of."  It comes from Latin "non."

"churchgoer" combines "church" (a building for public Christian worship) with "goer" (one who goes to a specified place or event). "Church" ultimately derives from Greek "kyriakon doma" (the Lord's house).  "Goer" comes from the Old English verb "gān" (to go).
