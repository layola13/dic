maturements: /məˈtʃʊərmənts/ | n. | 到期日; 偿还期 |  A date on which a debt, such as a loan or bond, becomes due for payment.  This word isn't standard English and likely represents a misspelling or mishearing of "maturities." | *Incorrect Usage:  The maturements for these bonds are staggered over the next five years.* (This should be "maturities") | 近义词: maturities, due dates, redemption dates | 反义词: issuance dates | 词性: noun
