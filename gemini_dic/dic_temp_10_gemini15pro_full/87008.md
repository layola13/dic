henries:/ˈhɛnriz/| n.|亨利（电感的单位）|The plural form of henry, the unit of inductance.  It represents the inductance of a circuit in which an electromotive force of one volt is produced by a current varying at the rate of one ampere per second.|The inductor has an inductance of several henries.|近义词: (No direct synonym as it's a unit of measurement. Can use terms like "inductance value" in certain contexts.)|反义词: (No antonym for a unit of measurement.)|词性:noun

PHRASE->
(Henries being a unit of measurement doesn't typically have common phrase pairings.  Phrases would involve the broader concept of "inductance".)


注意事项:  As noted, henries is a plural noun related to a specific unit of measurement, so it doesn't lend itself to the same kind of phrasing or idiomatic usage as more general vocabulary.
