ecotype:/ˈiːkəʊtaɪp/| n. |生态型|A distinct form or race of a plant or animal species occupying a particular habitat.  A population or group of populations adapted to specific environmental conditions such as climate, soil, or altitude, and genetically distinct from other ecotypes of the same species.|例句：The researchers studied different ecotypes of the plant to understand their adaptations to varying altitudes. 研究人员研究了这种植物的不同生态型，以了解它们对不同海拔高度的适应性。

例句：The ecotypes of this species of fish have developed unique coloration patterns depending on the clarity of the water they inhabit.  这种鱼的生态型根据它们栖息的水域的清澈程度发展出了独特的颜色模式。|近义词：race, variety, subspecies, form|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps consider "species" in a broad sense)|词性:noun
