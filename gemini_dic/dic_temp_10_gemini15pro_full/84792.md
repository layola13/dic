Etymology:
handsome + -ish.  "Handsome" comes from Middle English *handsom*, meaning "easy to handle or manage, convenient."  The meaning shifted to "dexterous, skillful" and later to "pleasing in appearance."  The suffix "-ish" is from Old English *-isc* and forms adjectives meaning "somewhat, rather, approaching."  It softens the original adjective, indicating a degree or approximation.
