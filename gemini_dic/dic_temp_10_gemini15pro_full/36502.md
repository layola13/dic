词源：
From Old French colet "necklace, collar," diminutive of col "neck," from Latin collum "neck."

注意事项:
"Colet" is an archaic word and is rarely used in modern English. "Collar" or "necklace" are more common terms.  While "colet" can technically refer to any band worn around the neck, in modern usage, if encountered, it would most likely refer to a decorative necklace.
