intersampling:/ˌɪntərˈsæmplɪŋ/ | n. |间采样，子采样|The process of sampling a signal at a lower rate than the original sampling rate, effectively reducing the number of samples representing the signal. | Example: Intersampling can be used to reduce the data rate for transmission or storage. 间采样可以用来降低传输或存储的数据速率。

Example:  Intersampling can lead to aliasing if the original signal contains frequencies higher than half the new sampling rate. 如果原始信号包含的频率高于新采样率的一半，间采样会导致混叠。| 近义词: subsampling, decimation | 反义词: upsampling, interpolation | 词性: noun
