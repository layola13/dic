PHRASE->
iodous acid = 亚碘酸
iodous compound = 亚碘化合物
iodous oxide = 亚碘氧化物  (This is not a commonly used or stable compound, but theoretically possible)
iodous salts = 亚碘酸盐
properties of iodous compounds = 亚碘化合物的性质


Etymology: From iodine + -ous (suffix forming adjectives indicating a lower or less oxidized state).  The word "iodine" itself comes from the French "iode," which in turn comes from the Greek "ioeidēs" meaning "violet-colored," referring to the color of iodine vapor.
