PHRASE->
(Lawsy is generally used standalone and doesn't form common phrases.  It's more of an exclamation on its own.)  However, one might occasionally see something like:

"Lawsy, what's up with that?" (哎呀，那怎么回事?)  But this is simply using "lawsy" as an interjection before a question.
"Lawsy mercy, what a mess!" (我的天哪，真是一团糟！) This combines "lawsy" with another similar interjection.
"Lawsy, what in tarnation...?" (哎呀，这到底是什么……？)  Similar to above, combined with another informal expression.
"Well, lawsy me!" (哎呀，我的天哪！) Adding "me" for emphasis.
"Lawsy, I'll be..." (哎呀，我会……) Used as an interjection before expressing a reaction or intention.
