Etymology:
From dis- + regard + -ant.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of." "Regard" comes from the Old French word "regarder," meaning "to look at" or "to consider."  "-ant" is a suffix that forms adjectives.  Therefore, "disregardant" literally means "not regarding" or "not considering."
