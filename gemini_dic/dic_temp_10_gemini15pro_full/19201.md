Etymology:
From Middle English *bewreien*, from Old English *bewrēgan* (“to accuse, betray, reveal”), from Proto-Germanic *biwrōgijaną* (“to cover, wrap up, clothe, decorate”), from Proto-Indo-European *wer- (“to cover, enclose”).  The semantic shift is from “to expose by removing a covering” to “to reveal.”
