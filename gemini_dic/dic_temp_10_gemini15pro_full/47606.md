ETYMOLOGY->
From debauched + -ness. Debauched itself comes from the Old French desbaucher, meaning "to lead astray, seduce."  Ultimately, the word's origins trace back to the prefix des- (meaning "away from") and bauche (meaning "crossbeam" or "frame"), suggesting an image of something being led astray or pulled out of its proper framework or order.
