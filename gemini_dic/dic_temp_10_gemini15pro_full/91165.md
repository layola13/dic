PHRASE->
(Hydrae typically doesn't appear in common phrases.  Its usage is primarily scientific or mythological.)  Since the word is a proper noun, phrases are unlikely.  One could contrive examples, but they would not be considered common usage.  Therefore, I will provide phrases related to the *concept* of a hydra, acknowledging these are not phrases using the specific word "hydrae."

注意事项:
The pronunciation provided is the most common and generally accepted.  Variations may exist.  The word itself is not frequently used in everyday conversation, being largely confined to specific contexts like astronomy and mythology. Therefore, providing examples for all tenses can feel somewhat contrived, as they are not organic usages.  This is reflected in the examples provided.
