词源:
From Late Latin *parochialis, from Latin parochia "parish," from Ancient Greek παροικία (paroikia, “sojourn in a foreign land, temporary dwelling, colony”), from πάροικος (paroikos, “dwelling beside, neighbor”), from παρά (para, “beside, near”) + οἶκος (oikos, “house”).  The original sense referred to the limited perspective of a parish priest, hence the current meaning of "narrow-minded."
