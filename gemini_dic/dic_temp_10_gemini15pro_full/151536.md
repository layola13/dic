parsleyest:/ˈpɑːrsliɪst/ | adj. | 最像欧芹的；欧芹味最浓的 |  This is the parsleyest soup I've ever tasted.  This form, while grammatically possible, is extremely rare and generally considered non-standard English. It's created by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "parsley," which is unusual for a noun not typically used as an adjective. It functions similarly to a superlative adjective, describing something possessing the highest degree of parsley-like qualities. | 例句：This soup is parsleyest of all. 这汤是所有汤里欧芹味最浓的。

例句：The parsleyest dish was the tabbouleh. 欧芹味最浓的菜是塔博勒沙拉。


近义词：parsley-flavored, parsley-rich | 反义词：bland, flavorless | 词性：形容词


词源：From "parsley" + "-est" (superlative suffix). The word "parsley" ultimately comes from Old French "peresil," derived from Latin "petroselinum," meaning "rock parsley," from Greek "petroselinon," composed of "petra" (rock) and "selinon" (parsley).
