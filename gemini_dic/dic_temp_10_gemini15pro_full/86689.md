词源:
The word "hello" is relatively recent, first appearing in the mid-19th century.  It's thought to be related to "hallo" and "holla," used to attract attention. These, in turn, are likely related to the Old High German "halâ, holâ," meaning "hail!"  The use of "hello" as a telephone greeting was popularized by Thomas Edison.
