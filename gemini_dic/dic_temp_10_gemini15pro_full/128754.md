While it may appear in historical texts or be used in an attempt at reclamation,  it is crucial to understand the word's deeply offensive nature and avoid using it.  Using less harmful and more respectful language is essential.  When discussing historical contexts where this slur was used, it's important to explain the term's offensive nature and the harm it causes.  Using the word, even in a historical context, can be retraumatizing and hurtful.
