Etymology:

"Overfattens" is a Swedish word derived from "över" (over, excessive) and "fatta" (to grasp, understand), with the suffix "-ens" indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, it literally translates to "over-grasped" or "over-understood," implying an excessive level of detail that hinders comprehension.
