mosts: /moʊsts/
| n. (nonstandard, rare) |大多数，大部分 (非标准用法，罕见)| This word is not considered standard English and is rarely used. It attempts to pluralize "most," which is already a superlative and doesn't typically have a plural form.  Native speakers would generally use "most" or rephrase the sentence. |  (No grammatically correct example exists as "mosts" is not standard English. An incorrect example would be: *"He ate mosts of the cookies."* - This should be: He ate most of the cookies.) | 近义词：most, majority, greatest part | 反义词: least, fewest, minority | 词性:Noun (nonstandard)
