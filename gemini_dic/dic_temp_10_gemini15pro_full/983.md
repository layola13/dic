acanthopteri: /əˌkænθɒpˈtɪəriː/ /əˌkænθɑːpˈtɪriː/ | n. |棘鳍类，棘鳍鱼类|Acanthopterygii, or the acanthopterygians, are a group of ray-finned fishes, the largest clade in the class Actinopterygii.  They are distinguished by having the anterior rays of their dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins stiff and sharp, hence the name, from Greek akantha, meaning thorn or spine, and pteryx, meaning fin or wing.|Many common fish, such as cod, tuna, and perch, are acanthopterygians. 许多常见的鱼类，如鳕鱼、金枪鱼和鲈鱼，都属于棘鳍类。|A recent study suggests that acanthopterygians diversified after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. 最近的一项研究表明，棘鳍鱼类在白垩纪-古近纪灭绝事件后变得多样化。 |近义词: spiny-rayed fishes|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps consider soft-rayed fishes as a contrasting group)|词性:noun


ETYMOLOGY->
