ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *mincemete, from Old French minced mete (“minced meat”), from mincier (“to mince”) + mete (“meat”). The original meaning referred to minced meat, often mixed with spices and other ingredients. Over time, the meat component became less common, and the term came to refer primarily to the sweet mixture of fruits, spices, and suet used in mince pies, especially around Christmas.
