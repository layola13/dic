词源：The Luddites were a secret oath-based organisation of English textile workers in the 19th century who formed a radical faction which destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The group was protesting against the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices. Luddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry. They were named after Ned Ludd, a weaver said to have broken two stocking frames in a fit of rage. While the name is generally assumed to be fictitious, there is a possibility that it may have referred to a real person.  The term "Luddite" is now used to describe anyone opposed to technological or industrial change.
