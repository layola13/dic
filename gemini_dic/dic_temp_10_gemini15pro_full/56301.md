**Etymology:**

"Doggone" and "doggoning" are Americanisms likely originating in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. They are euphemisms for "goddamn" and "goddamned," with "dog" substituted for "god" to avoid blasphemy.  This type of euphemistic alteration is common in English, as seen in "gosh" for "God" and "darn" for "damn."
