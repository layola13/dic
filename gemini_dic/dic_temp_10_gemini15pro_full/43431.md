From crappy + -ness.  "Crappy" originated in the late 20th century as slang, likely derived from "crap," meaning excrement, thus implying something worthless or of poor quality. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "crappy" into the noun "crappiness," denoting the state or quality of being crappy.
