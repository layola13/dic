dereferencer:/diːˈrɛfərənsər/| n. |解引用器，指针解引用|A dereferencer is something (usually an operator in a programming language) that accesses the value stored at the location pointed to by a pointer or a reference.|The dereferencer operator * in C++ retrieves the value pointed to by a pointer.|近义词: pointer resolution|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps referencing)|词性: noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The dereferencer accesses the value. = 解引用器访问该值。
The * operator dereferences the pointer. = * 运算符解引用指针。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The program is dereferencing the pointer now. = 程序现在正在解引用指针。
The system is accessing the memory location using a dereferencer. = 系统正在使用解引用器访问内存位置。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The dereferencer has accessed the variable successfully. = 解引用器已成功访问变量。
The program has dereferenced the pointer several times. = 程序已经多次解引用指针。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been dereferencing the pointer for a while. = 程序一直在解引用指针一段时间了。
The system has been accessing the data using the dereferencer continuously. = 系统一直在使用解引用器连续访问数据。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The dereferencer accessed the value stored in memory. = 解引用器访问了存储在内存中的值。
The program dereferenced the pointer to retrieve the data. = 程序解引用指针以检索数据。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was dereferencing the pointer when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，程序正在解引用指针。
The system was accessing the memory location using the dereferencer at that time. = 当时，系统正在使用解引用器访问内存位置。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had dereferenced the pointer before the crash. = 程序在崩溃之前已经解引用了指针。
The system had accessed the value using the dereferencer before the interruption. = 系统在中断之前已经使用解引用器访问了该值。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been dereferencing the pointer for a long time before the issue arose. = 在问题出现之前，程序已经解引用指针很长时间了。
The system had been accessing the data using the dereferencer consistently before the failure. = 在故障之前，系统一直使用解引用器一致地访问数据。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The dereferencer will access the value later. = 解引用器稍后将访问该值。
The program will dereference the pointer to get the data. = 程序将解引用指针以获取数据。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be dereferencing the pointer during that process. = 在该过程中，程序将解引用指针。
The system will be accessing the memory location using the dereferencer at that time. = 那时，系统将使用解引用器访问内存位置。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
The program will have dereferenced the pointer by then. = 到那时，程序将已经解引用了指针。
The system will have accessed the data using the dereferencer before the next step. = 在下一步之前，系统将已经使用解引用器访问了数据。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The program will have been dereferencing the pointer for a few seconds before the output appears. = 在输出出现之前，程序将已经解引用指针几秒钟。
The system will have been accessing the data using the dereferencer continuously for an hour by the time the process completes. = 到进程完成时，系统将已经使用解引用器连续访问数据一个小时。


PHRASE->
dereferencer operator = 解引用运算符
using a dereferencer = 使用解引用器
dereferencer pointer = 解引用指针 (Technically incorrect, but commonly used)
null pointer dereferencer = 空指针解引用
dereferencer access = 解引用访问
