homoplast:/ˈhɒməˌplæst/ (US) /ˈhoʊməˌplæst/ (UK)| n. |同塑性, 同形质|A character shared by a set of species but not present in their common ancestor.  A homoplast evolves independently, usually due to similar environmental pressures or natural selection.  It's the opposite of a homology.|The wings of bats and birds are homoplasts; they serve the same function and look similar but evolved independently.|近义词：analogue, analogous structure|反义词: homologue, homologous structure|noun
