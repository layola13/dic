dangerousdendrs: /ˈdeɪndʒərəs ˈdɛndrəs/ | adj. | 危险的树枝 |  This is a descriptive phrase made up of "dangerous" (meaning posing a threat or risk of harm) and "dendrs," which seems to be a shortened or perhaps misspelled version of "dendrites" or "dendrons," both relating to tree branches.  In this context, it refers to tree branches that pose a danger, perhaps due to their instability, height, or sharp edges. | Example: The dangerousdendrs overhanging the path needed to be trimmed.  那些悬在小路上的危险树枝需要修剪。| Example: Be careful of the dangerousdendrs; they might fall. 小心那些危险的树枝；它们可能会掉下来。| 近义词: precarious branches, hazardous limbs, threatening boughs | 反义词: safe branches, secure limbs | 词性: 形容词
