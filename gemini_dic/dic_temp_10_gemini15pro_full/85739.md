ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *hawken, from Old English *hafocen (“to hawk”), from hafoc (“hawk”).  Originally, the term referred to the practice of falconry, where hawks were used to hunt.  Later, it came to mean carrying goods around for sale, perhaps because the act of carrying goods and calling out to potential customers was reminiscent of a hawk searching for prey.
