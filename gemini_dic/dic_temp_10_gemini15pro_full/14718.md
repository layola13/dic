awareness's: /əˈwɛːrnəsɪz/ | n. | 意识的; 认识的 |  This is the possessive form of "awareness," meaning "belonging to awareness." It's less common than simply using "of awareness." |  The awareness's impact was profound. (这种用法比较少见，更常见的表达是 "The impact of awareness was profound.") | 近义词: consciousness, understanding, realization | 反义词: ignorance, unawareness | 词性: 名词 (possessive)

词源:  From aware + -ness. "Aware" comes from Old English *gewar, from Proto-Germanic *gawaraz.  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns expressing quality or state.
