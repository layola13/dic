PHRASE->
"Ofter" is archaic and doesn't have common phrases associated with it in modern English.  Using "often" would be more appropriate.  Therefore, phrases with "often" are provided:

often enough = 经常；足够频繁
as often as not = 通常；往往
more often than not = 通常；多半
how often = 多久一次
quite often = 经常


注意事项:  "Ofter" is an archaic word and is rarely used in modern English.  "Often" is the preferred and grammatically correct form in contemporary usage.  Forcing "ofter" into different tenses and grammatical structures results in unusual and sometimes incorrect sentences.
