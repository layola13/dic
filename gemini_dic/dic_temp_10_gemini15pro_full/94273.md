注意事项:  "impersonals" itself isn't commonly used as a standalone noun.  It's more frequent to see the term "impersonal verbs" or discuss the concept of impersonality in grammar.  The examples and explanations above focus on the concept of impersonality in verb usage, which is what the prompt seems to be targeting.
