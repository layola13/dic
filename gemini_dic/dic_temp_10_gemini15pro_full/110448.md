ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *līcian "be pleasing," from Proto-Germanic *likōjaną (source also of Old Saxon līkon "be pleasing, please," Old Frisian līka "please, be fitting," Middle Dutch līken, Dutch lijken "seem, appear, resemble," Old High German līhhan, German leihen "lend"), from PIE root *leig- "to tie, bind." The sense evolution is perhaps from "be agreeable" to "be suitable" to "be pleasing."
