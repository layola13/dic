近义词: tasteless, bland, insipid, dull, vapid, uninspired, foolish, silly
反义词: flavorful, savory, tasty, interesting, intelligent, wise


词性: adjective


词源:  "In-" (not) + "sapory" (flavored).  While "sapory" itself isn't a common modern word, it derives from the Latin "sapor" (flavor, taste).  The prefix "in-" negates the presence of flavor, leading to the meaning "tasteless" and, by extension, "dull" or "uninspired."
