interresisted: /ɪntərˈrɛstɪd/ | adj. | 感兴趣的（这个词通常被认为是不标准或过时的）| Showing interest or concern in something or someone.  This word is often considered non-standard or archaic. It's likely a redundant form, as "interested" already conveys the intended meaning. |  While grammatically possible, native speakers rarely, if ever, use "interresisted".  It is recommended to use "interested" instead. | 近义词：interested, engaged, intrigued | 反义词：uninterested, apathetic, indifferent | 词性：形容词

词源: The word "interresisted" seems to be a redundant formation based on "interested."  "Interested" itself comes from the Latin "interesse" meaning "to be between," later evolving to mean "to concern, to be of importance."  The prefix "inter-" usually means "between" or "among."  Adding another "inter-" seems to be a duplication that doesn't add to the meaning.
