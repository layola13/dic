Etymology:
mis- (prefix) + predict (verb)

"mis-" comes from Old French "mes-" meaning "wrongly," ultimately from Latin "minus" meaning "less."  It implies doing something incorrectly or badly.

"predict" comes from Latin "praedicere" meaning "to foretell," from "prae-" (before) + "dicere" (to say).

Therefore, "mispredict" literally means "to say beforehand wrongly."
