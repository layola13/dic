词源:
From Old English *cumb, from Proto-Germanic *kumbaz "valley," related to Old Norse kumbl "short, enclosed valley," ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *gembh- "tooth, nail, peg, hook." The sense of "honeycomb" is a metaphorical extension from the "cells" resembling a valley. The sense of "wool comb" is also related to the "tooth" element of the root, referring to the comb's teeth.
