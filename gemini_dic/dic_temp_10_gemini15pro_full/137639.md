nonubiquitary: /ˌnɒnjuːˈbɪkwɪtəri/ | adj. | 非普遍存在的，非无所不在的 | Not present everywhere; not ubiquitous. |  The nonubiquitary nature of specialized medical equipment makes access challenging in rural areas.  专业医疗设备的非普遍性使得在农村地区获得这些设备具有挑战性。

The nonubiquitary distribution of the species makes it a subject of ongoing research.  该物种的非普遍分布使其成为持续研究的主题。 | 近义词：rare, scarce, uncommon, localized | 反义词：ubiquitous, omnipresent, widespread, universal | 词性: 形容词

词源:  Formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "ubiquitary," which is an adjective derived from "ubiquitous."  "Ubiquitous" comes from the Latin word "ubique" meaning "everywhere." 通过在“ubiquitary”（源自“ubiquitous”的形容词）前面加上前缀“non-”（意思是“不”）构成。“Ubiquitous”来自拉丁语“ubique”，意思是“到处”。
