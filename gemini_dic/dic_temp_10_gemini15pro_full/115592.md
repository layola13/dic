"Maravold" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a slang term, a proper noun (like a name), or a word from a specialized field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more specific information.

However, since the prompt requests demonstrations of grammatical concepts using the placeholder "what," I can provide that information:

what /wɒt/(UK) /wʌt/(US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonyms: which, whatever | Antonyms: N/A | Part of Speech: Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb
