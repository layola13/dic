注意事项:

* "Kuda" is primarily used in South Slavic languages like Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin.  It is less common in other Slavic languages.
* While the word itself is an adverb, its function is similar to an interrogative pronoun when asking "where to."
* The provided examples use Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian.  The word and its usage are very similar across these languages.  There might be slight dialectal variations.
* The future perfect continuous tense is often awkward with "kuda" and usually avoided in natural speech.  Simpler future tenses are preferred.
