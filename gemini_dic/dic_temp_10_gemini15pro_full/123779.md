词源: From moot (adj.) + -able.  Moot itself comes from Old English *mōt (noun) "meeting, assembly," related to metan "to meet."  The original sense of "moot point" was a subject for discussion at a meeting, especially in a mock court for practice.  Over time, the meaning shifted to "subject to debate," and eventually to "debatable, of little practical value."
