注意事项:  Holidam is an archaic word, primarily used in religious contexts, and is much less common than "holiday." While they share etymological roots, "holiday" has broadened in meaning to encompass secular breaks from work and study.  Therefore, using "holiday" is generally preferred in modern English.
