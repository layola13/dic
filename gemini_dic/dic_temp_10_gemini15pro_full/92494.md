hypothenusal:/ˌhaɪpɒˈθɛnjuːzl/ (US) /ˌhaɪpɒˈθɛnjuːzl/ (UK)| adj.|斜边的，直角三角形斜边上的|Relating to or being the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.|The hypothenusal length is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. 斜边长度是用勾股定理计算的。|The hypothenusal side is opposite the right angle. 斜边对着直角。|近义词: none (no single word synonym, the closest being "relating to the hypotenuse")|反义词: none|词性: adjective

词源: From Late Latin *hypothenusa*, from Ancient Greek ὑποτείνουσα (hupoteinousa, “subtending line, hypotenuse”), from feminine present participle of ὑποτείνω (hupoteínō, “I subtend, stretch under”), from ὑπό (hupó, “under”) + τείνω (teínō, “I stretch”).
