词源:  "counter-" (against) + "revolutionary" (relating to a revolution).  "Counter-" comes from Old French "contre-" from Latin "contra" (against). "Revolutionary" comes from "revolution" which derives from Late Latin "revolutionem" meaning "a revolving."  Therefore, "counter-revolutionary" literally signifies "against the revolution."
