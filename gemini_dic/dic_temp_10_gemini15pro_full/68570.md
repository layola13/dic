"Fangu" appears to be a misspelling or a word not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible it's a slang term, a regionalism, or from another language entirely.  If you could provide more context (e.g., the language it's from, where you encountered it), I can give you a more accurate analysis.

However, since the prompt requests an example using "hello," I will proceed with that:

hello:/həˈloʊ/ (US) /hɛˈləʊ/ (UK)| int. n. vt.| 你好；问候；打招呼 | Used as a greeting or to begin a phone conversation. | Hello, how are you? 你好，你好吗？| Hello there! 你好呀！ | hi, hey | goodbye | interjection, noun, verb
