Long time no see! (Often used following "hau" when greeting someone after a period of time) = 好久不见！

“Hau” is primarily used in informal settings in New Zealand.  While it has Māori origins, it's integrated into everyday New Zealand English.  It's not typically used in formal writing or communication.
