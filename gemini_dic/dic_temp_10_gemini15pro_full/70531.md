词源：From Spanish *filibustero* "freebooter," from Dutch *vrijbuiter* "freebooter, pirate," literally "free plunderer," from *vrij* "free" + *buiter* "plunderer."  The term was later applied to adventurers who tried to take over Central American countries in the mid-19th century, and then to the parliamentary tactic of obstruction.
