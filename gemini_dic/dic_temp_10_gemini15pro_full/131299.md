近义词: informally, casually, abruptly, roughly, unceremoniously
反义词: formally, ceremoniously, respectfully, politely

词性: adverb

词源:  From non- + ceremonious + -ly.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," "ceremonious" refers to something done with formality or ritual, and "-ly" is a suffix that forms adverbs.  Therefore, "nonceremoniously" literally means "not in a ceremonious manner."
