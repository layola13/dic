Etymology:
The origin of "johnnycake" is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests it's a corruption of "journeycake," a simple cornmeal cake easily carried by travelers. Another theory links it to "jonakin," a Narragansett word for corncake.  A third proposes a connection to "Shawnee cake," referencing a Native American tribe known for their cornmeal dishes. Regardless of its precise origin, the term "johnnycake" has been used since the 18th century to describe various cornmeal flatbreads.
