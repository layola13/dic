Etymology->
The phrase "in a bad way" originates from the earlier phrase "in bad way," which dates back to the late 18th century.  "Way" in this context refers to a state or condition. The addition of the indefinite article "a" solidified the phrase into its current form, "in a bad way," by the mid-19th century.  It evolved from literal descriptions of physical condition to encompass more abstract meanings of hardship and difficulty.
