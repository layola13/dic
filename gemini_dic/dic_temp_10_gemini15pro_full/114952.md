Because "manapur" isn't a recognized English word,  I can't provide accurate information about its etymology, synonyms, antonyms, or usage. If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered the word, the surrounding text), I might be able to offer more assistance.  It's possible there's been a typo, or it's a word from a specialized field or another language.
