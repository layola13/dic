ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin "abdomen" (belly) + "-al" (relating to) + "-s" (plural marker).


USAGE->
While "abdominals" is the grammatically correct plural form of "abdominal," in common usage, particularly in the context of fitness and exercise, "abs" is much more frequently used.  Using "abdominal's" with an apostrophe is grammatically incorrect.  The possessive form would be "abdominal's strength" (singular possessive) or "abdominals' strength" (plural possessive), although these forms are less common than simply saying "abdominal strength."

Correct Usage Examples:

He did 100 sit-ups to strengthen his abdominals. = 他做了100个仰卧起坐来增强腹肌。
Her abdominals were sore after the workout. = 她的腹肌在锻炼后感到酸痛。

Incorrect Usage (with apostrophe):
Avoid using "abdominal's" in this way.  Use "abs" or "abdominals".

PHRASE->
toned abdominals = 健美的腹肌
defined abdominals = 轮廓分明的腹肌
strengthen your abdominals = 增强你的腹肌
working on my abdominals = 锻炼我的腹肌
abdominal exercises = 腹肌锻炼
