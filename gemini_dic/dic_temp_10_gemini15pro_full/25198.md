The word "buddika" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, a word from a specific dialect, or even a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  However, if you meant "Buddha," I can offer the following:

Buddha: /ˈbuːdə/ | n. | 佛陀 |  The founder of Buddhism, Siddhartha Gautama.  | Example: The Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths. 佛陀教导了四圣谛。 | Example: Many statues depict the Buddha in meditation. 许多雕像描绘了佛陀在冥想。 | Synonym: Siddhartha Gautama, the Enlightened One | Antonym: N/A | Noun
