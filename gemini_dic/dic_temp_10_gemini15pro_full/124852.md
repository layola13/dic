mucopolysaccharidosis:/ˌmjuːkoʊˌpɒliˌsækəˈraɪdəʊsɪs/ | n. | 粘多糖贮积症 | A group of inherited metabolic disorders caused by a deficiency of enzymes needed to break down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), also known as mucopolysaccharides. These GAGs accumulate in various tissues and organs, leading to a wide range of symptoms. |  Mucopolysaccharidosis is a rare genetic disorder. 粘多糖贮积症是一种罕见的遗传疾病。 | 近义词: lysosomal storage disease | 反义词:  (No direct antonym for a disease) | 词性: noun


mucopolysaccharidosis:/ˌmjuːkoʊˌpɒliˌsækəˈraɪdəʊsɪs/ | n. | 粘多糖代谢病 |  A group of inherited metabolic disorders in which the body cannot break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).  The buildup of these GAGs can damage organs and cause a range of symptoms. | Several types of mucopolysaccharidosis exist, each with varying degrees of severity. 存在几种类型的粘多糖代谢病，每种类型的严重程度各不相同。| 近义词:  GAG storage disorder | 反义词: (No direct antonym for a disease) | 词性: noun
