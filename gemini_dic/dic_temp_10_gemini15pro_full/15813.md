ETYMOLOGY->

From Middle English *balken* "to hesitate," probably of Scandinavian origin; compare Old Norse *balka* "to resist," Swedish *balka* "to heap up, pile," Norwegian *balka* "to divide into compartments." The original sense might have been "to stumble," later developing the meaning of "hesitating" and then "stopping short."  The noun sense "obstacle" is derived from the verb.
