ETYMOLOGY->
"collapsability" comes from the verb "collapse" + the suffix "-able" + the suffix "-ity".

"Collapse" originates from the Latin word "collapsus," the past participle of "collabī," meaning "to fall together" or "to collapse."  "Collabī" is formed from "com-" (together) + "labī" (to slip or fall).

"-able" is a suffix of Latin origin, meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of being."

"-ity" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
