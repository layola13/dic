ADME:/ˈædmiː/
noun
吸收、分布、代谢、排泄 (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion)
ADME describes the disposition of a pharmaceutical compound within an organism.  It represents the body's effect on a drug, including how the drug is absorbed, where it goes, how it is changed by the body, and how it is eliminated.
The ADME properties of a drug candidate can influence its efficacy and safety profile. 该候选药物的ADME特性会影响其疗效和安全性。
ADME studies are crucial in drug development. ADME研究在药物开发中至关重要。

ETYMOLOGY->
ADME is an acronym formed from the initial letters of the words Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion.  Each of these words derives from Latin roots:

* **Absorption:** From Latin *absorbere*, meaning "to swallow up," from *ab* ("from") and *sorbere* ("to suck in").
* **Distribution:** From Latin *distribuere*, meaning "to divide among," from *dis* ("apart") and *tribuere* ("to allot").
* **Metabolism:** From Greek *metabolē*, meaning "change," from *meta* ("after, across") and *ballein* ("to throw").
* **Excretion:** From Latin *excernere*, meaning "to sift out," from *ex* ("out") and *cernere* ("to separate").
