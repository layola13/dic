"Inlive" is not a standard English word. It's likely a combination of "in" and "live," possibly intended to mean "live streaming" or "live broadcast."  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary definition. However, I can break down the potential interpretations and provide information on the components "in" and "live."

in: /ɪn/ | prep. adv. adj.| 在...里面，在...期间，进入，穿着，流行的 |  Expressing location or position within something. |  The cat is in the box. 猫在盒子里。| inside, within | outside | preposition, adverb, adjective
in: /ɪn/ | prep. adv. adj.| 在...里面，在...期间，进入，穿着，流行的 | Expressing inclusion or involvement. | She's in the team. 她在队里。| inside, within | outside | preposition, adverb, adjective


live: /lɪv/ | adj. adv. v.| 活的，现场直播的，居住，生活 |  Alive, not dead. | We saw a live band. 我们看了一场现场乐队演出。| living, alive | dead | adjective, adverb, verb
live: /lɪv/ | adj. adv. v.| 活的，现场直播的，居住，生活 |  Broadcast while actually happening. | The concert was broadcast live.  音乐会是现场直播的。| living, alive | dead | adjective, adverb, verb


Assuming "inlive" is intended to mean "live streaming" or similar:

inlive: /ɪnˈlaɪv/ | adj.  | 现场直播的 |  Happening and being broadcast simultaneously.  |  The event was inlive on YouTube.  这个活动在YouTube上现场直播。 | live streaming, broadcasting live | recorded | adjective (neologism)
