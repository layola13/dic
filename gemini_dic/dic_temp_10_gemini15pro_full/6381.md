amphid:/ˈæmfɪd/| n. | 感器，化学感受器 | A sensory organ, especially one of a pair of anterior chemoreceptors in certain nematodes. | Example 1: The nematode uses its amphids to detect chemicals in its environment. 线虫利用它的感器来探测环境中的化学物质。

Example 2:  Damage to the amphids can impair the nematode's ability to find food. 感器的损伤会削弱线虫寻找食物的能力。 | Synonym: chemoreceptor, sense organ | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "effector" as the opposite of a sensory organ) | noun
