give one's approval = 给予批准

注意事项:

“Approvance” while technically a word, is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  "Approval" is the preferred and more common term.  The examples above demonstrate how "approvance" *could* be used grammatically, but native speakers would almost always use "approval" instead.
