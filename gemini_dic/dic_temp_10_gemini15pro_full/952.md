ETYMOLOGY->
From "academic" + "-al" (suffix forming adjectives) + "-s" (plural suffix).  "Academic" derives from the Greek "akadēmikos" (belonging to an academy), from "akadēmeia" (academy), ultimately from "Akadēmos" (the hero Akademos, after whom Plato's academy was named).


USAGE->
There isn't a significant difference in usage between "academics" and "scholars."  "Academics" might more readily suggest university affiliation, while "scholars" may encompass a broader range of intellectual pursuits.  "Academics" can also sometimes have a slightly negative connotation, implying a detachment from practical concerns.

The academics debated the merits of the new theory.  学者们就新理论的优点进行了辩论。
