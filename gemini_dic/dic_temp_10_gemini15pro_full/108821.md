ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *lēofan (attested only in the past participle gelēfed "permitted, granted, left behind"), from Proto-Germanic *laubijaną (source also of Old Frisian lēva "to allow," Old Saxon farlēbid "leaves behind," Old High German gilouban "to allow, permit," German erlauben "to allow"), from Proto-Indo-European *leubh- "to care, desire, love."  The sense development is from "allow to remain" to "depart, go away."  The noun sense of "permission" is from the verb.
