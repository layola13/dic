heterophyllous:/ˌhɛtərəˈfɪləs/| adj.|异形的，异叶性的|Having different kinds of leaves on the same plant.|Example: Many aquatic plants are heterophyllous, with submerged leaves differing in shape from floating or aerial leaves. 许多水生植物是异叶性的，其沉水叶的形状与漂浮叶或气生叶不同。

Example: The heterophyllous nature of the plant allows it to adapt to varying environmental conditions.  这种植物的异叶性使其能够适应不同的环境条件。|近义词:polymorphic, variable|反义词:homophyllous, uniform|词性:adjective

Etymology: From Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, “different”) + φύλλον (phúllon, “leaf”).
