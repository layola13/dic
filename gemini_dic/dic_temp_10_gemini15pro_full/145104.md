ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + appreciativeness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Appreciativeness" is derived from "appreciate," which comes from the Latin "appretiare," meaning "to set a price to," from "ad" (to) + "pretium" (price).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "appreciative" into the noun "appreciativeness."
