ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French abillement, from habiller "to dress," from Old French habiller "to equip, furnish," from Frankish *habilijan, from Proto-Germanic *habilianą "to make fit, suitable," from *habilaz "fit, suitable."


USAGE->
The word "abiliment" is not commonly used in modern English. It is considered a rather formal and somewhat archaic term.  Therefore, providing usage examples across various tenses and grammatical structures might feel forced and unnatural.  It's more helpful to illustrate its usage in contexts where a more formal or literary tone is desired.

Formal writing:
The ceremonial abiliments of the high priest were intricate and symbolic. = 大祭司的礼服复杂而具有象征意义。
Ancient texts describe the abiliments of warriors in great detail. = 古代文献详细描述了武士的服饰。


Literary context:
"The knight, clad in shining abiliments, rode forth to meet his foe."  = "身穿闪亮盔甲的骑士策马而出，迎战他的敌人。"
"Her abiliments of mourning were simple but elegant." = "她朴素而优雅的丧服。"


PHRASE->
While "abiliment" doesn't readily form common phrases in the way simpler words like "clothes" or "dress" do, you could see phrases like these in more literary or archaic contexts:

ceremonial abiliments = 礼服
military abiliments = 军服
priestly abiliments = 祭司的服饰
royal abiliments = 皇家服饰
mourning abiliments = 丧服


注意事项:
Due to its infrequent use, employing "abiliment" in casual conversation might sound overly formal or even pretentious.  It's best reserved for situations where a heightened or more traditional style of language is appropriate.
