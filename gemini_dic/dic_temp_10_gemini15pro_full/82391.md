注意事项:

"grubbiness's" is grammatically unusual. While possessive forms of nouns are common, forming the possessive of an abstract noun ending in "-ness" is rare and generally considered awkward. It's more natural to express possession using "of" (e.g., "the grubbiness of the room" rather than "the room's grubbiness," and even more so with a second possessive, like "the grubbiness's of the room").  While theoretically possible, it's highly unlikely to be encountered in natural language.  Using "the grubbiness of" is always preferred.
