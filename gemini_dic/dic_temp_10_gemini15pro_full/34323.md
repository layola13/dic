The word "clarseth" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a specialized vocabulary or fictional context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis. 

If you meant "clarisseth," which is also not a recognized word, it's possible you're thinking of a word related to "clarity" or a proper noun.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.


Since I can't analyze "clarseth," I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information specifying something. |
