词源：over- + focusing. "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much" or "excessively".  "Focusing" is the present participle of the verb "focus," which comes from the Latin word "focus" meaning "hearth" or "fireplace."  The meaning shifted to "center point" and then to the act of concentrating on something.
