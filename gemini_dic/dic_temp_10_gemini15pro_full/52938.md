词源: From Old French disner (Modern French dîner), from Vulgar Latin *disjūnāre (“to break one's fast”), from Latin dis- (“apart, away”) + jējūnāre (“to fast”), from jējūnus (“fasting, hungry”). Originally meant "to breakfast", but the meaning shifted to "midday meal" and then to "evening meal" over time.
