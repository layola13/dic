hyperimmunity:/ˌhaɪpərɪˈmjuːnɪti/| n. |超免疫性，过度免疫|A condition of heightened immunity, where the immune system is excessively responsive, often leading to an exaggerated or inappropriate reaction to an antigen.|The doctor suspected hyperimmunity as the cause of her severe allergic reaction.|近义词: hypersensitivity|反义词: immunodeficiency|词性: noun
Etymology: hyper- (Greek, "over, excessive") + immunity (Latin, "immunitas," exemption from service or burden, later referring to exemption from disease)
