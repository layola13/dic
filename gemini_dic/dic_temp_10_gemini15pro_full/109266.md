词源:  From "lemming" + "-like." "Lemming" refers to a small rodent known for its mass migrations, sometimes ending in mass drownings.  This has led to the popular (though often inaccurate) belief that lemmings blindly follow each other to their deaths.  "-like" is a suffix used to form adjectives indicating resemblance.
