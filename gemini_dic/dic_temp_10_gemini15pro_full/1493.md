注意事项:
-  While "acetaminophens" is grammatically possible as a plural, it's almost exclusively used in the singular form ("acetaminophen") since it refers to the substance itself.  You would say "two tablets of acetaminophen," not "two acetaminophens."
- Be careful with dosage.  Excessive acetaminophen can cause liver damage.  Always follow the instructions on the label or consult a doctor.
