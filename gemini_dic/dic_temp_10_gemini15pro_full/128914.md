注意事项:

* "Nin" is very informal and dialectal, primarily used in the Midlands and northern England. It's not standard English.  Using it in formal contexts or in writing is generally discouraged.
* While grammatically representing a plural "you," its usage can sometimes feel singular, especially in quick conversation.  Context is key.
