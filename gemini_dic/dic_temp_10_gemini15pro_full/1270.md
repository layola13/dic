ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *acordament (modern French accordement), from acorder "to agree," from Latin ad- "to" + cor "heart."

USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  It's more common to see words like "agreement," "granting," or "bestowal" used instead.  Therefore, providing usage examples in different tenses and grammatical structures is difficult and may sound unnatural.  However, here are a few hypothetical examples based on the two main meanings:

Meaning 1 (Granting):

The king decreed the accordment of lands to his loyal knights. = 国王下令将土地授予他忠诚的骑士们。
The committee approved the accordment of a scholarship to the deserving student. = 委员会批准将奖学金授予这位优秀的同学。

Meaning 2 (Agreement/Harmony):

The accordment of their musical talents created a beautiful symphony. = 他们音乐才能的和谐创造了一曲优美的交响乐。
The accordment of their philosophies led to a fruitful collaboration. = 他们哲学思想的一致促成了一次富有成效的合作。


PHRASE->
Due to its archaic nature, "accordment" doesn't have common phrases associated with it.  It's more likely to be found in older texts or legal documents.
