cobaltic: /kəʊˈbɔːltɪk/ | adj. |钴的；含三价钴的 | Relating to or containing cobalt, especially in its +3 oxidation state. |  Cobaltic oxide is a black powder. 氧化钴是黑色粉末。| synonym: cobaltous (sometimes used interchangeably but less precise), trivalent cobalt | antonym: cobaltous (when referring specifically to +2 oxidation state) | word type: adjective

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *cobaltique*, from *cobalt* + *-ique*. Ultimately from German *Kobalt*, from *Kobold* (goblin, mischievous sprite), because the ore interfered with the smelting of other metals.
