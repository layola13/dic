The word "disencrese" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  It's possible the intended word is "decrease," which I will analyze below.


decrease: /dɪˈkriːs/ (UK), /dɪˈkriːs/ (US)
|n.| 减少；减少量 |A decrease is a reduction in the size, amount, or number of something.| The decrease in sales was alarming. | 销售额的减少令人担忧。 | reduction, decline, fall | increase, rise, growth | noun
decrease: /dɪˈkriːs/ (UK), /dɪˈkriːs/ (US)
|v.| 减少，降低 |To decrease means to become smaller or fewer in size, amount, or degree.|  The population of the village has decreased significantly. | 这个村庄的人口已经显著减少。 | reduce, diminish, lessen | increase, grow, expand | verb
