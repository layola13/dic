词源： From Late Latin barbaricus (source also of Old French barbariche), from Latin barbarus "foreign, strange; rude, uncivilized," from Greek barbaros (adj.) "foreign, non-Greek," probably imitative of unintelligible speech, like bar-bar.  来自后期拉丁语 barbaricus（也是古法语 barbariche 的来源），来自拉丁语 barbarus “外国的，陌生的；粗鲁的，不文明的”，来自希腊语 barbaros（形容词）“外国的，非希腊的”，可能是模仿难以理解的语言，如 bar-bar。
