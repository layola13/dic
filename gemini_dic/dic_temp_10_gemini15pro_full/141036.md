The word "onju" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

However, if you meant "unjust," here is the analysis:

unjust: /ˌʌnˈdʒʌst/ | adj. | 不公正的，不公平的 | Not fair; not based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair. |  Example: The unjust law was eventually repealed. 这项不公正的法律最终被废除了。 | Example: It's unjust to blame her for everything. 把一切都怪在她身上是不公平的。| Synonyms: unfair, inequitable, biased, prejudiced | Antonyms: just, fair, equitable, impartial | adjective
