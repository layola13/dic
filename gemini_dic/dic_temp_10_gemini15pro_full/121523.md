注意事项:
"mislum" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a misspelling or a neologism based on "misunderstand" and possibly influenced by words like "problem."  While it might be used informally, it's not recognized by dictionaries and should be avoided in formal writing.  Using "misunderstanding" or "misinterpretation" is recommended.
