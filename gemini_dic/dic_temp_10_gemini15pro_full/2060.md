ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *acustumance*, borrowed from Old French *acoostumance*, from *acoostumer* (“to accustom”), from Vulgar Latin *accostumare*, from Latin *ad* + *consuetudo* (“custom”).

USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  Therefore, providing usage examples in different tenses is not practical.  It's better to demonstrate its usage in a sentence reflecting the time period when it was common (Middle English/Early Modern English):

"By long acustumaunce, he knew the forest paths well." =  长期的习惯使他熟悉森林小径。
