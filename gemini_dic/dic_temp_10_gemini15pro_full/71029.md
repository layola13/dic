PHRASE->
N/A. "Firmness's" is rarely used in phrases.  It's more common to see phrases using "firmness" itself.


注意事项:
"Firmness's" is not a commonly used word.  "Firmness" is usually sufficient.  The possessive form is only necessary when specifically referring to the firmness belonging to something.  For example, "the tofu's firmness" is acceptable, but "firmness's" on its own is less natural.
