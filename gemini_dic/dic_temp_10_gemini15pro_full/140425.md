词源:  "Okayy" is a modern variant of "okay," whose precise etymology is debated, though most sources point to a humorous misspelling of "all correct" ("OK") in the 19th century.  The doubled "y" serves to emphasize or prolong the sound, adding a more informal and sometimes slightly exasperated tone.
