jinglier (comparative form of "jingly") is likely a non-standard or informal word derived from "jingle".

词源: "jingle" comes from the imitative verb "jinglen," frequentative of "jink."

用法说明:
"jinglier" is used to describe something that produces a more intense or unpleasant jingling sound compared to something else.  While not a common word in formal writing, it can be found in informal contexts or creative writing.  It's formed by adding "-er" to "jingly," which itself is derived from "jingle."  The base word "jingle" refers to a light, ringing metallic sound.
