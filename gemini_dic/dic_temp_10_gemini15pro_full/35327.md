cnns:/ˌsiː ɛnˈɛns/ | n. | 卷积神经网络 (Convolutional Neural Networks) | Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of artificial neural network that uses a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are designed to process pixel data and are used primarily for image recognition, object detection, and image classification. | Example 1:  CNNs are widely used in self-driving cars to recognize objects on the road.  卷积神经网络被广泛用于自动驾驶汽车中，以识别道路上的物体。

Example 2:  The researcher trained a CNN to classify different types of skin cancer.  研究人员训练了一个卷积神经网络来对不同类型的皮肤癌进行分类。 | 近义词: ConvNets | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it is a specific type of neural network) | 词性: noun
