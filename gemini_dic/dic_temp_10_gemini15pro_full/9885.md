注意事项:  "Apartnesses" is not a commonly used word.  "Apartness" (singular) is generally preferred.  While grammatically correct, the plural form might sound awkward in many contexts.  Consider using synonyms like "divisions," "segregations," or "isolations" depending on the specific nuance you wish to convey.
