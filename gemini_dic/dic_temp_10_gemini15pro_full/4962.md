alkalescency: /ˌælkəˈlɛsənsɪ/
n.
碱性，碱度
The property of being alkalescent; a slight degree of alkalinity.
The soil in this region shows marked alkalescency.  这个地区的土壤呈现明显的碱性。
近义词: alkalinity, basicity
反义词: acidity
词性: noun


Etymology:
From alkalescent + -ency.  Alkalescent from Latin alcalescens, present participle of alcalescere (“to become alkaline”), from alcali (“alkali”) (from Arabic القلي‎ (al-qaly, “ashes of the saltwort plant”)).  -ency from French -ence, from Latin -entia.
