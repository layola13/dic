nonirrationals:/ˌnɒnɪˈræʃənəlz/ | n. |非无理数；非無理數| Numbers that are not irrational. This includes rational numbers (like integers, fractions, and terminating or repeating decimals) and possibly other types of numbers depending on the context (e.g., complex numbers). |  Example:  The set of nonirrationals includes integers like 2 and -5. 非无理数集合包括像 2 和 -5 这样的整数。

Example:  0.75 is a nonirrational number because it can be expressed as the fraction 3/4. 0.75 是一个非无理数，因为它可以表示为分数 3/4。| 近义词: rationals, non-irrational numbers | 反义词: irrationals, irrational numbers | 词性: Noun
