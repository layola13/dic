Etymology:
From counter- + subversive.  "Counter-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite," derived from the Old French "contre-" and ultimately from the Latin "contra." "Subversive" comes from the Late Latin "subversivus," meaning "overturning," from the verb "subvertere," "to overturn," from "sub" (under) + "vertere" (to turn).
