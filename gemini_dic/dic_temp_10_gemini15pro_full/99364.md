ETYMOLOGY->
From inter- + dependent.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between, among, mutually, reciprocally," from Latin inter "between, among" (see inter-). "Dependent" comes from the Old French dependent and directly from Latin dependentem (nominative dependens), present participle of dependere "to hang down, hang from; be in debt; depend on," from de- "down, away from" (see de-) + pendere "to hang," from nasalized form of PIE root *(s)pen- "to draw, stretch, spin."
