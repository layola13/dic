geitonogamy: /ˌdʒaɪtənˈɒɡəmi/ | n. | 同株异花授粉 |  Pollination of a flower by pollen from another flower on the same plant. | Geitonogamy is functionally cross-pollination involving a pollinating agent, but genetically it is similar to autogamy since the pollen grains come from the same plant. 同株异花授粉在功能上是异花授粉，涉及到授粉媒介，但在遗传上类似于自花授粉，因为花粉粒来自同一株植物。|  Example 1: Although geitonogamy requires a pollinating agent, it is genetically similar to autogamy. 虽然同株异花授粉需要授粉媒介，但在遗传上类似于自花授粉。

Example 2:  Geitonogamy is common in plants that produce many flowers in close proximity, such as sunflowers. 同株异花授粉在开许多紧密相邻的花的植物中很常见，例如向日葵。 | 近义词:  (Not a true synonym, but related) cross-pollination | 反义词: autogamy, self-pollination | 词性: noun

PHRASE->

(Geitonogamy is a specialized term and doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  Therefore, providing phrases related to pollination is more relevant.)

pollination by insects = 昆虫授粉
wind pollination = 风媒授粉
cross-pollination vs. self-pollination = 异花授粉与自花授粉
the process of pollination = 授粉过程
pollination agents = 授粉媒介
