Etymology:
From the late Middle English *averay*, meaning "goods carried by ship," from Old French *averie*, from Medieval Latin *averia*, plural of *averium* "property of a deceased person," of uncertain origin. The sense shifted to "loss or damage to ship's cargo" and then to distributing such loss proportionally, hence "calculating a mean."  The "-ing" suffix creates the noun or adjective form related to the act of calculating an average.
