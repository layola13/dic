词源:
The word "gibaro" likely derives from the Spanish word "jíbaro," which itself has a complex and debated etymology. One theory suggests it originated from a Taíno (indigenous Caribbean) word meaning "mountain people."  Another possibility is a connection to the Spanish word "cibario," meaning "food" or "provisions," referring to people who lived off the land.
