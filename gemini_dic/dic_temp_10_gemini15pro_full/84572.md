词性: adjective

词源:  From "ham" (actor) + "-iest" (superlative suffix).  "Ham," referring to a bad actor, likely originated in the 19th century, possibly from a minstrel song called "The Ham-Fat Man."  The connection may be due to the perceived low quality of amateur actors who used ham fat to remove their makeup, or from the idea of "overacting" being as thick and unsubtle as ham fat.
