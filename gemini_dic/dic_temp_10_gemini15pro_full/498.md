ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English abood, from Old English ābād (“stay, delay, dwelling”), from ā (“always, ever”) + bād (“remained, stayed”).  Related to bide. The possessive form is created by adding 's.

USAGE->
The word "abode's" is less common than "abode" and is primarily used to show possession.  It's most often seen with descriptive adjectives preceding it, like "humble abode's" or "mountain abode's".

Example 1: The traveler sought shelter in the shepherd's humble abode's. = 旅行者在牧羊人简陋的住所寻求庇护。

Example 2:  The king's abode's were grand and spacious. = 国王的住所宏伟宽敞。


PHRASE->
While "abode's" itself doesn't form common phrases, "abode" does:

1. humble abode = 简陋的住所
2. permanent abode = 永久住所
3. last abode =  最后安息之所 (referring to death)
4. earthly abode =  尘世住所
5. take up (one's) abode =  居住


注意事项:
Because "abode" is already somewhat formal, using the possessive "abode's" can sound even more formal or even slightly archaic.  It's less common in everyday conversation.  Using "abode" followed by a possessive pronoun (e.g., "his abode," "their abode") is generally preferred in modern English.
