词源:  From Middle English *daggesweyn, from Old Norse *dagg-sveinn (“day-servant, boatswain's mate”), from dagg (“dew, day”) + sveinn (“boy, servant, swain”). Compare Icelandic daggsveinn. Equivalent to dag +‎ swain.


注意事项:  While "dagswain" is a valid historical term, it is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  "Boatswain" or "coxswain" are the preferred contemporary terms.
