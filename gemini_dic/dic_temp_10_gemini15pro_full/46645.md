注意事项:
*  "Damnest" is considered archaic and somewhat vulgar.  While it can be used for emphasis, it's generally best avoided in formal writing and polite conversation.  Consider using a less offensive synonym like "blasted" or "confounded".
*  The word is almost exclusively used as an attributive adjective (before a noun).  It's very rare to see it used predicatively (after a linking verb).
