注意事项:  This word, while grammatically correct in its formation, is extremely uncommon and likely never used in natural language.  It's highly artificial and serves more as a demonstration of how morphology works than a practical vocabulary term.  Using it in real-world communication would likely cause confusion due to its awkwardness and length.
