ETYMOLOGY->
From chintz, a printed calico fabric, often brightly colored and glazed, originally from India.  The word "chintz" comes from Hindi "chī̃ṭ", meaning "spotted cloth".  The association with cheapness and gaudiness developed later, likely because imitation chintz fabrics were often of lower quality.
