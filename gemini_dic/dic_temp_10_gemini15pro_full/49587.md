demerit's:/diːˈmɛrɪts/ | n. |缺点，过失，短处 | A mark awarded against someone for a fault or offense.  It refers to a flaw or disadvantage. Because it's already plural, adding an apostrophe-s is generally incorrect unless showing possession of the plural demerits themselves (e.g., "the demerits' impact").|  Example: The demerits of the proposal outweigh its merits. 这项提议的缺点大于优点。| Synonym: fault, flaw, defect, shortcoming, disadvantage | Antonym: merit, advantage, strength, virtue | Noun
