词源：
Originating in the early 20th century, the etymology of "canoodle" is uncertain.  Some speculate a connection to "noodle," perhaps referencing the playful intertwining of arms like noodles.  Others suggest a link to "canoodling," a Scottish term for whispering secrets. However, a definitive origin remains elusive.
起源于20世纪初，“canoodle”的词源不确定。一些人推测它与“noodle”（面条）有关，可能指的是像面条一样嬉戏地交缠手臂。另一些人则认为它与苏格兰语中的“canoodling”（窃窃私语）有关。然而，确切的起源仍然难以捉摸。
