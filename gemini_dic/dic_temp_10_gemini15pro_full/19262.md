词源:  "Bhutanese" derives from "Bhutan," the name of the country.  The etymology of "Bhutan" is debated, but it is likely derived from the Sanskrit "Bhota-anta," meaning "end of Tibet," or "Bhu-utthan," meaning "highlands."  The suffix "-ese" is used to form adjectives and nouns denoting origin or language, as in "Japanese" or "Portuguese."
