词源:
From Old French dependance, from Latin dependentia (“a hanging down, slope, declivity”), from dependēns, present participle of dependēre (“to hang down, hang from, depend on”).

注意事项:
"dependances" (with an "s" at the end) is an older, less common spelling, primarily used in British English, referring to outbuildings or subsidiary structures. The more common and modern spelling is "dependence," which refers to the state of relying on something or someone.  Avoid using "dependances" unless you are specifically referring to physical structures and aiming for a more archaic tone.
