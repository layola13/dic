ETYMOLOGY->
From adapt + -ed + -ness. Adapt comes from the Latin word "adaptare," meaning "to fit." The suffix "-ed" forms the past participle, indicating a state or quality resulting from the action of adapting. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "adapted" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being adapted.

They had observed the animal's adaptednesses to its environment for several years. = 他们已经观察了这种动物对环境的适应性好几年了。

将来时:
Future research will investigate the genetic basis of these adaptednesses. = 未来的研究将调查这些适应性的遗传基础。

PHRASE->
(Phrases with "adaptednesses" are uncommon. It's more natural to use phrases with "adaptation" or "adaptations.")
study of adaptednesses = 对适应性的研究
evolutionary adaptednesses = 进化适应性
the range of adaptednesses = 适应性的范围
the development of adaptednesses = 适应性的发展
the importance of adaptednesses = 适应性的重要性
