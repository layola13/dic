functor:/ˈfʌŋktər/| n. |函子|A mapping between categories that preserves the structure of the categories. In programming, it's often a function or object that can be treated as a function.  It takes objects as arguments and returns objects as values, while also preserving relationships between the objects. |The `map` function in many programming languages is a functor. It takes a function and a list and applies the function to each element of the list, returning a new list.|近义词:mapping, operator, transformation|反义词: N/A|词性:noun
