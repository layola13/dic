The word "billeters" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It's possible there's a misspelling, or it might be a word from another language, a technical term, or a very rare or archaic word.  If you could provide more context, such as the sentence where you encountered it, or the field it relates to, I might be able to offer a better analysis.

Assuming it's a misspelling, the closest possibilities I can think of are:

**1. "Billet-ers" (hypothetical)**

/ˈbɪlɪt-ərz/ | n. |  分派住处的人; 安排住宿的人 |  (Hypothetical word) People who assign billets (lodging). | Example: The billet-ers found accommodations for all the soldiers. 分派住处的人为所有士兵找到了住处。| Example: The refugees were grateful to the billet-ers for finding them a place to stay. 难民们很感激安排住宿的人为他们找到了住处。 | Near Synonyms: quartermasters, accommodation officers | Antonyms: evictors |  Noun

**2. "Bill Posters"**

/ˈbɪl ˈpoʊstərz/ | n. |  张贴广告的人;  | People who put up posters or advertisements, especially for events. | Example: The bill posters plastered the town with flyers for the circus. 张贴广告的人在镇上贴满了马戏团的传单。| Example:  The bill posters worked late into the night putting up advertisements for the concert. 张贴广告的人工作到深夜，张贴音乐会的广告。 | Near Synonyms: advertisers, promoters | Antonyms:  censors | Noun


Because "billeters" is likely a misspelling, providing a full grammatical analysis based on tenses isn't possible.  However, if you meant one of the words suggested above, I can provide examples for those.  Please clarify which word you intended.
