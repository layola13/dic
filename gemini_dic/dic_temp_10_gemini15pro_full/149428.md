词源：

"Pack rat" originated in the American West and refers to the wood rat (Neotoma cinerea), also known as the bushy-tailed wood rat or pack rat,  known for its habit of collecting and hoarding various objects, often shiny or metallic, in its nest.  The term was then applied to people with similar hoarding tendencies.
