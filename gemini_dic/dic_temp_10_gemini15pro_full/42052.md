**Etymology:**

From "cosy" (meaning comfortable and warm) + "up" (adverb indicating movement or closeness).  "Cosy" itself originates from Scots "cozie," possibly related to Old English "cosig" (victorious). The phrasal verb "cosy up" gained its figurative meaning of ingratiating oneself in the late 19th century.
