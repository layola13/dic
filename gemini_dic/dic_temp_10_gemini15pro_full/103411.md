USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
The JIT compiler translates bytecode into machine code.  JIT编译器将字节码翻译成机器码。
JIT compilation improves the execution speed of programs. JIT编译提高了程序的执行速度。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
The JIT compiler is optimizing the code for better performance. JIT编译器正在优化代码以获得更好的性能。
The program is running faster because the JIT is compiling the bytecode. 程序运行得更快，因为JIT正在编译字节码。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The JIT compiler has translated the frequently used methods. JIT编译器已经翻译了常用的方法。
The performance has improved significantly after the JIT kicked in. JIT启动后，性能显著提高。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The JIT compiler has been optimizing the code for the last few minutes. JIT编译器在过去几分钟里一直在优化代码。
The program has been running smoothly since the JIT started working. 自从JIT开始工作以来，程序一直运行得很流畅。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The JIT compiler translated the bytecode when the program started. 程序启动时，JIT编译器翻译了字节码。
The JIT improved the performance of the application significantly. JIT显著提高了应用程序的性能。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The JIT compiler was optimizing the code while the program was running. 程序运行时，JIT编译器正在优化代码。
The system was running slowly because the JIT was heavily loaded. 系统运行缓慢，因为JIT负载过重。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The JIT compiler had already translated the critical methods before the user noticed any improvement. 在用户注意到任何改进之前，JIT编译器已经翻译了关键方法。
The program had run much slower before the JIT was enabled. 在启用JIT之前，程序运行得慢得多。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The JIT compiler had been optimizing the code for several minutes before the performance improved noticeably. 在性能显著提高之前，JIT编译器已经优化代码几分钟了。
The system had been running sluggishly until the JIT finished compiling the core modules.  在JIT完成核心模块的编译之前，系统一直运行缓慢。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The JIT compiler will translate the bytecode when the program runs. 当程序运行时，JIT编译器将翻译字节码。
The new JIT will improve performance by a significant margin. 新的JIT将显著提高性能。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The JIT compiler will be optimizing the code in the background while the user interacts with the application. 当用户与应用程序交互时，JIT编译器将在后台优化代码。
The system will be running more efficiently with the new JIT implementation. 使用新的JIT实现，系统将运行得更高效。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the time the user launches the application, the JIT compiler will have already optimized the frequently used methods.  当用户启动应用程序时，JIT编译器将已经优化了常用的方法。
The program will have achieved peak performance after the JIT completes its optimization process. JIT完成优化过程后，程序将达到峰值性能。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The JIT compiler will have been optimizing the code for several hours by the end of the test run. 到测试运行结束时，JIT编译器将已经优化代码几个小时了。
The system will have been running at optimal speed because the JIT will have been continuously adapting to the workload. 系统将一直以最佳速度运行，因为JIT将一直在适应工作负载。
