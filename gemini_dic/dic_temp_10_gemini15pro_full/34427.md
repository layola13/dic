词源:  "Clauser" comes from the verb "clause," which means "to provide with a clause or clauses."  The suffix "-er" is added to form a noun indicating the person or thing performing the action. "Clause" itself originates from the Old French "clause" and ultimately from the Latin "clausa," meaning "a close, conclusion."
