PHRASE->
(Not applicable. "Moodier" is a comparative adjective and doesn't typically form set phrases.)


词源:  From "moody" + "-er" (comparative suffix). "Moody" comes from Middle English "modi," meaning "proud, arrogant," later evolving to its current meaning related to fluctuating moods.  来自 "moody" + "-er" （比较级后缀）。"Moody" 来自中古英语 "modi"，意思是“骄傲、傲慢”，后来演变成现在的意思，与情绪波动有关。
