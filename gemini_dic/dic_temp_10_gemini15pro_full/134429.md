Not in an irrational manner; in a way that is not unreasonable or illogical.

近义词: rationally, logically, reasonably, sanely
反义词: irrationally, illogically, unreasonably, insanely
词性: adverb

词源:  The prefix "non-" negates the meaning of the root word "irrational," which itself combines "ir-" (not) with "rational."  "Rational" ultimately derives from Latin "ratio" (reason).  "Non-" + "ir-" + "rational" + "-ly"
