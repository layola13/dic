ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Middle English *gasen, *gase, from *gas, a back-formation from gases, the plural of gas.  Gas itself was coined by the Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont, c. 1630, from Greek chaos "empty space, vast void," from PIE *gheu-, *gh(e)i- "to gape, yawn." The use of gases is the standard plural form of "gas."
