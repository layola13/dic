The word "denior" is not a recognized English word. It's likely a misspelling of "senior" or perhaps a less common, specialized term.  Since "denior" isn't a valid word, I can't provide a proper analysis for it. Instead, I'll offer an analysis of "senior."

senior:/ˈsiːniər/ | adj. n. |高级的，年长的； 资深的，地位较高的； 毕业班学生； 年长者| A senior citizen. 一位老年人。| senior member, elder, older | junior, younger | adjective, noun
