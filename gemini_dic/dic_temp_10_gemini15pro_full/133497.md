词源:  This word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "ferocious" (meaning "fiercely cruel or violent"), and then adding the suffix "-ness" to create a noun referring to the state or quality of being nonferocious.  "Ferocious" itself comes from the Latin "ferox" (meaning "fierce, wild, cruel").
