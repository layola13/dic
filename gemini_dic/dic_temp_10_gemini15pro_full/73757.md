"Forly" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regionalism, a newly coined word, or a proper noun (e.g., a company name).

If you can provide more context, like where you encountered the word, I might be able to offer more information.

Since I cannot analyze "forly," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "what":

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wʌt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. | 什么，多么 | Used to ask for information about something. | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？| Synonym: which, how | Antonym: N/A (interrogative words generally don't have antonyms) | Part of Speech: pronoun, determiner, adverb
