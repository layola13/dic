ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + compute (to calculate). The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", from Proto-Indo-European "*mei-" (to change, exchange). "Compute" comes from Latin "computare" (to count, sum up, reckon), from "com-" (together) + "putare" (to think, reckon).
