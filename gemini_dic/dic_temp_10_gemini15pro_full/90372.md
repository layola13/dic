词源: "How-to" is a compound adjective and adverb formed from the words "how" and "to".  "How-toers" is a relatively recent neologism formed by adding the suffix "-er" to the noun phrase "how-to", indicating a person who engages in how-to activities.  It likely gained popularity with the rise of online DIY and tutorial culture.
