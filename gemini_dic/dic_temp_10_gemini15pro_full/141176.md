oogonium:/oʊ.əˈɡoʊ.ni.əm/| n. |卵原细胞|An immature female reproductive cell that gives rise to primary oocytes by meiosis.  It is a diploid cell containing two complete sets of chromosomes. |The oogonium undergoes mitosis to produce more oogonia.|近义词:  precursor cell, germ cell|反义词: None (It's a specific cell type, not a concept with an opposite)|词性: Noun
