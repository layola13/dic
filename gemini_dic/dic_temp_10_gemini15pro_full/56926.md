Cognate with Scots *doith* (“does”), West Frisian *docht* (“does”), Dutch *doet* (“does”), Low German *deit* (“does”), German *tut* (“does”), Danish *gør* (“does”), Swedish *gör* (“does”), Icelandic *gerir* (“does”).

The word "doth" is archaic and rarely used in modern English.  Its modern equivalent is "does."  It is primarily found in older literature, particularly poetry and religious texts.
