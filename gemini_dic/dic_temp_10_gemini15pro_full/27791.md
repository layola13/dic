ETYMOLOGY->
From can (n.) + -ing. The noun "can" referring to a metal container originates from the Middle English "canne," borrowed from the Middle Dutch "kanne" and ultimately from the Latin "canna" meaning "reed, cane."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a gerund or present participle, indicating the action or process of using cans for preservation.
