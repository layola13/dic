apetalousness:/eɪˈpetələsnəs/
n.
无瓣花性；无花瓣
The state or quality of being apetalous; lacking petals.
The apetalousness of the wind-pollinated flowers was an adaptation to their environment. 这种风媒花的无瓣花性是对环境的一种适应。
近义词:petal-less, apetaly
反义词:petaliferous, polypetalous
词性:noun

Etymology:
From a- (without) + petal + -ous (having) + -ness (state of being). Ultimately from Greek *a- (without) + petalon (leaf, petal).
