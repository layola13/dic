ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *louten*, from Old Norse *lúta* ("to bend, stoop, bow"), from Proto-Germanic *lūtaną* ("to bend, bow"), from Proto-Indo-European *lewk- ("to bend, twist").  Cognates include German *leuchten* ("to shine"), Latin *lucere* ("to shine"), and Greek *λύκος* (*lykos*, "wolf," originally meaning "bender").  The connection with shining likely arose from the metaphorical bending of light rays.
