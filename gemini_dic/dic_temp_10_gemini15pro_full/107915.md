larvas:/ˈlɑːrvəz/ /ˈlɑːrviː/ | n. | 幼虫（复数）| The larval stage of a butterfly is called a caterpillar. 蝴蝶的幼虫阶段被称为毛毛虫。| 例句：The pond teemed with mosquito larvas. 池塘里满是蚊子幼虫。| 近义词：grubs, caterpillars, maggots | 反义词: adult, imago | 词性: 名词

Etymology: From Latin *larva* "ghost, mask, evil spirit, specter," probably from Etruscan, of unknown origin.  The biological sense ("immature insect, grub, caterpillar") developed later, perhaps influenced by the notion of an insect larva being "masked" or disguised in its immature form.
