bytecode:/ˈbaɪtkoʊd/| n.|字节码|Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed in compact numeric codes, constants, and references (often numeric addresses) which describe each operation and its operands. |The Java Virtual Machine executes bytecode.|近义词:intermediate code, object code|反义词:source code|noun

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Bytecode represents the compiled form of a program. = 字节码表示程序的编译形式。
