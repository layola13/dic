oolite:/ˈoʊəˌlaɪt/ | n. |鲕岩，鱼卵石|A sedimentary rock consisting of small, round grains (ooliths) cemented together.  These grains are formed by the concentric accretion of calcium carbonate around a nucleus, such as a shell fragment, in shallow marine environments.|The beach was covered in oolites, smooth and round like tiny eggs.|Synonyms: roe stone, egg stone|Antonyms:  (No direct antonym, perhaps consider rocks with different formation processes like shale or granite)|noun
