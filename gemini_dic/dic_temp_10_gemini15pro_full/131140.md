nonblocking:/ˌnɒnˈblɒkɪŋ/ (US) /ˌnɑːnˈblɑːkɪŋ/| adj.|非阻塞的|Not blocking; allowing other operations to proceed without waiting for completion.  This term is often used in computing and telecommunications to describe operations that don't halt the execution of other processes.|Example: Nonblocking sockets allow a server to handle multiple clients concurrently.  非阻塞套接字允许服务器同时处理多个客户端。|Synonym: asynchronous, concurrent|Antonym: blocking, synchronous|Adjective
