nonrefractively:/ˌnɒnriˈfræktɪvli/
adverb
非折射地
In a way that does not involve refraction (the bending of light).
The laser beam passed nonrefractively through the vacuum chamber. 激光束非折射地穿过真空室。
non-refractively
nonrefractingly

Etymology:
non- (prefix meaning "not") + refractive + -ly (adverb suffix)
From Latin refractus, past participle of refringere "to break up, break open," from re- "back" + frangere "to break."
