From earlier *niger*, from Spanish and Portuguese *negro* (“black”), from Latin *niger* (“black”). Cognate with French *nègre* (now considered archaic and offensive). The ending *-er* was added in English, possibly influenced by words like *singer* or *dancer*, creating a plural form. However, the singular form *nigger* is more commonly used, even when referring to multiple people.
