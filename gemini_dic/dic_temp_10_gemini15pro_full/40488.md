contristate (also spelled "contristated") is not a standard English word. It appears to be a rare or archaic form, possibly derived from the Latin "contristare" meaning "to sadden" or "make sorrowful."  While grammatically correct in its formation, it is not commonly used in modern English.  The more common words like "sad," "sorrowful," or "melancholy" are preferred.
