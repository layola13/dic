ETYMOLOGY->
From the Italian *busto* "torso, bust," from Old French *bust* "torso," ultimately from Latin *bustum* "a tomb, place for burning the dead." The sense shifted from "torso" to "sculpture of a torso" and then broadened to include the chest area. The slang meanings relating to arrest and failure likely developed from the idea of something being "broken" or "destroyed."
