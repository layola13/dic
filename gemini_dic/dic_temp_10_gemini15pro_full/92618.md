iasu is not a recognized English word.  It's possible you meant "was you" which is non-standard English, or perhaps a word from another language.  Since there's no valid English word "iasu," I can't provide a standard analysis.

However, if you meant *what*, here's the analysis:

what: /wɒt/ (UK), /wɑːt/ (US) | pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么 | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？|  What a beautiful day! 多么美好的一天！ | synonyms: which, how | antonyms:  (No direct antonyms for "what") | pronoun, determiner, adverb, interjection
