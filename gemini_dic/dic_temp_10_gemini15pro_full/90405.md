注意事项:  "hows" itself isn't commonly used in formal writing. It's more prevalent in informal spoken or written communication.  While "hows" as a standalone word isn't standard English, its usage as a contraction is common and accepted in informal contexts.  Avoid using it in formal writing or situations.
