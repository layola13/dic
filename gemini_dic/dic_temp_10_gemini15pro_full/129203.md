ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *nobler*, comparative of *noble*, from Old French *noble*, from Latin *nobilis* (“knowable, famous, illustrious, high-born, excellent”), from *nosco* (“I get to know”).  The sense development was from "well-known, renowned" to "of high social rank" to "possessing excellent qualities."
