ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *dȳfan, from Proto-Germanic *dūbijaną, from Proto-Indo-European *dʰewb- (“deep, hollow”). Cognate with Old Saxon dūfian (“to dive, dip, sink”), Old Norse dýfa (“to dip, immerse”), Dutch duiken (“to dive, stoop”), German taufen (“to baptize”). The original meaning was "to dip, immerse," which developed into the sense of plunging into water headfirst.  The sense of a sudden drop or decrease is a figurative extension of the diving motion.
