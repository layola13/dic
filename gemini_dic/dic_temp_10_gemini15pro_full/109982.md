词源: From French *libertin*, from Latin *lībbertīnus* "freedman," also "one who acts like a freedman, unrestrained person."  Originally referred to freed slaves, who, having escaped the constraints of slavery, were sometimes perceived as lacking moral restraint.  The meaning evolved over time to denote someone who is free from moral or social constraints, particularly in sexual matters.
