nondeductively:/ˌnɑːndɪˈdʌktɪvli/
adverb|非演绎地|In a way that does not involve deduction; not by deduction.  Reasoning from observations or experiences to probable conclusions rather than from self-evident principles.|The conclusion was reached nondeductively, based on the available evidence.|近义词：inductively, empirically|反义词：deductively|词性: adverb

词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "deductive" (adjective meaning "reasoning from general principles to specific conclusions") + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Deductive" ultimately comes from the Latin "deducere" meaning "to lead down" or "to derive."
