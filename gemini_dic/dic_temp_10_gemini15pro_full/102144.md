注意事项:  *iss* itself isn't a word.  This analysis breaks down the components "what," "is," and the plural suffix "-s."  Since *what*, *is*, and *-s* are all extremely common, the examples are intended to be clear and representative rather than exhaustive.  The pronunciation of the suffix "-s" is context-dependent and changes based on the final sound of the base word. It can be pronounced /s/, /z/, or /ɪz/.
