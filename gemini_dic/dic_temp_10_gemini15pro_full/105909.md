* "kitu" is a Swahili word, and this analysis applies to its usage in that language. It may not be a recognized word in English.
* The pronunciation provided is an approximation based on Swahili phonetics.
* While "nothing" is provided as an antonym, it doesn't perfectly capture the opposite of a physical object.  Perhaps "immateriality" or "absence of things" would be more accurate, but these are not single words.
