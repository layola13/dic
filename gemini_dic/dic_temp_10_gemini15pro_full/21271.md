注意事项:  "bloodies" is an informal plural of "bloody mary."  When referring to blood or violence, "bloody" is generally used as an adjective, not a noun.  Therefore, "bloodies" in this context is less common and might be considered slightly awkward or informal.  "Bloody events" or "instances of bloodshed" are more typical phrasing.
