词源：
From Middle English *lewed, from Old English lǣwede (“lay, not clerical; unlearned, ignorant; of the laity, secular”), from Proto-Germanic *laiwaz (“layman”), from Proto-Indo-European *leh₂w- (“left; remaining; lay, secular”). Cognate with Old Frisian lēwede (“layman”), Dutch leeuw (“layman”), German Laie (“layman”), Old Norse leikr (“play, sport, dance”), Swedish lek (“play”), Gothic 𐌻𐌰𐌹𐍅𐍃 (laiws, “layman”). More at lay.  The semantic development from "ignorant" to "badly behaved" to "sexually unrestrained" is paralleled by villain.
