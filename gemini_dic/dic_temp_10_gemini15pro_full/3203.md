近义词:pretentiously, artificially, theatrically
反义词:naturally, genuinely, sincerely
词性:adverb

词源:
From affect + -ed + -ly.  "Affect" comes from the Latin "afficere," meaning "to act on, influence."  The "-ed" suffix creates the past participle (used here as an adjective), and the "-ly" suffix transforms it into an adverb.
