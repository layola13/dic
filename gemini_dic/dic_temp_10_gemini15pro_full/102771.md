japans:/dʒəˈpænz/ | n. | 日本（不常用复数形式）|  While "japans" is grammatically possible as a plural noun, it's rarely used and generally considered incorrect. "Japan" itself is typically used to refer to the country, even in contexts where other countries might take a plural form.  It may appear in historical contexts,  referring to multiple Japanese islands or fiefdoms, or in very niche situations like discussing different types of lacquerware specifically identified as "japans."|  (Example is contrived due to rarity of usage) The merchant displayed various japans, each with a unique finish. 商人展示了各种各样的日本漆器，每一种都有独特的表面处理。 | Synonym:  (Singular) Japan, Nippon | Antonym: N/A | Noun
