过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The blastocoele had formed before gastrulation began. = 在原肠胚形成开始之前，囊胚腔已经形成。
The cells had already migrated into the blastocoele. = 细胞已经迁移到囊胚腔中。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The blastocoele had been expanding for several hours. = 囊胚腔已经扩张了几个小时。
The cells had been migrating into the blastocoele before the process was interrupted. = 在这个过程被中断之前，细胞一直在迁移到囊胚腔中。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The blastocoele will form in the next stage of development. = 囊胚腔将在下一个发育阶段形成。
The blastocoele will be crucial for further development. = 囊胚腔对于进一步发育至关重要。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The blastocoele will be expanding as the embryo continues to develop. = 随着胚胎继续发育，囊胚腔将继续扩张。
The cells will be migrating into the blastocoele. = 细胞将迁移到囊胚腔中。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the week, the blastocoele will have fully formed. = 到本周末，囊胚腔将完全形成。
The cells will have migrated into the blastocoele. = 细胞将迁移到囊胚腔中。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next week, the blastocoele will have been expanding for several days. = 到下周，囊胚腔将已经扩张了几天。
The cells will have been migrating into the blastocoele for a significant period. = 细胞将已经迁移到囊胚腔中很长一段时间。

PHRASE->
formation of the blastocoele = 囊胚腔的形成
blastocoele fluid = 囊胚腔液
blastocoele cavity = 囊胚腔（与blastocoele同义）
expansion of the blastocoele = 囊胚腔的扩张
role of the blastocoele in gastrulation = 囊胚腔在原肠胚形成中的作用
