注意事项:  The term "gipsy" is considered by many to be a derogatory slur.  "Roma" or "Romany" are the preferred terms.  While "gipsyisms" isn't inherently offensive,  it's important to be sensitive to the potential for misinterpretation and consider using  "Roma customs" or "Romani traditions" instead.
