ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *halten*, from Old English *healtian* (“to limp, be lame”), from Proto-Germanic *haltjaną* (“to be lame, limp”), from Proto-Indo-European *kel- (“crooked, bent”). Related to Old High German *haltan* (“to hold, keep, guard, observe”).  Doublet of *hold*.  The sense development is from "limp" to "stop" due to the association of limping with stopping or pausing.
