词源: "Cuute" is a modern slang variation of "cute," whose origins trace back to the 18th century. It's a shortened form of "acute," meaning sharp or clever.  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to something attractive or pleasing, particularly in a delicate or dainty way. The doubling of the "u" in "cuute" is a recent online trend used for emphasis, similar to how people might write "sooo cute."
