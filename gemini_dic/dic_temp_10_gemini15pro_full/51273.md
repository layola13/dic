词源: From Latin *desultorius* "leaping down, pertaining to a dismounted rider, superficial," from *desilire* "to leap down, alight," from *de-* "down" + *salire* "to leap."  Originally referred to the irregular movements of a rider who leaps from one horse to another.  The sense of "superficial" arose from the notion of a rider not staying long on any one horse, and the modern meaning of "lacking a plan" developed from this.
