adiabatic:/ˌeɪdiəˈbætɪk/| adj.|绝热的，断热的|Relating to or denoting a process or condition in which heat does not enter or leave the system concerned.|The adiabatic expansion of the gas caused it to cool. 气体的绝热膨胀导致其冷却。

An adiabatic process is used in refrigeration. 绝热过程用于制冷。|近义词：insulated, heat-insulating|反义词：diathermic, isothermal|词性:形容词


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *adiabatos*  "impassable," from *a-* "not" + *diabatos* "passable," from *diabainein* "to go through," from *dia-* "through" + *bainein* "to go."  The scientific sense of "without gain or loss of heat" was first used in 1816 by French physicist and engineer Sadi Carnot.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The adiabatic process is crucial in thermodynamics. = 绝热过程在热力学中至关重要。
An adiabatic wall prevents heat transfer. = 绝热壁防止热传递。

一般过去时:
The system was assumed to be adiabatic. = 假设系统是绝热的。
The experiment was performed under adiabatic conditions. = 实验是在绝热条件下进行的。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied adiabatic processes for centuries. = 科学家们几个世纪以来一直在研究绝热过程。
The engineer has designed an adiabatic chamber for the experiment. = 工程师为实验设计了一个绝热室。

过去完成时:
The gas had expanded adiabatically before the measurement was taken. = 在测量之前，气体已经绝热膨胀。
The researchers had assumed adiabatic conditions before starting the experiment. = 研究人员在开始实验之前假设了绝热条件。

将来时:
The system will be treated as adiabatic in the simulation. = 在模拟中，该系统将被视为绝热的。
The engineer will design an adiabatic container for the substance. = 工程师将为该物质设计一个绝热容器。

虚拟语气:
If the process were adiabatic, the temperature change would be different. = 如果过程是绝热的，温度变化将会有所不同。
I wish the system was truly adiabatic. = 我希望系统是真正绝热的。

被动语态:
Adiabatic conditions are often assumed in theoretical calculations. = 理论计算中通常假设绝热条件。
The gas is compressed adiabatically in this step. = 在此步骤中气体被绝热压缩。

疑问句:
Is this process adiabatic? = 这个过程是绝热的么？
Why are adiabatic conditions important in this experiment? = 为什么绝热条件在这个实验中很重要？

否定句:
The process is not adiabatic. = 这个过程不是绝热的。
The container is not perfectly adiabatic. = 容器并非完全绝热。


PHRASE->
adiabatic process = 绝热过程
adiabatic expansion = 绝热膨胀
