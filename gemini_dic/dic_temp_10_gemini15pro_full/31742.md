Etymology:  A blend of "cheap" and "skate," possibly influenced by the notion of skates being a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. "Cheap" has its origins in Old English "ceap" meaning "bargain," while "skate" comes from Old Norse "skata." The combined term emerged in the late 19th century American English.
