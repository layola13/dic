Etymology->

The origin of "as fit as a fiddle" is uncertain. One theory suggests that "fit" originally meant "suitable" or "appropriate," and a fiddle in good condition was considered suitable for playing. Another theory proposes a connection to the Middle Dutch word "vedel," referring to both a stringed instrument and a lively dance. Regardless of the exact origin, the phrase has been in use since the 16th century.
