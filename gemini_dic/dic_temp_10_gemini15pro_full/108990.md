词源:  "Left" and "centre" in political terms refer to seating arrangements in legislative assemblies, with those favoring more radical change traditionally sitting to the left of the presiding officer and those favoring the status quo to the right.  "Centre" represents the moderate or middle ground.  "Left-of-centre" thus indicates a position somewhat left of the moderate position, implying progressive or liberal views.
