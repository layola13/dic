ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *adjutrix*, feminine form of *adjutor* ("helper"), from *adjutare* ("to help"), from *ad-* ("to") + *juvare* ("to help").

USAGE->
This word is quite archaic and rarely used in modern English. It may occasionally be encountered in historical or literary contexts.  Because it is so rarely used, providing specific examples for various tenses and grammatical constructions would be creating artificial and unlikely examples.  It's better to understand its general meaning and context.

PHRASE->
While specific phrases with "adjutrix" are uncommon due to its infrequent usage, it could theoretically be used in phrases similar to those used with "assistant" or "aide":

the adjutrix to the general = 将军的副官
a trusted adjutrix = 一位值得信赖的助手
her duties as adjutrix = 她作为助手的职责
the adjutrix's advice = 副官的建议
seeking an adjutrix = 寻找一位助手
