ferromagnetically:/ˌfɛroʊmæɡˈnɛtɪkli/| adv.|铁磁性地|In a way that exhibits ferromagnetism; relating to or characteristic of a ferromagnet.  This describes how something behaves magnetically, not the material itself.|The material reacted ferromagnetically to the applied field.  这种材料对施加的磁场表现出铁磁性。|
The compass needle aligned ferromagnetically with the Earth's magnetic field. 指南针的指针与地球磁场铁磁性地对齐。|近义词:magnetically|反义词:diamagnetically, paramagnetically|词性:副词

Etymology:

From ferromagnetic + -ly.  "Ferromagnetic" comes from "ferro-" (iron, relating to iron) + "magnetic". The "ferro-" part ultimately derives from Latin "ferrum" (iron). "-ly" is a suffix used to form adverbs.
