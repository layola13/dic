overscutched:/ˌoʊvərˈskʌtʃt/ | adj. | 过度鞭打的；过度苛求的；过度紧张的 | Overworked, overstrained, or excessively driven; worn out.

The overscutched horse collapsed just before the finish line.  这匹过度鞭打的马在终点线前倒下了。 | 近义词：overworked, exhausted, stressed, strained, burnt out | 反义词: rested, relaxed, refreshed | 词性:形容词

Etymology:  From 'over' + 'scutch', where 'scutch' means to beat or whip (flax, hemp, etc.) to separate the fibers.  The sense of overworking or overdriving is an extension of this original meaning.  由“over”+“scutch”组成，其中“scutch”的意思是敲打或鞭打（亚麻、大麻等）以分离纤维。过度工作或过度驱动的含义是此原始含义的延伸。
