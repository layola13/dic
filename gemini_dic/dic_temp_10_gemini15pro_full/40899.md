词源:  Compound of cool + down.  "Cool" in the sense of "to become or cause to become less hot," from Old English col, from Proto-Germanic *kala- (source also of Old Norse kala "to freeze," Dutch koel "cool," German kühl "cool"). "Down" in the sense of "towards a lower or usual level," from Old English of dune "from the hill," from Proto-Germanic *dunam (source also of Old Frisian dun, Old Saxon duna, Old High German duna "hill, dune," German Düne "dune"), from PIE *dheu- "dust, vapor, smoke."  The combined meaning of "cool-down" emerges in the mid-20th century.
