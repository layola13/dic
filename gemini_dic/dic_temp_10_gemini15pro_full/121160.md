Etymology:
From mis- + devotion.  "Mis-" is a prefix of Old English and Germanic origin meaning "wrong," "bad," "wrongly," "astray," " amiss." "Devotion" comes from Old French "devotion," from Late Latin "devotionem" meaning "a setting apart, dedication," from past participle stem of "devovere"  meaning "to vow, dedicate, devote," from "de" meaning "down, away from" + "vovere" meaning "to vow, dedicate."
