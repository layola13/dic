注意事项:  Since "flak's" isn't a common standalone word, these examples are contrived to illustrate potential usage within different tenses.  It's more natural to use "flak" directly or rephrase the sentence entirely. For instance, instead of "The general receives the flak's brunt," it's more idiomatic to say "The general receives the brunt of the flak" or "The general is heavily criticized."
