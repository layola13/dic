词源: "Chee" is a non-standard, often informal or dialectal spelling of "cheese."  The word "cheese" itself comes from Old English *ċēse (attested only in compounds), from West Germanic *kāsī (source also of West Frisian tsiis, Dutch kaas, German Käse), from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *kazus. Ultimately, the origin is thought to be from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root *kwat-, meaning "to ferment, become sour."
