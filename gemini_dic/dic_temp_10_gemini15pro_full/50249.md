dependent-variables:/dɪˈpɛndənt ˈvɛəriəblz/ | n. | 因变量，应变量 |  A variable whose value depends on that of another.  In an experiment, the dependent variable is the variable being tested and measured. It is "dependent" on the independent variable. | The scientists measured the plant's growth (dependent variable) in response to different amounts of fertilizer (independent variable). 科学家们测量了植物的生长（因变量）以响应不同量的肥料（独立变量）。 | outcome variable, response variable | independent variable | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From dependent + variable. "Dependent" traces back to the Latin "dependēns," meaning "hanging down from," suggesting reliance or contingency. "Variable" stems from the Latin "variābilis," meaning "changeable," highlighting the fluctuating nature of the quantity.
