词源:  The origin of "ditsy" is uncertain, but it's thought to be related to "dizzy" and may have emerged in American slang in the mid-20th century.  It likely evolved from the feeling of lightheadedness and slight confusion associated with dizziness, extending to describe a scatterbrained or silly personality.
