gaseously:/ˈɡeɪsiəsli/ | adv. | 气态地；以气体形式 | In the upper atmosphere, water exists gaseously. |  Water vapor exists gaseously in the air. 水蒸气以气态形式存在于空气中。| 近义词: vaporously, aeriformly | 反义词: liquidly, solidly | 词性: 副词

词源:  From "gaseous" + "-ly". "Gaseous" comes from "gas" + "-eous". "Gas" is from the Dutch word "gas," coined by the Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont, perhaps influenced by the Greek word "khaos" meaning "void" or "chaos."

PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Gaseously" is an adverb and doesn't typically form set phrases.  It modifies verbs and describes *how* something exists or acts in a gaseous state, rather than forming noun phrases or idiomatic expressions.
