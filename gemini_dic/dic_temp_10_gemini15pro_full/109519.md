ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *lēsan, from Proto-Germanic *lēzaną, from Proto-Indo-European *leys-.  Cognate with Old Frisian lēsa (“to collect”), Middle Dutch lesen (“to gather, glean”), German lesen (“to read, gather”).  The original meaning was "to gather, collect," which evolved to "read" in German.  In English, the word retains the older meaning of gathering, specifically gleaning.
