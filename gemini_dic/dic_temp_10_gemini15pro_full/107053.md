lacturamic: /læktjʊˈræmɪk/
adjective
乳尿的; 与乳尿有关的
Relating to or characterized by lactamuria, the presence of lactic acid in the urine.
Lacturamic conditions can indicate underlying metabolic issues. 乳尿症状可能表明潜在的代谢问题。
This test checks for lacturamic compounds. 这个测试检查乳尿化合物。
近义词:  (No close synonyms exist.  Potentially related terms based on context might include "metabolic," "renal," or terms related to specific conditions that cause lactamuria)
反义词: (No direct antonym.  The absence of lactamuria would be implied by "normal urine composition.")
词性: adjective


Etymology:
"lact-" from Latin "lac, lactis" meaning milk (referring to lactic acid, a byproduct of glucose metabolism)
"-ur-" from Greek "ouron" meaning urine
"-amic" a suffix forming adjectives, meaning pertaining to or related to.  The word is likely a modern formation.
