PHRASE->
(While "mote's" itself isn't commonly used in phrases, "mote" is sometimes used figuratively, but even these are relatively rare.  Here are a few possibilities playing on the idea of a small flaw):

search for the mote in someone's eye = 寻找某人眼中的刺 (Focusing on a small flaw while ignoring larger ones)
a mote of doubt/uncertainty = 一丝怀疑/不确定


注意事项:

"Mote's" is not a commonly used word. It's simply the possessive form of "mote," which is already quite archaic.  In most cases, simply using "mote" or rephrasing the sentence would be more natural.
