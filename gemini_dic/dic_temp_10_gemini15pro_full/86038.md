用法说明:
"Healthfulnesses" is the plural form of "healthfulness,"  referring to the quality or state of being healthful. It's a less common word compared to "healthfulness," which is already less common than "health benefits" or similar phrases.  While grammatically correct, it can sound a bit awkward in modern usage. It's often more natural to rephrase using simpler vocabulary. For example, instead of "the healthfulnesses of various diets," one might say "the health benefits of various diets" or "how healthy various diets are."
