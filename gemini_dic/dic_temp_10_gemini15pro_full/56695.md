词源：From Old English *dēman "to judge, deem," from Proto-Germanic *dōmijaną (source also of Old Saxon dōmian, Old Frisian dēma, Old High German tuomen, German tümen, Old Norse dæma "to judge"), from PIE root *dhe- "to set, put, do."  The original sense was "judged, sentenced," especially to death or punishment.  The modern sense of "fated to an unhappy destiny" developed from this.
