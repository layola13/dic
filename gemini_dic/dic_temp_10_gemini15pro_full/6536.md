amygdaloidal: /əˌmɪɡdəˈlɔɪdəl/ | adj. | 杏仁状的；多孔状的 | Containing or resembling amygdules (small, rounded cavities in a rock filled with secondary minerals). | The amygdaloidal basalt had numerous cavities filled with zeolites.  这块杏仁状玄武岩有许多填充着沸石的空洞。

The geologist identified the rock as an amygdaloidal andesite. 地质学家将这块岩石鉴定为杏仁状安山岩。 | 近义词: vesicular, porous | 反义词: compact, dense | 词性: adjective

词源: From amygdule + -oidal. Amygdule comes from the Greek word amygdalē, meaning "almond," referring to the shape of the cavities.
