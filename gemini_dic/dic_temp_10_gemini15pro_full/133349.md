nonextensivenesses:/ˌnɒnɪkstɛnsɪvnəsɪz/
|n.|非广延性|The state or quality of not being extensive; the lack of extensiveness.  Specifically used in physics and thermodynamics to describe systems where the entropy is not additive.  |The nonextensivenesses of the systems under consideration led to unexpected results.  这些被考虑的系统的非广延性导致了意想不到的结果。|Near synonyms: non-additivity, non-extensivity|Antonyms: extensiveness, additivity|noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From "nonextensive" + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality).  "Nonextensive" is formed from "non-" (prefix indicating negation) + "extensive" (from Latin "extensus," past participle of "extendere" - to stretch out).
