gasteromycetes:/ˌɡæstərəˈmaɪsiːtiːz/| n. |腹菌纲|A class of fungi, now considered paraphyletic, whose spores are produced internally in a fruiting body, often enclosed by a peridium, rather than on an exposed surface.  These fruiting bodies often have distinctive shapes and mechanisms for spore dispersal.|Puffballs and earthstars are examples of gasteromycetes. 马勃和地星是腹菌纲的例子。|Synonyms: Gastromycetes, stomach fungi|Antonyms:  N/A (No single antonym for a taxonomic group)|noun
