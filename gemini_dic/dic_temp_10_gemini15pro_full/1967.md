activations:/ˌæktɪˈveɪʃənz/| n.|激活，启动，活化|The process of making something active or operative.  Specifically, in the context of neural networks, it refers to the outputs of nodes in a network after a set of inputs has been processed.  These outputs determine which nodes in the next layer will fire.|The software requires product activation before use.  该软件在使用前需要产品激活。

The activations of the neurons in the hidden layer are then passed to the output layer.  隐藏层中神经元的激活随后被传递到输出层。|近义词：triggers, stimulation, initiation|反义词: deactivation, suppression|词性:noun
