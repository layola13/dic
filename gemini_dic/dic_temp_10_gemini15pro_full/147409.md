overnormalizations:/ˌoʊvərˌnɔːrmələˈzeɪʃənz/| n. |过度规范化|The act of applying normalization rules or patterns excessively, often leading to incorrect or unnatural results.|Database overnormalizations can lead to performance issues. 数据库的过度规范化会导致性能问题。|Normalization often involves simplifying or reducing data to a standard format, which can be helpful in organizing and analyzing large datasets. However, if these normalization rules are applied too rigidly or extensively, it can result in the loss of important information or create unnecessary complexity.  For example, in linguistics, overnormalization might involve applying grammatical rules too strictly, leading to incorrect word forms.|over-application, excessive normalization|under-normalization|noun
