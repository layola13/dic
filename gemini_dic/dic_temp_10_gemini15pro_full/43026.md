注意事项:

“Cowen” is an archaic or dialectal word for "cow."  While grammatically correct in these examples, using "cow" is generally preferred in modern English.  The word "cowen" itself derives from Middle English and is related to the Old English "cū."  Its decline in usage makes it less common than the simpler term "cow."
