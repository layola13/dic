注意事项：

*  "Gayness's" is grammatically correct, but its use can sound awkward.  "The gayness of the celebration" or a similar construction is often preferred.  Using possessive forms with abstract nouns is less common.  Consider rephrasing for clearer communication.
*  This word might be considered sensitive by some. Be mindful of your audience and context when using it.
