注意事项:

Although grammatically correct, the use of "English's" is less common than "English" followed by a noun or using "of English". For example, "English literature" is preferred over "English's literature."  Using "English's" might sound slightly awkward or archaic in modern usage.  Consider using alternatives unless a specific stylistic effect is intended.
