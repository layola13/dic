PHRASE->
N/A - "Artiest" is not commonly used in phrases.  It is typically used as a standalone adjective.


词源: artiest 源自 artist（艺术家）, 加上 -est 后缀构成最高级。  The suffix "-est" is used to form the superlative degree of adjectives, meaning "most."  The word "artist" itself comes from Old French "artiste" and ultimately from Latin "ars," meaning "art" or "skill."
