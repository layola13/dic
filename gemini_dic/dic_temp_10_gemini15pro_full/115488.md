The word "manurement" appears to be a misspelling of "manure" or perhaps a blend of "manure" and "measurement".  Since the prompt requests information on "manurement", I'll address both possibilities.

**If the intended word is "manure":**

manure: /məˈnʊr/ | n. vt.| 肥料，粪肥；施肥于 |  Animal dung used for fertilizing land. |  The farmer spread manure on the fields. 农民在地里施肥。 | synonyms: fertilizer, dung, compost | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "barrenness" regarding the effect on land) | noun, verb

**If "manurement" is intended to signify some kind of measurement related to manure:**

manurement (non-standard): /məˈnʊrmənt/ | n. | 肥料测量，粪肥测量 (非标准用法) | A hypothetical measurement related to the quantity, quality, or application of manure.  | There’s no standard unit for manurement, so farmers use various methods. 没有标准的肥料测量单位，所以农民使用各种方法。 | synonyms: (No direct synonyms,  perhaps "fertilizer analysis," "manure assessment") | antonyms: N/A | noun

This word isn't recognized in standard dictionaries. Its usage would follow the same grammatical patterns as "measurement."  You would need to provide context and define its specific meaning for clarity.  It's recommended to use existing terminology like "manure analysis" or "fertilizer application rate" for precise communication.
