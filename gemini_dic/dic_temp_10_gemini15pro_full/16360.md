Etymology: From "barbed" + "-ness". "Barbed" comes from the Old French "barbel" (beard, wattle, barbel of a fish), which ultimately derives from the Late Latin "barbula," diminutive of "barba" (beard).  The suffix "-ness" is a common Old English suffix used to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
