ETYMOLOGY->
From incomparable + -ness + -es.  "Incomparable" comes from the late Middle English, borrowed from the Old French "incomparable," ultimately deriving from the Latin "incomparabilis," formed from "in-" (not) + "comparabilis" (comparable), which itself comes from "comparare" (to compare). The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  The suffix "-es" creates the plural form.
