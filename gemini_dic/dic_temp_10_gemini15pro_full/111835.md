ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "log," which originally meant "to enter into a logbook" and later extended to mean "to cut down trees for timber."  "Log" comes from the Old Norse word "lag," meaning "layer" or "trunk of a tree."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a gerund, and the apostrophe-s indicates possession.  Therefore, "logging's" literally means "belonging to logging" or "of logging."
