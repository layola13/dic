PHRASE->
(This word is not typically used in common phrases.  It's primarily a descriptive adjective.)


词源：
From inter- + curl.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among," and "curl" refers to the act of forming into a curved or spiral shape.  Therefore, "intercurling" literally means "curling between or among each other."
