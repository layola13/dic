metacenter:/ˈmetəˌsentər/| n. |稳心; 定倾中心|The point of intersection of the vertical line through the center of buoyancy of a floating body when upright and the vertical line through the new center of buoyancy when the body is tilted.  It is the point above which the center of gravity must lie for stable equilibrium.|The ship's metacenter is crucial for its stability. 这艘船的稳心对其稳定性至关重要。|Synonyms: center of stability|Antonyms: N/A|noun
