nonassociatively:/ˌnɒnəˈsəʊʃiətɪvli/ | adv. | 非结合地 | In a nonassociative manner; not associative.  This term is typically used in mathematics, particularly in the context of algebraic operations where the order of operations matters. | The operation is defined nonassociatively, meaning (a * b) * c is not necessarily equal to a * (b * c).  这个运算是被非结合地定义的，意味着 (a * b) * c 不一定等于 a * (b * c). |  The cross product of vectors is nonassociative. 向量的外积是非结合的。 | non-commutative | associative | adverb
