ETYMOLOGY->
From impressionist + -ic + -ally.  "Impressionist" refers to a style of painting and other art forms that seeks to capture a fleeting impression or feeling.  The suffix "-ic" forms an adjective, and "-ally" turns it into an adverb.  Ultimately derived from the Latin "impressio" meaning a pressing into or upon.
