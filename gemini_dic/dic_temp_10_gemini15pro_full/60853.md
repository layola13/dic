electroviscosity:/ɪˌlɛktroʊvɪsˈkɒsɪti/ | n. | 电粘性 | The increase in viscosity of a fluid caused by an applied electric field.  This phenomenon occurs primarily in colloidal suspensions or solutions of macromolecules. | The electroviscosity of the fluid increased dramatically when the electric field was applied. 电场施加后，流体的电粘性急剧增加。

The researchers measured the electroviscosity of the ferrofluid. 研究人员测量了铁磁流体的电粘性。 | 近义词: apparent viscosity (in some contexts) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology: electro- (from Greek ἤλεκτρον, ēlektron, "amber", referring to electrical phenomena) + viscosity (from Late Latin viscositas, "stickiness", from viscosus, "sticky")
