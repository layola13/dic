ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *augustus* ("venerable, majestic"), ultimately from *augere* ("to increase").  The term is associated with the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus (63 BC – AD 14), a period marked by peace and prosperity, and a flourishing of arts and literature, hence the connotations of grandeur and classicism.
