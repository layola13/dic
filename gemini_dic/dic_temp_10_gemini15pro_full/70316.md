ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *fief, *fieu, from Frankish *fehu "cattle, property," from Proto-Germanic *fehu "cattle, wealth."  Cognate with Old English feoh "cattle, money, property," German Vieh "cattle," Latin pecus "cattle," and Sanskrit paśu- "cattle."  The semantic shift from "cattle" to "land" occurred because cattle were the primary form of wealth and land was valued for its ability to support livestock.
