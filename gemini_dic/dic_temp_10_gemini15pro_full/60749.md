electrodynamicses: /ɪˌlektroʊdaɪˈnæmɪksɪz/ | n. | 电动力学 |  The study of the interaction of electric and magnetic fields with matter.  It encompasses both electric and magnetic phenomena and their interrelationship. |  His research focuses on the electrodynamicses of plasmas. 他的研究重点是等离子体的电动力学。| synonyms: electromagnetism | antonyms: (No direct antonym for a scientific field of study) | noun

electrodynamics: /ɪˌlektroʊdaɪˈnæmɪks/ | n. | 电动力学 |  The study of the interaction of electric and magnetic fields with matter.  It encompasses both electric and magnetic phenomena and their interrelationship. |  Classical electrodynamics explains the behavior of electromagnetic radiation. 经典电动力学解释了电磁辐射的行为。| synonyms: electromagnetism | antonyms: (No direct antonym for a scientific field of study) | noun


*Note:*  "Electrodynamicses" is grammatically incorrect. The correct plural form, if truly needing to refer to multiple distinct systems or theories of electrodynamics, would be "electrodynamics."  However,  "electrodynamics" itself is usually treated as a singular, uncountable noun.
