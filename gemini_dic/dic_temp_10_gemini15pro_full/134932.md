nonmyelinated:/ˌnɒnˈmaɪɪlɪneɪtɪd/ /ˌnɑːnˈmaɪəlɪneɪtɪd/ | adj. | 无髓鞘的 | Not covered with or enclosed in a myelin sheath.  Myelin sheaths allow nerve impulses to travel more quickly. |  Nonmyelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses more slowly. 无髓神经纤维传导冲动更慢。| 近义词: unmyelinated | 反义词: myelinated | 词性: 形容词

词源: non- + myelinated.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "myelinated" refers to being covered in a myelin sheath, derived from "myelin," which refers to the fatty insulating sheath around many nerve fibers.
