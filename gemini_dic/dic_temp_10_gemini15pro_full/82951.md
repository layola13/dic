The word "gundelet" does not appear to be a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended to type a different word.  Could you be thinking of "gunwale," "gunnel," or another word?
* **A regionalism or slang term:** It's possible this word is used in a very specific dialect or community.
* **A neologism:**  Someone might have coined this word recently.
* **A proper noun:**  Though less likely, it could be a name of a person, place, or thing.


Since "gundelet" isn't a standard word, I cannot provide the requested information in the specified format.  However, if you can clarify the intended word, I'd be happy to help.
