nonparentally:/ˌnɒn.pəˈrɛntəli/ | adv. | 非亲本地，非亲代地 |  In genetics, it refers to the inheritance of genetic material in a manner that deviates from the typical parent-to-offspring transmission, such as through horizontal gene transfer. |  The gene was transferred nonparentally through a viral vector.  该基因通过病毒载体非亲本地转移。| Synonym:  extrachromosomally, horizontally (in genetics) | Antonym: parentally, sexually (in genetics)|词性:副词
