PHRASE->
(While "kum" is a relatively uncommon word, especially outside of Scottish dialect, creating phrases using it feels forced and unnatural.  Therefore, instead of providing phrases with "kum", I am providing example phrases using the more common synonym "soot".)

The chimney was blackened with soot. 烟囱被煤烟熏黑了。
The fire left a layer of soot on everything. 火在所有东西上都留下了一层煤烟。
He brushed the soot off his clothes. 他把衣服上的煤烟刷掉。
The soot from the factory polluted the air. 工厂排放的煤烟污染了空气。
The walls were covered in a thick layer of soot. 墙壁上覆盖着一层厚厚的煤烟。


注意事项:
The word "kum" is primarily used in Scottish dialect and is not commonly used in other forms of English.  Its meaning is equivalent to "come".  The alternative meaning as "soot" or "coal dust" is also less common.
