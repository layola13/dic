词源: humorless (缺乏幽默的) + -ly (副词后缀)  Ultimately from Latin "umor" (moisture, fluid). The word "humor" originally referred to the four bodily fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) believed to determine a person's temperament.  Over time, it evolved to mean "temperament" and then "a comical quality."
