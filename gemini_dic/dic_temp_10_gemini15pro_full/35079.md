注意事项:

* "Closuring" is not a standard English word. While grammatically correct as a present participle of the verb "to close", it is rarely used as a noun. "Closure" is the more common noun form.  "Closing" is also used as a noun and is more common in business contexts (e.g., the closing of a deal).

* In the provided examples, "closure" or "closing" would often be more natural and idiomatic choices than "closuring".  I have used "closuring" as requested, but be aware of its uncommon usage.
