icarus:/ˈɪkərəs/| n.|伊卡洛斯; 妄自尊大的人|In Greek mythology, Icarus is the son of Daedalus who dared to fly too near the sun on wings of feathers and wax. Daedalus had been imprisoned by King Minos of Crete within the walls of his own invention, the Labyrinth. But the great craftsman's genius would not suffer captivity. He made two pairs of wings by adhering feathers to a wooden framework with wax. Giving one pair to his son, he cautioned him that flying too near the sun would melt the wax, and flying too near the sea would dampen the feathers. But the exhilarated Icarus soared through the air, giddy with his new power, and forgot his father's warning.  The feathers fell, and Icarus plunged to his death in the sea.|He met his doom like Icarus, flying too close to the sun. 他像伊卡洛斯一样，因飞得太靠近太阳而走向毁灭。|近义词:  high-flyer, dreamer|反义词: realist, pragmatist|词性:noun
