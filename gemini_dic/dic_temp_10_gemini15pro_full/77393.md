词源：  "Gaussage" is derived from "gauss," the unit of magnetic flux density named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, and the suffix "-age," which denotes a result of measurement or action.  "Gaussage" is not a commonly used word in scientific literature.  "Magnetic field strength" or "magnetic flux density" are generally preferred.
