cyclone-separator:/ˈsaɪkloʊn ˌsɛpəreɪtər/ | n. | 旋风分离器，旋流分离器 | A device that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a gas stream.  The gas stream enters a cylindrical or conical chamber tangentially, causing a swirling motion.  Heavier particles are forced outward against the wall and fall to the bottom, while the cleaned gas exits through a central outlet. | The cyclone separator effectively removed the dust from the airflow. 旋风分离器有效地去除了气流中的灰尘。

The factory uses a cyclone-separator to remove sawdust from the air before it is released outside.  这家工厂使用旋风分离器去除空气中的锯末，然后再将其排放到室外。 | synonyms: centrifugal separator, vortex separator | antonyms: N/A | noun
