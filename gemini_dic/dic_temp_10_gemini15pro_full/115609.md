marcasitic:/mɑːrˈkæsɪtɪk/ | adj. |  硫砷铁矿的；像硫砷铁矿的 | Resembling or containing marcasite, a mineral form of iron sulfide (FeS2). | The geologist identified the sample as a marcasitic nodule. 地质学家将样品鉴定为硫砷铁矿结核。 | The mine is rich in marcasitic ore.  这个矿山富含硫砷铁矿石。 | 近义词: pyritic (黄铁矿的) | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, could consider terms like "non-sulfidic" or specific mineral names if contrasting with other minerals) | 词性: adjective

词源: From marcasite + -ic. Marcasite comes from an alteration (influenced by Spanish and Portuguese) of Arabic markasītā, of uncertain origin.
