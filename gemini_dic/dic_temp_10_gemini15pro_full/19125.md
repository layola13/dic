The word "beun" is not a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, slang, a regional dialect word, or part of a specific jargon.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  

However, if you meant **"been,"** which is the past participle of the verb "to be," then here's the analysis:

been: /bɪn/ | v. (past participle) | 是 (过去分词) | Past participle of the verb "be," used in perfect tenses and as part of passive voice constructions. |  I have been to Paris. 我去过巴黎。 | Synonyms: existed (in perfect tenses) | Antonyms: N/A (past participles don't have antonyms) | verb
