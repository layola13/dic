ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (meaning "wrong" or "bad") + rely.  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly," "badly," "astray," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-", from Proto-Indo-European "*mei- (1)" (to change, go, move).  "Rely" comes from Middle English "relien," from Old French "relier" (to rally, assemble), from Latin "religare" (to tie back, fasten), from "re-" (back, again) + "ligare" (to bind).
