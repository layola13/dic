ctenocyst: /ˈtenəˌsɪst/ | n. |栉囊; 感觉器 |A sensory organ found in ctenophores (comb jellies), used for balance and orientation.  It consists of a statolith (a small, calcareous body) resting on four tufts of fused cilia.  |The ctenocyst allows the comb jelly to sense its orientation in the water. 栉囊让栉水母感知它在水中的方向。|Synonym: sensory organ, balancing organ |Antonym: N/A | Noun
