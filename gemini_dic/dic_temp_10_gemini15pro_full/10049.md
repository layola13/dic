ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *āplustrium*, from *ā+* plus *plūstrum* ("stern, poop deck").  The "ā-" prefix may be an intensive or may be derived from *ab* ("from"), meaning "from the stern".  Plūstrum is related to *pluere* ("to rain"), perhaps because the stern of a ship was raised high like a rain cloud.
