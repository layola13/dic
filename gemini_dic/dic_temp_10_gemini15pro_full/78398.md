ETYMOLOGY->
From the phrasal verb "get back up," meaning to rise again after falling or being knocked down. The noun form evolved from this, referring to something that helps one get back up or that serves as a replacement if the primary fails.  "Get" comes from Old Norse "geta" (to get, beget). "Back" comes from Old English "bæc" (back). "Up" comes from Old English "up" (up).
