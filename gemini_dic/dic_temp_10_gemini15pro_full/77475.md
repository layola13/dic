The word "gaytre" doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a slang term, or a newly coined word.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered the word, what you think it might mean), I can try to help further.


However, since the instructions request a demonstration of the format using a real word, I'll use "axiom" as an example:


axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理; 定理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example: It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应该与恐怖分子谈判，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。| Example:  The mathematical axiom states that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. 这个数学公理指出，两点之间最短的距离是直线。| Synonyms: principle, theorem, postulate,  | Antonyms: absurdity, paradox | noun
