词源：block (n.) from Old North French bloc "a block, lump," from a Germanic source (compare Middle Dutch block "beam, trunk," Old High German bloh "log, block"), from Proto-Germanic *klukkaz. The verb meaning "to obstruct" is from 1889, from the noun.  The figurative sense "to prevent oneself from thinking or feeling something unpleasant" is by 1947.
