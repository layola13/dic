From Old French *confiture (unattested), from confire (“to preserve, pickle”), from Latin conficere (“to accomplish, complete, finish, make up; to exhaust, weaken”), from con- (“together”) + facere (“to do, make”).  The original meaning was "a confection," later shifting to "discomfiture" in the 16th century.
