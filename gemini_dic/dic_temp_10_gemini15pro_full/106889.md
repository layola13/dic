labyrinthodonta:/ˌlæbəˈrɪnθəˌdɒntə/ | n. | 迷齿螈类 | An extinct subclass of early amphibians characterized by complexly folded tooth enamel, hence the name "labyrinth tooth." They lived primarily during the Paleozoic Era. |  Example: Labyrinthodonta were among the first vertebrates to truly colonize land. 迷齿螈类是最早真正殖民陆地的脊椎动物之一。

Example:  Fossil evidence suggests some labyrinthodonta grew to enormous sizes. 化石证据表明，一些迷齿螈可以长到巨大的尺寸。 | 近义词:  temnospondyls (more specific group within Labyrinthodonta) | 反义词: N/A (extinct group) | 词性: Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *labyrinthos* (λαβύρινθος, "maze, labyrinth") + *odous* (ὀδούς, "tooth").  Referring to the complex infolding of the enamel in their teeth.
