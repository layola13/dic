PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases.  It's a highly technical term and doesn't lend itself to common phrases.)


注意事项:

This word is very uncommon and would primarily be used in philosophical or highly specialized contexts.  It is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to "actual," then adding the suffix "-ness" to create an abstract noun.  Its plural form is also rarely used.
