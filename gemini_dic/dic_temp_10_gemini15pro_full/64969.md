词源: From "estimable" + "-ly."  "Estimable" comes from the Late Latin "aestimabilis," meaning "worthy of esteem," from "aestimare" (to estimate, value), from "aes" (bronze, money) + "-timare" (to reckon, assess).  The shift in meaning from "worthy of esteem" to "capable of being estimated" occurred in English.
