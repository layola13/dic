logarithmic: /ˌlɒɡəˈrɪðmɪk/ (US) /ˌlɒɡəˈrɪðmɪk/ (UK)| adj.| 对数的 |Relating to or expressed in terms of logarithms.  A logarithmic scale uses the logarithm of a quantity instead of the quantity itself.  This allows a large range of values to be displayed on a compact scale.|The Richter scale is logarithmic, meaning a magnitude 7 earthquake is ten times more powerful than a magnitude 6 earthquake.|近义词: exponential (in an inverse sense)|反义词: linear|词性:形容词

logarithm: /ˈlɒɡərɪðəm/ (US) /ˈlɒɡərɪðəm/ (UK) | n. | 对数 | A quantity representing the power to which a fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce a given number.| The logarithm of 100 to the base 10 is 2. | 近义词: exponent (in an inverse sense) | 反义词: antilogarithm | 词性:名词
