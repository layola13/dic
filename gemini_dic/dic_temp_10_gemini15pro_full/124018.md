moronity's:/məˈrɒnɪtiz/ | n. | 愚蠢，低能，弱智 |  "Moronity's" is not a standard English word. It's likely a non-standard possessive form of "moronity," which itself is a rare and somewhat archaic term for the state or quality of being a moron (a stupid person). It refers to extreme foolishness or stupidity. |  Due to its non-standard and rare nature, constructing natural-sounding examples is difficult. A contrived example could be: "The politician's decisions reflected the sheer moronity's of his thinking." (This example is grammatically correct but sounds unnatural.  A native speaker would be very unlikely to use this.) | 近义词：stupidity, foolishness, idiocy, imbecility | 反义词：intelligence, wisdom, brilliance | 词性：名词
