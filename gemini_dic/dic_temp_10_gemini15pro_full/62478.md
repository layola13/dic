endosmosmic:/ˌɛndoʊˈzmɒzɪk/ /ˌɛndoʊˈɑːzmɑːzɪk/
adjective
内渗的
Relating to or involving endosmosis, the inward passage of a fluid through a semipermeable membrane.
例句：
The endosmosmic process allows water to enter the cell. 内渗过程允许水进入细胞。

The plant's roots absorbed water through an endosmosmic action. 植物的根通过内渗作用吸收水分。


近义词：inward-flowing,  absorbing
反义词：exosmotic
词性：adjective


词源:
From  endo- (within) + osmos- (pushing, thrusting) + -ic (forming adjectives).  Ultimately from Greek  *endō- (inside, within) + ōsmos (a pushing, thrusting).
