famousnesses:/ˈfeɪməsnɪsɪz/ | n. | 名望，著名 (通常不用复数)| The state or quality of being famous; renown. This word is rarely used and considered non-standard.

词源:  Derived from "famous" + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns of state or quality).  "Famous" comes from Old French "fameus," from Latin "famosus" ("renowned, famous, notorious"), from "fama" ("fame, rumor, report").
