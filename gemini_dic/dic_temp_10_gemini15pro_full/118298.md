ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *mercuriālis* "of or pertaining to Mercury," from Latin *Mercurius* "Mercury" (the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, messages, travelers, trickery, and thieves, identified with the Greek god Hermes).  The association with quick and unpredictable changes comes from the liquid and mobile nature of the element mercury (also named after the god).
