hypothallus:/haɪˈpɒθələs/ | n. | 菌丝体下层，垫状菌丝体 |A layer of dense hyphae, often dark-colored, forming a supporting structure from which fruiting bodies arise in some fungi.| The hypothallus of the mushroom was a dark brown color. 蘑菇的垫状菌丝体是深棕色的。| synonyms: subiculum, mycelium | antonyms:  (No direct antonyms exist, as it is a specific structural component) | noun

Etymology:  From Greek *hypo* (under) + *thallus* (young shoot or twig, later used botanically for a plant body not differentiated into stem and leaves).
