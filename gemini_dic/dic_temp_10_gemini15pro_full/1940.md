ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *aktīn* (ray) + *zōion* (animal)

USAGE->
The term "Actinozoa" is an older, now largely obsolete taxonomic classification. While still occasionally encountered, it's generally been replaced by "Anthozoa." Therefore, providing usage examples for sentences constructed around the word itself is less relevant than explaining its taxonomic context.

It's more likely to be found in older scientific texts or discussions of historical classifications.  For example:

"Nineteenth-century naturalists classified corals and sea anemones under the class Actinozoa."  十九世纪的博物学家将珊瑚和海葵归类为珊瑚虫纲。

"The Actinozoa, as they were once known, are fascinating creatures."  曾经被称为珊瑚虫纲的生物是迷人的生物。



PHRASE->
(Due to the specialized, scientific nature of this word, common phrases are not applicable.  Focus should be on its relationship to the preferred term "Anthozoa.")

Actinozoa is sometimes used synonymously with Anthozoa.  珊瑚虫纲有时被用作珊瑚虫纲的同义词。
The classification of Actinozoa has been superseded by Anthozoa. 珊瑚虫纲的分类已被珊瑚虫纲取代。
