PHRASE->

N/A  (Granada is typically used as a standalone noun.)


词源：From Spanish *granada*, literally "pomegranate," from Latin *grānātum* "seeded," neuter of *grānātus*, past participle of *grānāre* "to seed," from *grānum* "grain, seed."  The weapon sense developed from the resemblance to the fruit.
