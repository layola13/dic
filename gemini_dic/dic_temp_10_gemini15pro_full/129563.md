non-Caucasians: /ˌnɒnˈkɔːkˈeɪʒənz/ | adj. n. | 非白种人 | People who are not of Caucasian origin, typically used to refer to people of color.  This term is considered outdated and potentially offensive because it defines groups of people by what they are *not* rather than by their own positive identities.  It's generally better to use more specific and respectful terms like "people of color," "Black people," "Asian people," "Indigenous people," etc. |  In the past, some forms referred to "non-Caucasians" as a distinct group. (This usage is outdated and problematic.) | Synonym: people of color (preferred), minorities (can be problematic) | Antonym: Caucasians (also outdated, use "white people" if necessary) | Noun/Adjective
