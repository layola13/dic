decursively: /dɪˈkɜːrsɪvli/ | adv. | 递归地，循环地 | Recursively means in a manner that repeats a process or definition by referring to itself. It's often used in computer science to describe algorithms that break down a problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. | The function calculates the factorial recursively.  这个函数递归地计算阶乘。 | recursively calls itself.  递归地调用自身。 |近义词：iteratively |反义词: N/A |词性: 副词

词源: From "recursive" + "-ly". "Recursive" comes from Latin "recurrere" (to run back), from "re-" (back) + "currere" (to run).
