clarification's:/ˌklærɪfɪˈkeɪʃənz/| n.| 说明，澄清，解释 |The clarification's he provided were helpful in understanding the complex issue. 他提供的说明有助于理解这个复杂的问题。| clarification's is the possessive form of clarification, referring to something that belongs to or is associated with a clarification.  It is less commonly used than the singular form "clarification."  It is often better to rephrase to avoid the possessive of a complex abstract noun. For example, "the clarifications of the policy" could be rewritten as "the policy clarifications" or "the ways in which the policy was clarified". |Example 1:  He requested further clarification's on the new regulations.  他要求进一步说明新的规章制度。

Example 2:  The committee issued a series of clarification's regarding the voting procedures. 委员会发布了一系列关于投票程序的说明。| synonyms: explanation, elucidation, exposition | antonyms: confusion, obfuscation, mystification | noun
