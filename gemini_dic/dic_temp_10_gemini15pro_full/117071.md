Etymology: A blend of "me too" (referring to the #MeToo movement) and "-istic" (a suffix forming adjectives).  "Me too" itself originated as a social media hashtag used to express solidarity with victims of sexual harassment and assault. The term "me-tooistic" emerged later to describe behaviors perceived as insincere or exploitative of the movement.
