ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lard, from Old English *hlāford (meaning "loaf-ward" or "bread keeper"), from hlāf ("loaf," "bread") + weard ("guardian," "keeper").  The term evolved semantically to refer to the master of the house and then to a landowner.  The modern spelling "laird" is influenced by Scots pronunciation.
