ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + commiseration.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "lack of." "Commiseration" comes from the Late Latin "commiseratio," from "commiserari" meaning "to pity," from "com-" (with) + "miserari" (to pity, lament).  Ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root "*mais-" (to feel bad, have pity).
