cacoxene:/kəˈkɒksiːn/ | n. | 水磷铁矿 | A hydrated basic iron phosphate mineral, typically yellow to brownish-yellow in color. It is often found in association with other iron phosphate minerals. | Cacoxene is a secondary mineral formed by the alteration of primary phosphate minerals. 水磷铁矿是一种由原生磷酸盐矿物蚀变形成的次生矿物。|  Cacoxene can be found in oxidized zones of iron ore deposits. 水磷铁矿可以在铁矿床的氧化带中找到。 | Synonyms: None specifically for the mineral, but other hydrated iron phosphates exist. | Antonyms: N/A | Noun
