词源：
"Fraughting" comes from the verb "freight," which originally meant "to load a ship with cargo." "Freight" itself comes from the Middle Dutch word "vrecht," meaning "freight, cargo, fare."  Over time, the meaning expanded to encompass transportation of goods by any means. "Fraughting" is the noun form of this verb, specifically referring to the act of transporting freight.
