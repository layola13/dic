注意事项:
"Opination" is not standard English. The correct word is "opinion."  This entire analysis is based on the corrected spelling, "opinion."  There is no etymology for "opination" because it's a misspelling.  The etymology of "opinion" is from the Latin "opīniō," meaning "thought, conjecture, fancy."
