ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *desultorius "leaping from one thing to another," from desultor "a circus rider who jumps from one horse to another," from desilire "to leap down," from de- "down" + salire "to leap."  The noun form "desultoriness" arises from the adjective "desultory."  The plural form, "desultorinesses," while less common, is grammatically correct and refers to multiple instances or states of being desultory.
