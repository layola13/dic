例句：This particular binary star is noneclipsing, making it harder to study. 这颗特殊的双星是不发生食的，因此更难研究。


近义词:non-eclipsing
反义词:eclipsing
词性:adjective

词源: "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "eclipsing" (present participle of "eclipse," from Latin "eclipsis," from Greek "ekleipsis," meaning "a leaving out, abandonment, failing," from "ekleipein" "to leave out," from "ek-" "out" + "leipein" "to leave").
