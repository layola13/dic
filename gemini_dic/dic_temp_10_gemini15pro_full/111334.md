词源:
"live" comes from Old English "libban," meaning "to live, be alive."  "With" comes from Old English "wið," meaning "against, opposite, toward, near." The combined meaning evolved to encompass both the physical proximity of sharing a residence and the psychological endurance of tolerating something.
