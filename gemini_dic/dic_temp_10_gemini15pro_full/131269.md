noncausality:/ˌnɒnˌkɔːˈzælɪti/| n.|非因果性，非因果关系|The principle of noncausality states that two events are not necessarily linked by cause and effect.|Example 1: Quantum entanglement exhibits noncausality, as changes in one entangled particle instantaneously affect the other regardless of distance. 量子纠缠表现出非因果性，因为一个纠缠粒子的变化会瞬间影响另一个粒子，而不管距离如何。

Example 2:  Some philosophical arguments propose noncausality as a fundamental aspect of reality. 一些哲学论证提出非因果性是现实的一个基本方面。|近义词: acausality, independence, non-dependence|反义词: causality, dependence|词性: noun
