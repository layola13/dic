PHRASE->
No phrase exists with "nonargumentatively" being a core component due to its specific and less common usage.  It typically stands alone as an adverb modifying a verb.


词源: non- (not) + argumentative + -ly (adverbial suffix).  Derived from "argumentative," which comes from "argument" ultimately from Latin *arguere* (to make clear, prove, accuse).
