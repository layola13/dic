ETYMOLOGY->
From geek + -iness.  "Geek" originally referred to a carnival performer, often involving outlandish or grotesque acts.  Over time, it evolved to mean a socially awkward or intellectually obsessive person, particularly in the realm of technology or specific niche interests. The suffix "-iness" transforms the noun "geek" into an abstract noun representing the quality or state of being a geek.
