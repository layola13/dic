注意事项:
"Majesticalness" is a somewhat archaic word and less commonly used than "majesty" or "grandeur."  While grammatically correct, it might sound overly formal or even affected in modern usage.  Consider using synonyms like "majesty," "grandeur," "magnificence," or "splendor" for more natural-sounding prose.
