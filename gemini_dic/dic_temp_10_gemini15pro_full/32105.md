Etymology: From chest + -ier (comparative adjective suffix).  "Chest" comes from Old English "cest" (box, coffin), which in turn comes from Latin "cista" (box).  The "-ier" suffix is used to form the comparative degree of adjectives, indicating a greater degree of the quality expressed by the base adjective.
