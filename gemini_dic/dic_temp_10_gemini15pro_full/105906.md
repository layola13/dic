词源:  "Kitty-corner" and its variants ("catty-corner," "cater-corner") are of uncertain origin. One theory suggests a corruption of the French phrase "quatre coins" (four corners), while another points to the possible influence of the word "cat" in reference to the diagonal movement of a cat.  The term likely emerged in American English in the 19th century.
