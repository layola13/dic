non-stationary:/ˌnɒnˈsteɪʃənəri/ /ˌnɑːnˈsteɪʃəneri/ | adj. | 非平稳的，非静止的 | Not remaining constant over time, especially statistically.  Relating to a process whose statistical properties change over time. | The stock market is a non-stationary time series, meaning its statistical properties like mean and variance change over time. 股票市场是一个非平稳的时间序列，这意味着它的统计特性，如均值和方差，会随着时间而变化。

The weather patterns this year have been non-stationary, fluctuating wildly from week to week. 今年的天气模式是非平稳的，每周都在剧烈波动。 | 近义词：unstable, fluctuating, volatile, dynamic | 反义词：stationary, stable, constant, static | 词性: adjective

Etymology:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "stationary" (from Latin "stationarius," meaning "standing still").
