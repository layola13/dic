actinometer: /ˌæktɪˈnɒmɪtər/ (US) /ˌæktɪˈnɑːmɪtər/
n.
光化线强度计；曝光表
An instrument for measuring the intensity of radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation, by measuring the fluorescence it induces in a chemical solution or the amount of chemical change it produces.
The actinometer measured the intensity of the sunlight.  光化线强度计测量了阳光的强度。
The photographer used an actinometer to determine the correct exposure. 摄影师使用曝光表来确定正确的曝光。

近义词: radiometer, light meter, exposure meter
反义词:  (No direct antonym, perhaps devices that *block* radiation)
词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *actinomètre*, from Ancient Greek *aktīn* (ἀκτίς, “ray”) + *-meter* (*-mètre*).
