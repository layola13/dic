The word "atwite" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a regional/dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.  If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer more assistance.

However, since the prompt asks for explanations of grammatical concepts using "what" I can provide that information.


what: /wʌt/ | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么, 多么 | used to ask for information about something | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Which, who | Nothing (as a response) | pronoun, determiner, adverb
