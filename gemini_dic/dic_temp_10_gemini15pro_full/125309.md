multigraph:/ˈmʌltɪɡræf/| n. |多重图|A graph in which multiple edges are allowed between any two vertices, and loops are also allowed.  It's a generalization of a graph where more than one edge can connect the same two vertices.  These multiple edges are called parallel edges.|The multigraph shows two routes between city A and city B.|近义词:pseudograph|反义词:simple graph|词性:noun
ETYMOLOGY->
From multi- (many) + graph (writing, drawing). Ultimately from Greek *gráphein* (to write, draw).
