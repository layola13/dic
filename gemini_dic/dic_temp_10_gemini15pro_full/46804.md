词源：
From Middle English *dank, from Old Norse dökkr (“dark”), from Proto-Germanic *dunkwaz (“dark”).  Relates to "dunk" as in to dunk something in water.  Originally referring to darkness and gloom, the word evolved to describe the cold, damp feeling associated with dark places. The slang meaning of “excellent” emerged in the 1980s, possibly from its association with high-quality marijuana, which is often kept in damp, dark conditions to preserve its potency.
