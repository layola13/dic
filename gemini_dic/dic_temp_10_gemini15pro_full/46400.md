daff:/dæf/
|n.|傻瓜，笨蛋|A silly or foolish person.|He's such a daff sometimes, he forgets his own head if it wasn't attached.|近义词：idiot, fool, nitwit, dolt|反义词:genius, intellectual|词性:名词
词源:Probably a shortened form of "daffadowndilly," a playful variant of "affodil," from Middle English "affodile," from Medieval Latin "affodillus," ultimately from Greek "asphodelos."  The meaning shifted from the flower to a foolish person, perhaps due to the perceived silliness of the flower's nodding head.
