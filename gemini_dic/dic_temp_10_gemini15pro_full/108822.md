From Old English *lēafed, past participle of *lēafian "to furnish with leaves," from Proto-Germanic *laubōjaną, from *laubiz "leaf." Cognate with Dutch loven "to praise," German loben "to praise."  The connection between "leaf" and "praise" likely comes from the practice of using leaves for decoration or awards.
