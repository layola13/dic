词源:  "Gazillion" is a humorous, informal word used to represent an indefinitely large number.  It's a blend of "gaz-" (perhaps from "gaze," suggesting something vast) and the suffix "-illion" (as in million, billion, trillion).  Adding "-aire" (as in millionaire, billionaire) creates "gazillionaire," denoting someone with an immense, almost unimaginable fortune.
