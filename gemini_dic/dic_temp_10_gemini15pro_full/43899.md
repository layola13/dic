词源: From French crétiniser, from crétin (“cretin”).  Ultimately from Vulgar Latin *christianus (“Christian”), used ironically to refer to someone with intellectual disabilities, who was perceived as innocent and blessed by God. This meaning then shifted to describe physical deformities associated with iodine deficiency, and finally to describe the chalky appearance of substances.
