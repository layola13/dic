词源: "Jive" originates from African American Vernacular English, likely related to earlier slang terms for glib or deceptive talk.  "Jive" then expanded to refer to swing music and dancing, eventually encompassing a broader sense of lively or energetic activity.  "Jiviest" is the superlative form of "jivy," formed by adding the suffix "-est."
