concurrency: /kənˈkɜːrənsi/ /kɑːnˈkɜːrənsi/ | n. | 并发，同时发生，共存 | The simultaneous occurrence of events or conditions.  The state of operating or occurring at the same time.  The fact of two or more events or circumstances happening or existing at the same time. |  The concurrency of the two events was remarkable. 这两个事件同时发生真是非同寻常。 | synonyms: simultaneity, coincidence, contemporaneity, synchronicity | antonyms:  asynchrony, non-simultaneity | noun

concurrency: /kənˈkɜːrənsi/ /kɑːnˈkɜːrənsi/ | n. | 并发（计算机），并发性 | In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. |  Concurrency control is crucial in database management systems.  并发控制在数据库管理系统中至关重要。 | synonyms: parallelism, multithreading, multiprocessing | antonyms: sequential processing, serial processing | noun
