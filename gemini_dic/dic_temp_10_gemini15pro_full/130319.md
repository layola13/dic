non-term:/ˌnɒnˈtɜːrm/ | adj. | 非终结符；非终结的 |  In computer science, particularly in the context of formal grammars and parsing, a non-terminal symbol is a symbol that can be replaced by other symbols (either terminal or non-terminal) according to the rules of the grammar.  It represents a syntactic category or concept, rather than a concrete element of the language. |  Example: In the grammar rule "S -> NP VP" (Sentence -> Noun Phrase Verb Phrase), S, NP, and VP are non-terminals. | Synonyms: nonterminal, syntactic variable | Antonyms: terminal symbol | part of speech: adjective
