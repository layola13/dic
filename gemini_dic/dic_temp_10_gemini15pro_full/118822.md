metanephridium:/ˌmɛtəˈnɛfrɪdiəm/ | n. | 后肾管 |A type of excretory tubule found in many invertebrates, such as annelids and mollusks. It typically consists of a ciliated funnel opening into the body cavity and a duct that leads to an external opening called a nephridiopore.  | Earthworms have metanephridia to excrete waste. 蚯蚓有后肾管来排泄废物。 | nephridium, excretory organ |  None | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From meta- (Greek: "after," "changed") + nephridium (from Greek nephros, "kidney").
