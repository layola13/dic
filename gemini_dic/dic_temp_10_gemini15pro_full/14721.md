awarest:/əˈwɛərst/ | adj. |  最知道的，意识最强的 (non-standard, rare) | Most aware; having the greatest awareness.  It implies a superlative degree of awareness, though grammatically incorrect. | He seemed awarest of the danger. 他似乎是对危险最警觉的人。| 近义词: most aware, most conscious, most mindful | 反义词: least aware, oblivious, unaware | 词性: 形容词

Etymology:  Formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "aware," although "aware" doesn't traditionally take such a suffix.  "Aware" itself comes from Old English *ġewær, related to "wary."
