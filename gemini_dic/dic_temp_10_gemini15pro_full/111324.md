ETYMOLOGY->
This idiom alludes to eating the best cuts of pork, which are higher up on the hog.  The phrase originated in the American South in the 19th century.  The "high" parts of the hog, like the loin and tenderloin, were considered the choicest and most expensive cuts, while the "low" parts, like the feet and pig's knuckles, were cheaper and eaten by those with less money.
