词源：From Middle French *fausset (attested in the derivative *faussetière "tapster"), diminutive of *fals "barrel spigot," from Old French fals, borrowed from Late Latin falsus "false," from Latin fallere "to deceive, cheat, lead into error, trick, dupe."  The sense development is from "spigot with a false bottom" (for drawing off wine without disturbing the lees) to "spigot, tap."
