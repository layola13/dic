/ˌbaɪoʊˈrɪðmɪsɪsts/ | n. | 生物节律学家 | A person who studies or believes in biorhythms (cyclical patterns in human behavior and physiology). | Biorhythmicists believe that our physical, emotional, and intellectual states are influenced by predictable cycles. 生物节律学家认为，我们的身体、情绪和智力状态都受到可预测的周期性变化的影响。 |  Example 1: Some biorhythmicists advise scheduling important events according to your biorhythm cycles.  一些生物节律学家建议根据你的生物节律周期来安排重要事件。

Example 2: The biorhythmicists claimed they could predict performance based on these cycles. 生物节律学家声称他们可以根据这些周期预测表现。 |  Synonyms:  biorhythm researchers, cycle theorists | Antonyms: (No direct antonyms, perhaps skeptics, or scientists who refute biorhythms) | Noun


Etymology:

bio- (life) + rhythm + -ist (one who practices or studies)

From Greek bios "life" + rhythmos "measured motion, time, rhythm."
