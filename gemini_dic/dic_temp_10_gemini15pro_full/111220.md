lithosphere:/ˈlɪθəˌsfɪr/ | n. | 岩石圈 | The rigid outer part of the earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle. | The Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates. 地球的岩石圈被分成几个构造板块。| The earthquake originated in the lithosphere. 地震起源于岩石圈。 | synonyms: crust, Earth's crust | antonyms: asthenosphere | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek λίθος (líthos, “stone”) + σφαῖρα (sphaîra, “sphere, globe”).
