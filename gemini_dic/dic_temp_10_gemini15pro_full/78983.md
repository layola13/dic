Since "girrock" isn't a recognized English word, I can't provide accurate examples or phrases.  It's crucial to verify the spelling or consult regional dialect dictionaries if you believe it's a genuine word.  If it's a neologism (newly created word), its meaning would be defined by whoever coined it.
