ammonitoid:/ˈæmənaɪtɔɪd/ | n. | 菊石类 | An extinct group of cephalopods, related to the modern nautilus and squid, that lived in the seas from the Devonian to the Cretaceous periods, characterized by a coiled, chambered shell. |  Example 1: Ammonitoids are commonly found as fossils in marine rocks. 菊石类通常以化石的形式在海相岩石中被发现。

Example 2:  The museum has a fascinating exhibit of ammonitoid fossils.  博物馆有一个引人入胜的菊石化石展览。 | 近义词: ammonite, cephalopod | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Modern Latin *Ammonites (plural), from Latin Ammonis cornu "horn of Ammon," referring to the resemblance of the fossil shells to the ram's horns of the Egyptian god Ammon.  +-oid "resembling," from Greek -eidos.
