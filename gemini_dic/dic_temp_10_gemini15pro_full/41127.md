ETYMOLOGY->
"Co-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "jointly."  It comes from the Latin "com-" (meaning "with," "together").
"Prosper" comes from the Latin "prosperare," meaning "to succeed," "to thrive," or "to be fortunate."  It's related to "pro-" (meaning "forward") and "spes" (meaning "hope").
Therefore, "coprosper" literally means "to thrive together." The plural form "coprosperities" refers to multiple instances or states of shared prosperity.
