epispore:/ˈɛpɪˌspɔːr/| n.|外生孢子|An outer coat or covering of a spore, especially in certain fungi and algae. It is formed from the perisporium.  It is an outer, non-spore wall layer.|The epispore of this fungus is distinctly ornamented.  这种真菌的外生孢子有明显的纹饰。|近义词:perispore, exospore|反义词:endospore|词性:noun

词源: From epi- + spore.  "Epi-" is a prefix meaning "upon" or "over." "Spore" refers to a reproductive cell.
