ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *bounen*, *bownen*, from Old Norse *búinn* (ready, prepared, finished, past participle of *búa* (to prepare, make ready, dwell)), from Proto-Germanic *būaną* (to dwell, inhabit, cultivate), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰew- (to be, exist, grow).  The sense of "bounce" developed later, perhaps influenced by the image of something springing up or becoming active.
