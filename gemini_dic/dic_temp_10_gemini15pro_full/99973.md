interoscillating:/ˌɪntərˈɒsɪleɪtɪŋ/ | adj. |相互振荡的，交替振荡的 | Moving back and forth between two points or states in a rhythmic or alternating fashion.  | The interoscillating pendulum demonstrated the complex interplay of forces. 交替振荡的钟摆展示了力的复杂相互作用。 | The two signals were interoscillating, creating a unique wave pattern. 两个信号相互振荡，形成了独特的波形。 | 近义词: alternating, fluctuating, oscillating | 反义词: static, constant | 词性: adjective

Etymology:
From inter- (prefix meaning "between, among, mutually, reciprocally") + oscillate (verb meaning "to swing back and forth with a steady rhythm"). Oscillate itself comes from Latin oscillāre, meaning "to swing."
