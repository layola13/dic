ETYMOLOGY->
From active + -ness + -es.  "Active" traces back to the Latin "activus," meaning "busy, practical, effective," derived from "actus," the past participle of "agere," meaning "to do, drive, act."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state or quality. The suffix "-es" creates the plural form.

USAGE->

Therefore, providing usage examples for different tenses and grammatical structures feels forced and unnatural.  It's better to illustrate how the singular form "activeness" or alternative phrasing would be used in typical contexts.
