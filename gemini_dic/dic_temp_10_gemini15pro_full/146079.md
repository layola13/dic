Etymology:  The word "overeditorialize" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") with the verb "editorialize" (meaning "to express opinions rather than just report facts").  "Editorialize" comes from "editorial," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "editor," meaning "publisher."
