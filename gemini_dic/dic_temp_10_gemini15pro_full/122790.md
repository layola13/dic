moldability's:/ˌmoʊldəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可塑性，成型性 | The quality of something that can be easily molded or shaped.  It refers to the ease with which a material can be deformed permanently under pressure without rupturing or cracking. | This clay has excellent moldability's, making it perfect for sculpting.  这种粘土具有极佳的可塑性，非常适合雕塑。 | Synonyms: plasticity, malleability, ductility | Antonyms: rigidity, stiffness | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From moldable + -ity + -'s.  "Moldable" comes from the verb "mold" (meaning "to shape"), which has roots in Old English "mold" (meaning "earth, soil").  The suffix "-ity" transforms the adjective "moldable" into the noun "moldability," indicating the state or quality of being moldable. The final -'s is the possessive marker.
