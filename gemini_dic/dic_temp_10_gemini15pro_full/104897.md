词源:
From Old English *cēpan (attested only in the past tense cēpte), from Proto-Germanic *kōpjaną (“to buy, bargain, barter”), from Proto-Indo-European *keh₂p- (“to seize, take hold of, receive”).  The meaning shifted from "to seize, hold" to "to continue to hold, retain."  The noun meaning "main tower of a castle" developed from the sense of a fortified stronghold that was kept or guarded.
