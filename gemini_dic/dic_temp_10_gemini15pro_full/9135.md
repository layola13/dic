词源:  "anti-" (against) + "mystic" (related to mysticism).  "Mystic" comes from the Greek "mystikos," meaning "initiated," referring to secret religious rites.  Therefore, "antimystic" literally means "against those involved in secret rites" and has evolved to mean opposed to mystical beliefs and practices in general.
