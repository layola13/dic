ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *blǣwen, from Proto-Germanic *blǣwaną (“to blow”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰlē- (“to blow, swell, bloom”). Cognate with Old High German blāwen (“to blow”), Latin flāre (“to blow”).  The meaning shifted from "to blow" to "to be blue" (like the sky or sea) and then was extended to other meanings related to the color blue.  The past tense and past participle form "blued" follows regular English verb conjugation patterns.
