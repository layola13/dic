ETYMOLOGY->
From hard-boiled + -ness. "Hard-boiled" originally referred to eggs cooked until both the white and yolk are solid, implying toughness.  This meaning was extended figuratively to people, particularly in the early 20th century, to describe a tough, unsentimental, and cynical attitude, often associated with detective fiction.  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "hard-boiled" into a noun representing the quality or state of being hard-boiled.
