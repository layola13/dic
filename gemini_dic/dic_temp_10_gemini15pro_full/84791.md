ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *handsom, *hondsom (“easy to handle, convenient, suitable, apt, ready, prompt, dexterous, skillful, clever, proper, fitting, decent, respectable”), from hand + -some (suffix forming adjectives meaning “characterized by or given to a specified action or quality”).  The semantic development from “dexterous” to “having a pleasing appearance” is similar to that of the word pretty.
