eccaleobion:/ˌɛkəliˈoʊbiɒn/ | n. |巢外生物；体外生物| An organism that develops outside of its parent's body, specifically outside of a nest or similar structure, as opposed to developing within a nest or inside the parent.  It refers to organisms that complete their development outside of the parent organism and not within a protective structure like a nest.|  Example:  Certain species of frogs exhibit eccaleobionic development, with their tadpoles growing in ponds rather than within dedicated nests. | 近义词: exotrophic, | 反义词: endotrophic, nidicolous | noun
