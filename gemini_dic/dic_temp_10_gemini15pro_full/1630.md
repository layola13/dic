acierage:/asjɛʁaʒ/ (French pronunciation)
noun
表面钢化, 渗碳, 钢化处理
The process of steeling or steel facing a metal object.  The application of a layer of steel to a surface, typically for increased hardness or wear resistance.
L'acierage des engrenages améliore leur durée de vie. = The steeling of the gears improves their lifespan.
Les cylindres du moteur ont subi un acierage pour une meilleure résistance. = The engine cylinders underwent steeling for improved resistance.
近义词: steel facing, case hardening, surface hardening
反义词: softening, annealing
词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From French acier (steel) + -age (suffix forming nouns of action or process). Ultimately from Latin aciarium (steel workshop).

USAGE->
This word is more commonly used in French than in English.  In English contexts, "steel facing" or "case hardening" are often preferred.  However, here are some example usages:

一般现在时:
Acierage improves the durability of metal parts. = 表面钢化提高了金属部件的耐用性。
This process involves acierage of the gears. =  这个过程包括齿轮的表面钢化。

一般过去时:
The crankshaft was acieraged to increase its strength. = 曲轴经过表面钢化处理以提高其强度。
The manufacturer acieraged the components for enhanced performance. = 制造商对组件进行了表面钢化处理以提高性能。

现在完成时:
The company has acieraged many parts for various industries. = 该公司已经为各行各业钢化处理了许多零件。
They have acieraged the surface to resist wear and tear. = 他们对表面进行了钢化处理以抵抗磨损。

过去完成时:
After the parts had been acieraged, they were assembled. = 零件经过表面钢化处理后，进行了组装。
Once the surface had been acieraged, it became much more resistant. = 表面一旦经过表面钢化处理，就变得更加耐磨了。


将来时:
The engineers will acierage the metal components next week. = 工程师们下周将对金属部件进行表面钢化处理。
We will acierage the gears to improve their lifespan. = 我们将对齿轮进行表面钢化处理以延长其使用寿命。

被动语态:
The surface is acieraged to increase hardness. = 表面经过钢化处理以增加硬度。
The gears were acieraged for better wear resistance. = 齿轮经过钢化处理以获得更好的耐磨性。

PHRASE->
process of acierage = 表面钢化过程
acierage treatment = 表面钢化处理
acierage of gears = 齿轮的表面钢化
acierage of components = 零件的表面钢化
benefits of acierage = 表面钢化的益处
