noninert:/ˌnɒnɪˈnɜːrt/
adjective
非惰性的
Not inert; chemically reactive.
Oxygen is a noninert gas and actively participates in chemical reactions. 氧气是一种非惰性气体，积极参与化学反应。
The noninert metal corroded quickly in the humid environment. 非惰性金属在潮湿的环境中迅速腐蚀。
近义词:reactive, active
反义词:inert, passive
词性:adjective

词源:
Prefix "non-" (not) + "inert" (from Latin "iners," meaning unskilled, inactive).  "Non-" 表示“不”，“inert”来自拉丁语“iners”，意思是“不熟练的”、“不活动的”。
