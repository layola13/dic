ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lecheren*, from Old French *lechier* (“to lick”), from Frankish *lekkōn* (“to lick”), from Proto-Germanic *likōną* (“to lick”), from Proto-Indo-European *leyǵʰ- (“to lick”). Cognate with Old English *liccian* (“to lick”), German *lecken* (“to lick”), Dutch *likken* (“to lick”), Swedish *slicka* (“to lick”).  The sense development from "licking" to "lustful" is likely due to association with animal behavior.
