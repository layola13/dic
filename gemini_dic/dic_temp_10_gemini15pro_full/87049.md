注意事项:  "heps" is highly informal and generally considered non-standard English. It is best avoided in formal writing or speech.  While listed as a verb contraction, it functions grammatically like the standard form "helps."  Its usage is primarily limited to casual conversations and dialects.  There are no significant differences in the conjugation between "heps" and "helps" due to the simple nature of the contraction.
