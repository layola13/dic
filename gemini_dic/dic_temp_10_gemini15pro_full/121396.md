词源：From Yiddish *מיש־מאַש (*mish-mash), from Hebrew *מִישְׁמָשׁ (*mišmāš) (apricot; confused mixture) or Aramaic *מְשַׁמְשָׁא (*məšamšā) (apricot). Ultimately related to Arabic مِشْمِش‎ (mišmiš, “apricot”). The semantic development from "apricot" to "mishmash" likely occurred through the preparation of apricot jam or other mixed fruit preserves.
