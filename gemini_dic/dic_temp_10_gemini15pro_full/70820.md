ETYMOLOGY->
From finical (meaning excessively particular or fastidious) + -ity (suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  "Finical" itself comes from the now obsolete "fine" (meaning refined, elegant, subtle) + -ical (suffix forming adjectives). Ultimately from Latin *finis* (end, limit, boundary).  The sense evolved from an emphasis on refinement and elegance to an excessive concern with minor details.
