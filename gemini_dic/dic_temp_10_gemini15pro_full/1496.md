acetary: /ˈæsɪtəri/ | n. | 缩醛; 缩酮 | A compound, especially a cyclic one, formed by the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with two alcohol molecules, or two hydroxyl groups of a single molecule.  It's a functional group with the connectivity R₂C(OR')₂.  | The reaction produced a cyclic acetal.  该反应生成了一个环状缩醛。

Acetals are commonly used as protecting groups in organic synthesis. 缩醛通常在有机合成中用作保护基。 | 近义词: ketal (specifically for ketones) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From French *acétal*, from Latin *acetum* (“vinegar”) + *-al* (suffix forming nouns denoting chemical derivatives).  Vinegar contains acetic acid, which is related to the formation of acetals.

USAGE->
一般现在时:
An acetal is formed from an aldehyde or ketone. = 缩醛是由醛或酮形成的。
The acetal protects the carbonyl group. = 缩醛保护羰基。

一般过去时:
The chemist synthesized the acetal yesterday. = 化学家昨天合成了缩醛。
The acetal was hydrolyzed back to the aldehyde. = 缩醛被水解回醛。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied acetals extensively. = 研究人员对缩醛进行了广泛的研究。
The reaction has produced the desired acetal. = 反应产生了所需的缩醛。

过去完成时:
The reaction had completed before the acetal was isolated. = 在分离缩醛之前，反应已经完成。
They had characterized the acetal by NMR spectroscopy. = 他们已经通过核磁共振波谱对缩醛进行了表征。

将来时:
We will synthesize a new acetal tomorrow. = 我们明天将合成一种新的缩醛。
The acetal will be used as a protecting group. = 缩醛将用作保护基。


被动语态:
The acetal was characterized by NMR. =  缩醛通过核磁共振进行了表征。
Acetals are often used in organic synthesis. = 缩醛常用于有机合成。

疑问句:
Is this compound an acetal? =  这种化合物是缩醛吗？
How is the acetal formed? = 缩醛是如何形成的？

否定句:
This compound is not an acetal. =  这种化合物不是缩醛。
The reaction did not produce the desired acetal. = 反应没有产生所需的缩醛。

PHRASE->
cyclic acetal = 环状缩醛
acetal formation = 缩醛形成
acetal hydrolysis = 缩醛水解
acetal protecting group = 缩醛保护基
dimethyl acetal = 二甲基缩醛
