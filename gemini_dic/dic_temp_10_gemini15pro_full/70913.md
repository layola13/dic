From "fire" + "arm," referring to weapons using gunpowder.  "Fire" comes from Old English "fȳr," ultimately from Proto-Germanic "*fōr-." "Arm" comes from Old English "earm," meaning "arm" (body part or weapon), from Proto-Germanic "*armz."  The combined term "firearm" became common in the late 16th century.
