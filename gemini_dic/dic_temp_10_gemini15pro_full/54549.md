dislive:/dɪsˈlɪv/| v. |不信; 怀疑; 不认可|To refuse to believe or accept something; to disbelieve.|He dislived the reports of a miracle. 他不相信关于奇迹的报道。|近义词：disbelieve, doubt, question, reject|反义词:believe, accept, trust|词性:动词

词源:  "dis-" (expressing negation) + "live" (Old English libban, from Proto-Germanic *liban, meaning "to live").  The original meaning was closer to "to deprive of life," but it evolved to mean "to disbelieve," likely because belief was seen as a vital force.
