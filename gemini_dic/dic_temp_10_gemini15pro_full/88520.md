注意事项:

* "hit's" itself isn't a standard word. It likely arises from typographical errors or misspellings of "it's."  All the examples and explanations above pertain to the correct form, "it's."
* The past tense of "it is" is "it was," and the past tense of "it has" depends on the context.  For example, "it has rained" becomes "it had rained" in the past perfect.
* Be careful not to confuse "it's" (it is/it has) with "its" (possessive form of it).
