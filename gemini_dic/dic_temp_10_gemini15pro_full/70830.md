PHRASE->

(This word doesn't readily form common phrases.  It's typically used on its own as an adjective.)  由于 "finiking" 主要作形容词使用，因此它没有常用的固定搭配。  以下是一些包含 "finicky" (finiking 的变体，更常用) 的词组：

be finicky about something = 对某事很挑剔
a finicky eater = 挑食的人


词源:  "Finicky" (and the less common "finiking") likely originates from "finickin'," a 19th-century alteration of "fenicking," which meant "trifling" or "fussy."  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but may be related to older Dutch words.  "Finicky" (以及不太常见的 "finiking") 可能源于19世纪对 "fenicking" 一词的改写，意思是“琐碎的”或“挑剔的”。  最终的起源尚不确定，但可能与古老的荷兰语单词有关。
