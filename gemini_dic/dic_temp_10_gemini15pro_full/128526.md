词源:
"Nexible" is a relatively new word and likely a portmanteau of "next" and "flexible".  While it's not yet recognized in standard dictionaries, its meaning is easily understood due to its component parts.  "Next" implies forward-thinking or modern, and "flexible" refers to adaptability.  Therefore, "nexible" suggests a modern form of flexibility.
