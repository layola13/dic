词源:  "Indevote" is likely a back-formation from "indevoted," which itself is derived from "in-" (meaning "in, into, on, upon, not") + "devoted" (from the Latin "dēvōtus," past participle of "dēvovēre" meaning "to vow, dedicate").  While "indevoted" is more commonly found as meaning "not devoted," "indevote" has taken on a meaning closer to "deeply devoted."
