ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *gōdspel (unattested), from gōd "good" + spel "story, message," ultimately from Proto-Germanic *spellaną "to tell."  Cognate with Old Saxon godspell, Old Frisian godspell, Old High German gotspel, and Gothic guþspell.  Replaced Old English godspell, influenced by Old Norse guðspjall.  The sense of "something regarded as true" developed in the 19th century.
