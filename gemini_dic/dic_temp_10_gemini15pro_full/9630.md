词源：
"Anti-" (prefix of Greek origin meaning "against, opposite of") + "stimulation" (from Latin "stimulare," meaning "to prick, incite").


注意事项：
Antistimulation is not a widely used term in common parlance.  It is more likely to be encountered in specialized contexts like medicine, neuroscience, or psychology.  Therefore, simpler synonyms like "reduction of stimulation" or "suppression of activity" might be preferred in general communication.
