ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + ponderous.  "Ponderous" comes from late 14c., "weighty, of great weight," from Old French ponderos (13c.) "heavy, weighty, important," from Latin ponderosus "weighty, heavy," from pondus (genitive ponderis) "weight," from pendere "to weigh, cause to hang down," related to pendulus "hanging."  The prefix "over-" intensifies the meaning to "excessively heavy."
