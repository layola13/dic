ETYMOLOGY->
From imp + -ishness.  Imp (n.) meaning "a small, mischievous devil or sprite" comes from Middle English impe, from Old English impa "young shoot, graft," later "young offspring," of uncertain origin. The sense shifted to "mischievous child" by the late 16th century, influenced by the word's use in translations of the Bible to refer to demons.
