chromosome:/ˈkrəʊməsəʊm/ (UK) /ˈkroʊməˌsoʊm/ (US)| n. |染色体|A thread-like structure located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique.|Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. 唐氏综合症是由21号染色体多出一条拷贝引起的。|synonyms: gene carrier, DNA molecule (loosely)|antonyms: N/A|noun
