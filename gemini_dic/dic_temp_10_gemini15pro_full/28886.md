ETYMOLOGY->
The word "carpool" is a compound word formed from "car" and "pool".  "Car" refers to an automobile, and "pool" in this context means a collective resource or a group sharing something.  The term originated in the United States, likely in the 1940s, during World War II, when gasoline rationing and rubber shortages encouraged people to share rides.
