ciliograde:/ˈsɪlioʊˌɡreɪd/
adjective
纤毛运动的
Moving by means of cilia.
Ciliograde organisms use tiny hair-like structures called cilia to propel themselves through water.  纤毛生物利用称为纤毛的微小毛发状结构在水中推动自己前进。
Paramecium is a well-known example of a ciliograde protozoan. 草履虫是纤毛虫原生动物的一个著名例子。
近义词:ciliary
反义词:(None readily available - consider antonyms of movement like sessile or immobile)
词性:adjective
