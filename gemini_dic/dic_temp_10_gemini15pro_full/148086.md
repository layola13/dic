ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + sceptical + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Sceptical" comes from the Greek "skeptikos" meaning "inquiring" or "thoughtful," later evolving to mean "doubtful."  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
