词源:  "Fellness" is a less common synonym for "illness."  "Fell" in this context comes from Old English *fell, meaning "cruel," "fierce," or "destructive," related to the Old Norse *felldr, meaning "struck down."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "fell" into the noun "fellness."  While "illness" is the more common term, "fellness" retains a more archaic and poetic feel, emphasizing the severity or harshness of the sickness.
