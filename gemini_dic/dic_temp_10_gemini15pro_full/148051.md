近义词: excessively, overwhelmingly, profusely

词性: 副词

词源:  From "overrun" + "-ing" + "-ly". "Overrun" comes from "over-" (meaning "excessive") and "run" (meaning to flow or spread).  The "-ing" suffix creates a present participle, often used to form adjectives, and the "-ly" suffix transforms it into an adverb.
