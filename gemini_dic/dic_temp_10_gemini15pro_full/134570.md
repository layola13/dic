nonlocal:/ˌnɒnˈləʊkəl/ (British), /ˌnɑːnˈloʊkəl/ (American)| keyword | 非局部的 |  A keyword in Python used to declare that a variable inside a nested function refers to a variable in its enclosing function's scope, rather than creating a new local variable.  It allows modification of variables in outer scopes from within inner functions, without using `global`. |

例句：

```python
def outer_function():
    x = 10

    def inner_function():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20

    inner_function()
    print(x)  # Output: 20
```

中文：

```
def 外部函数():
    x = 10

    def 内部函数():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20

    内部函数()
    print(x)  # 输出: 20
```


```python
def make_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter

counter = make_counter()
print(counter()) # Output: 1
print(counter()) # Output: 2
```

中文：
```python
def 创建计数器():
    计数 = 0
    def 计数器():
        nonlocal 计数
        计数 += 1
        return 计数
    return 计数器

计数器 = 创建计数器()
print(计数器()) # 输出: 1
print(计数器()) # 输出: 2
```
