laccolith: /ˈlækəˌlɪθ/ | n. | 岩盖 | A mass of igneous rock, typically lens-shaped, that has been intruded between rock strata causing uplift in the shape of a dome. | Example 1: The geologists discovered a large laccolith during their survey of the mountain range.  地质学家在对山脉进行勘测时发现了一个巨大的岩盖。

Example 2: The formation of the laccolith millions of years ago significantly altered the landscape. 数百万年前岩盖的形成极大地改变了地貌。 | 近义词: dome, sill, intrusion | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific geological formation) | 词性: noun


USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):
Example 1: A laccolith forms when magma intrudes between layers of rock. 岩盖是岩浆侵入岩层之间时形成的。
Example 2:  The laccolith displaces the overlying strata, creating a dome-like structure. 岩盖置换上覆地层，形成穹顶状结构。

现在进行时 (Present Continuous):
Example 1:  The pressure from the rising magma is currently forming a laccolith. 上升的岩浆压力目前正在形成一个岩盖。
Example 2: Geologists are studying the laccolith to understand its formation. 地质学家正在研究岩盖以了解其形成过程。

现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
Example 1:  The erosion has exposed the laccolith over time.  侵蚀作用随着时间的推移暴露出了岩盖。
Example 2: Scientists have documented several laccoliths in this region. 科学家在这个地区记录了几个岩盖。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Example 1:  Geologists have been researching the formation of this laccolith for years. 多年来，地质学家一直在研究这个岩盖的形成过程。
Example 2: The magma has been slowly pushing upwards, creating a laccolith over millennia.  几千年来，岩浆一直在缓慢地向上推动，形成了一个岩盖。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
Example 1: The laccolith formed millions of years ago. 岩盖形成于数百万年前。
Example 2:  The intrusion of magma created a laccolith beneath the surface. 岩浆的侵入在地表下形成了一个岩盖。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
Example 1:  While the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, this laccolith was slowly forming underground. 当恐龙在地球上漫游时，这个岩盖正在地下缓慢形成。
Example 2:  The Earth's crust was uplifting as the laccolith was growing. 随着岩盖的生长，地壳正在隆起。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Example 1: Before the erosion occurred, the laccolith had already formed. 在侵蚀发生之前，岩盖就已经形成了。
Example 2: The magma had intruded and solidified before the uplift began. 岩浆侵入并凝固，然后才开始隆起。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Example 1: The magma had been pushing upwards for centuries before the laccolith fully formed. 在岩盖完全形成之前，岩浆已经向上推了几个世纪。
Example 2: Geologists had been studying the area for years before they discovered the laccolith. 在发现岩盖之前，地质学家已经研究这个地区多年了。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Example 1:  Erosion will eventually expose more of the laccolith. 侵蚀最终会暴露出更多的岩盖。
Example 2: Future studies will likely reveal more about the laccolith's composition. 未来的研究可能会揭示更多关于岩盖成分的信息。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Example 1:  Geologists will be studying this laccolith for many years to come. 地质学家将在未来许多年里研究这个岩盖。
Example 2:  Researchers will be analyzing the rock samples to determine its age. 研究人员将分析岩石样本以确定其年龄。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
Example 1: By next year, the team will have completed their research on the laccolith. 到明年，该团队将完成他们对岩盖的研究。
Example 2: By the end of the decade, scientists will have gathered more data on its formation. 到本世纪末，科学家将收集到更多关于其形成的数据。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
Example 1: By the time the research is finished, scientists will have been studying the laccolith for over a decade.  到研究结束时，科学家们将已经研究了这个岩盖十多年了。
Example 2:  By 2050, geologists will have been mapping laccoliths around the world for many years. 到2050年，地质学家将已经绘制世界各地的岩盖图多年。
