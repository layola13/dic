PHRASE->
affected hypermodestness  做作的过分谦虚
exaggerated hypermodestness 夸张的过分谦虚
genuine hypermodestness (This phrase is somewhat contradictory as hypermodestness implies an exaggerated form of modesty, which contradicts genuineness.  However, it could be used to describe someone who genuinely feels uncomfortable with praise but expresses it in an exaggerated way.) 真正的过分谦虚（这个短语有点矛盾，因为过分谦虚意味着一种夸张的谦虚形式，这与真诚相矛盾。然而，它可以用来描述一个真正对赞扬感到不舒服，但却以夸张的方式表达出来的人。）
feigned hypermodestness  假装的过分谦虚
excessive hypermodestness (Similar to "genuine hypermodestness," this phrase is slightly redundant as hypermodestness already implies excessiveness.) 过度的过分谦虚（类似于“真正的过分谦虚”，这个短语略显多余，因为过分谦虚已经意味着过度。）


词源：hyper- (prefix meaning "over, excessive") + modesty + -ness (suffix forming nouns denoting state or quality)  hyper-（前缀，意思是“过度，过分”）+ modesty（谦虚）+ -ness（后缀，构成表示状态或性质的名词）
