ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *cēpan "to observe, attend to, take care of," from Proto-Germanic *kopjanan (source also of Old Frisian kepa "to buy," Middle Dutch kepen "to bargain, buy," Old High German koufen "to buy," German kaufen "to buy"), from PIE *kop- "to grasp, take hold of." The original sense of "hold, grasp" developed into "attend to, take care of," then "continue in a certain state, condition, course, etc." The noun sense of "fortified tower, stronghold" (c. 1300) is from Anglo-French quep, probably from Old North French variant of French caip "enclosure, fortified enclosure," from Latin campus "field."
