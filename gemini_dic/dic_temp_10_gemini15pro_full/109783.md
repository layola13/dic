词源:  late 14c., "fickleness, instability," from Old French levite "lightness, instability" (13c.), or directly from Latin levitatem (nominative levitas) "lightness," from levis "light" (in weight), figuratively "unimportant, trivial," from PIE root *legwh- "not heavy, having little weight."  The meaning "lightness of mind, frivolity" is first recorded in English in the 1520s.
