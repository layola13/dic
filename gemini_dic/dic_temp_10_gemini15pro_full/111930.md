lolita's:/ləˈliːtəz/ | n. |洛丽塔的；未成年少女的（带有性暗示）|  Belonging to or associated with a lolita.  This term is derived from Vladimir Nabokov's novel "Lolita," which tells the story of a middle-aged man's obsession with a young girl.  The term has become controversial due to its association with the sexualization of minors. |  He was caught with a collection of lolita's clothing. 他被发现收藏了洛丽塔风格的服装。|  Synonyms: (It's difficult to provide direct synonyms due to the specific and sensitive nature of the term. Words like "preteen's" or "young girl's" might be used in different contexts, but they don't carry the same connotations.) | Antonyms: (Similarly, direct antonyms are challenging.  Perhaps "adult's" could be considered in some contexts.) | noun
