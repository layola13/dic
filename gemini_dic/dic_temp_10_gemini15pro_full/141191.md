The word "oomiac" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis. It's possible that this is:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "omiac"?  Even this isn't a standard English word, so further context would be needed.
2. **A technical term or jargon:** It could be specific to a particular field or industry.
3. **A proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand.
4. **A neologism:**  A newly coined word.
5. **A fictional word:** Created for a story, game, or other creative work.

If you can provide more context, I may be able to offer more assistance.  For example, where did you encounter this word? What was the surrounding text?
