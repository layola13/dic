endospermic:/ˌɛndoʊˈspɜːrmɪk/ | adj. | 有胚乳的 | Having or relating to an endosperm; containing endosperm.  The endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. |  Example:  The seeds of corn are endospermic, providing nourishment for the developing seedling. 玉米的种子是有胚乳的，为发育中的幼苗提供营养。

Example:  Unlike beans, which are non-endospermic, grains like wheat and rice rely on the endosperm for germination.  不像豆类是无胚乳的，小麦和水稻等谷物依靠胚乳发芽。| 近义词: albuminous | 反义词: non-endospermic, exalbuminous | 词性: adjective
