词源：From Late Latin conventiculum "a small assembly," diminutive of conventus "a meeting, assembly," from past participle stem of convenire "to come together, assemble"  (from com- "together" + venire "to come").  Originally neutral, it acquired negative connotations in the 17th century, referring to illegal religious gatherings.
