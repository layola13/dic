Etymology->
From over- + skeptical + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much". "Skeptical" comes from the Greek "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring" or "reflective," relating to a school of philosophy that doubted the possibility of certain knowledge.  "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns indicating a state or quality.
