missampling:/ˌmɪsˈsæmplɪŋ/ | n. | 误采样，抽样误差 | The act of taking a sample that is not representative of the population from which it is drawn, leading to inaccurate or biased results.  | Example 1: Missampling can lead to skewed data in statistical analysis. 抽样误差会导致统计分析中的数据偏差。

Example 2: The survey suffered from missampling, as it only included participants from a specific demographic. 这项调查存在抽样误差，因为它只包括了来自特定人群的参与者。 | Near Synonyms: sampling bias, sampling error, unrepresentative sample | Antonyms: representative sampling, random sampling | Noun

PHRASE->
what if = 如果...会怎么样
what for = 为了什么
no matter what = 无论如何
what's more = 而且；更重要的是
what about = ...怎么样

由于missampling是一个专业术语，通常不会用于日常口语中的词组搭配。因此，此处提供的是what的常用词组，而不是missampling的词组。
