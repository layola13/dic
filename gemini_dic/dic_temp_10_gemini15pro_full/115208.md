词源:  From Late Latin manifestus "caught in the act, palpable, evident," literally "struck by the hand," past participle of manifestare "to lay hands on, make clear," from manus "hand" + -festus (akin to infestus "hostile").  来源于晚期拉丁语 manifestus “当场被捕，明显的，明显的”，字面意思是“被手击中”，manifestare 的过去分词“用手抓住，弄清楚”，来自 manus “手” + -festus（类似于 infestus “敌对的”）。
