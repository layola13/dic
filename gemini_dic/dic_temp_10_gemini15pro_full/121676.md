ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (wrongly) + plant (to put in the ground to grow).  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-", meaning "wrongly, badly, amiss," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-",  related to Old Norse "mis-". "Plant" comes from Old French "planter" from Latin "plantare" meaning "to fix in place, set, plant."
