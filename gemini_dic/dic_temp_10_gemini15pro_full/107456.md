ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lampreie, from Anglo-Norman lampreie, lamproie, from Old French lamproie, from Late Latin lamprēda, from a compound of Latin lampetra (“lamprey”) + Latin ēda (“I eat”).  The Latin lampetra is of uncertain origin, possibly from Greek λαμπρός (lamprós, “bright, clear”) + πέτρα (pétra, “stone, rock”), literally "stone-licker".
