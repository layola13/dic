词源:  Shortened from "glamour," which ultimately comes from the Scottish word "gramarye," meaning magic, enchantment, or spell.  This evolved into "grammar" in English, and then "glamour" emerged in the 19th century, influenced by the romantic association of grammar with ancient learning and mystery.
