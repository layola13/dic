词源:
From bristle (n.) + -y (adj. suffix) ultimately from Proto-Germanic *brist- "bristle."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "bristlinesses" is the plural form of "bristliness", referring to multiple instances of the quality of being bristly.
