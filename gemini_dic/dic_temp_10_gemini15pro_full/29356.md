castotsa is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a slang/dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you meant "cast lots," here's the analysis:

cast lots: /kæst lɒts/ (British) /kæst lɑːts/ (American) | verb phrase | 抽签，抓阄 | The act of drawing lots to make a decision or determine something randomly.  This phrase comes from ancient practices where small objects were drawn from a container to determine fate or distribute resources. | Example: They cast lots to decide who would go first. 他们抽签决定谁先去。

Example:  In the Bible, the soldiers cast lots for Jesus' clothes. 在圣经中，士兵们为耶稣的衣服抽签。
