Etymology: From Old English *hungrig* "suffering from hunger," from *hungor* "hunger" (related to *hingrian* "to hunger"), ultimately from Proto-Germanic *hungruz* (source also of Old Norse *hungr*, Old Saxon *hungar*, Old Frisian *hunger*, Dutch *honger*, German *Hunger*), from Proto-Indo-European *kenk-/*kangk- "to hang, be crooked, curved." The sense development is perhaps from the "gnawing pain" of hunger.
