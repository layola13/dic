overhardness:/ˈoʊvərˈhɑːrdnəs/| n. |过度硬度，过硬|Excessive hardness; hardness beyond what is desirable or necessary. |The overhardness of the steel made it brittle and prone to cracking.  这种钢的过度硬度使其变脆，容易开裂。|The overhardness of the bread made it difficult to chew.  面包太硬了，很难嚼。|近义词：excessive hardness, brittleness (in some contexts)|反义词: softness, malleability|词性:noun

Etymology:
"over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *ubar "over, above") + "hard" (Old English heard "hard, firm, solid, severe," from Proto-Germanic *harduz) + "-ness" (Old English -nes(s), a noun-forming suffix denoting state, quality, or condition).
