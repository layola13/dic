Etymology:  "long" + "drawn" + "out".  "Long" traces back to Old English "lang". "Drawn" is the past participle of "draw," from Old English "dragan," meaning "to pull, drag." "Out" is from Old English "ūt," meaning "outward, outside."  The combination emphasizes the sense of something being stretched or extended over time.
