注意事项:

"Logge" is an archaic word and rarely used in modern English.  "Cabin," "hut," or "shelter" are more common terms.  The provided pronunciation reflects its Middle English pronunciation as there is no modern standard.  The word's etymology traces back to Old French "loge" and ultimately to Frankish "*laubja," meaning "shelter of foliage."
