nonanalytically:/ˌnɒnˌænəˈlɪtɪkli/ | adv. | 非分析地；非解析地 | Not by analysis; in a way that does not involve analysis. |  He arrived at the solution nonanalytically, through intuition. 他并非通过分析，而是通过直觉得出了解决方案。 |  intuitively, synthetically, holistically | analytically | adverb

Etymology:
From non- + analytically.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "analytically" is the adverbial form of "analytical," which derives from "analysis."  "Analysis" ultimately comes from the Greek "analusis," meaning "a loosening up, dissolving."
