词源:  "disconnectedness" comes from "disconnected" + "-ness." "Disconnected" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") + "connected."  "Connected" derives from the Latin "connectere," meaning "to bind together." "-ness" is a suffix that forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
