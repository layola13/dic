ETYMOLOGY->
"dumbed-down" is a compound adjective formed from the verb "dumb" (meaning to make silent or stupid) and the adverb "down."  "Dumb" itself comes from Old English "dumb," meaning "mute, silent," related to the Old High German "tumb" (modern German "dumm," meaning "stupid").  The "down" element reinforces the sense of reduction or lowering in quality.
