adjective
同径的，等径的，共径的
Having the same radius or radii. Sharing a common radius.
Example: The two circles are corradial, meaning they have the same radius. 这两个圆是等径的，意味着它们有相同的半径。

Example:  Corradial circles are useful in geometric constructions. 等径圆在几何构造中很有用。
近义词: concentric (when circles share the same center), isometric (of equal measure)
反义词:  N/A (Lack of a direct antonym; could be described as having different radii)
词性: adjective
