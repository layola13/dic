cheerfully:/ˈtʃɪrfəli/ | adv. | 愉快地，高兴地 | In a cheerful way; with cheerfulness. | She cheerfully greeted her guests. 她愉快地迎接了她的客人。 | He cheerfully agreed to help. 他欣然同意帮忙。 | 近义词: happily, merrily, joyfully, gladly | 反义词: sadly, gloomily, morosely, dejectedly | 词性: 副词

词源: From Middle English *cher(e)fulli*, from Old English *ċēarfullīċe* (“carefully, anxiously, sorrowfully”), from *ċēarfullīċ* + *-e*, equivalent to cheerful +‎ -ly. The sense development to “happily” is probably due to influence from French *chérir* (“to cherish”).
