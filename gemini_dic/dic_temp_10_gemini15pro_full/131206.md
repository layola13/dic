nonbusier:/nɒnˈbɪziər/ (This word is not standard English) | adj. |  非更忙的 (This translation is a literal interpretation, but the word itself is not used) |  "Nonbusier" isn't a recognized word in English. The correct way to express the opposite of "busier" is "less busy" or "not busier".  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," but it doesn't combine with comparative adjectives like "busier." |  (No example sentence possible as the word is incorrect) | 近义词: less busy, not as busy | 反义词: busier, more busy | 词性: (incorrectly formed) adjective


词源:  The attempted word "nonbusier" seems to be a mistaken combination of the prefix "non-" (Latin origin, meaning "not") and the comparative adjective "busier." "Busy" itself comes from Old English "bisig."
