词源:
From Middle English *kēpen*, from Old English *cēpan* (“to observe, attend to, care for, heed, hold, keep, retain”), from Proto-West Germanic *kōpjan*, from Proto-Germanic *kōpijaną* (“to buy, barter”). Cognate with West Frisian *keapje* (“to buy”), Dutch *kopen* (“to buy”), German *kaufen* (“to buy”).  The meaning shifted from "buy" to "hold, retain" and then broadened to its modern senses.
