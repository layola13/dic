hashes:/ˈhæʃɪz/ /ˈhæʃəz/ | n. | 哈希值，散列值；井号 | A hash is a value generated by a mathematical function that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size output.  It's used in cryptography and data structures.  Also, the symbol '#'.| Example: The password is stored as a hash for security.  密码以哈希值的形式存储以确保安全。

Example: Use a hash (#) to mark keywords on social media.  使用井号 (#) 在社交媒体上标记关键字。| Synonyms: hash values, hash codes, number signs, pound signs | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms for a technical term like hash.  Perhaps "original data" could be considered a conceptual opposite in some contexts.) | noun
