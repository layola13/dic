heterostyled:/ˌhetərəˈstaɪld/ | adj. | 异型花的，异柱花的 | Having styles of different lengths in different flowers of the same species, promoting outcrossing. |  Primroses are heterostyled, meaning they have different flower forms to encourage cross-pollination. 报春花是异型花的，这意味着它们有不同的花型以促进异花授粉。| synonymous: dimorphic, trimorphic | antonymous: homostyled | adjective
heterostylism:/ˌhetərəˈstaɪlɪzəm/ | n. | 异柱花，异型花柱 | The condition of having styles of different lengths in different flowers of the same species. | Heterostylism is a common mechanism to prevent self-fertilization in plants. 异柱花是植物防止自花授粉的常见机制。| synonymous: dimorphism, trimorphism | antonymous: homostyly | noun
