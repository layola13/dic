hyperintensenesses:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛnsnɪsiz/ | n. |  高信号强度（复数） | Areas appearing unusually bright on a medical image (like an MRI), indicating a specific tissue characteristic.  It's not a disease itself, but a sign that something might be going on.  |  Example: The MRI showed multiple hyperintensenesses in the white matter.  核磁共振成像显示白质有多处高信号。| Example: The doctor noted the hyperintensenesses on the scan and ordered further tests. 医生注意到扫描上的高信号区域，并安排了进一步检查。 | Synonym:  bright spots, hyperintense areas | Antonym: hypointensenesses | Noun

hyperintensity:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛnsɪti/ | n. | 高信号强度（单数） | An area appearing unusually bright on a medical image (like an MRI). | Example: The hyperintensity in the brain was further investigated.  大脑中的高信号区域被进一步调查。 | Example:  The radiologist identified a focal hyperintensity on the patient's MRI. 放射科医生在病人的核磁共振成像上发现了一个局灶性高信号区。| Synonym: bright spot, hyperintense area | Antonym: hypointensity | Noun
