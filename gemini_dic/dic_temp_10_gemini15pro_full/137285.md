nonsynchronousnesses:/nɒnˈsɪŋkrənəsnəsɪz/
n.|非同步性，异步性|The state or quality of not being synchronous; lack of synchronization.  This refers to events or processes that do not occur at the same time or at a predictable regular interval relative to each other.|The network experienced several nonsynchronousnesses, leading to data loss.|近义词:asynchronies, non-simultaneity|反义词:synchronicity, synchronism|词性:名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From non- (prefix meaning "not") + synchronous (adjective meaning "existing or occurring at the same time") + -ness (suffix forming nouns expressing state or quality).  The word "synchronous" ultimately derives from the Greek words "syn" (together) and "chronos" (time).
