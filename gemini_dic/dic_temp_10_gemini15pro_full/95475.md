词源：From Latin incitāre, frequentative of inciēre (“to set in motion, begin, undertake”).

注意事项:  incito is not a common English word. It's more likely to be encountered in academic or formal contexts.  While it can sometimes have a neutral meaning of "encourage," it more often carries a negative connotation of provoking undesirable behavior.
