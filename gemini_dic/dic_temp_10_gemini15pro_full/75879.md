functor:/ˈfʌŋktər/| n.|函子|A functor is a mapping between categories. In programming, it's often represented as a type class that defines how to map functions over a data structure, preserving its structure.|Example: In Haskell, `Functor` is a type class that allows you to apply a function to every element inside a data structure like a list or a tree, without changing the structure itself.  在Haskell中，`Functor`是一个类型类，它允许您将一个函数应用于列表或树等数据结构中的每个元素，而不会改变结构本身。|Example: In C++, functors are often implemented as classes that overload the function call operator, allowing them to be used like functions.  在C++中，函子通常被实现为重载函数调用运算符的类，允许它们像函数一样使用。|Synonym: mapping, transformation|Antonym: N/A|noun
