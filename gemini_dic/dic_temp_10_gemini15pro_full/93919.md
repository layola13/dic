ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *immunis* "exempt from public service, free, untouched," from *in-* "not" (see in- (1)) + *munis* "performing services, obliging, ready to serve," related to *moenia* "walls, fortifications," *munire* "to fortify, defend." Originally in English (c. 1600) in the literal sense of "exempt from charges or burdens."  The biological sense of "exempt from a disease" is first attested 1755.
