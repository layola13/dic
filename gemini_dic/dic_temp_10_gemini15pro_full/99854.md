Etymology:
"inter-" (Latin, meaning "between, among") + "modification" (from Late Latin "modificationem,"  meaning "a shaping, measuring,"  from "modificare" "to measure, restrain, limit," from "modus" "measure" + "facere" "to make").  Thus, "intermodifications" refers to modifications happening between or among elements.
