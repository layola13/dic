PHRASE-> (Not applicable to "colossi's" due to its specific grammatical function as a possessive form.)


注意事项:  The word "colossi" is already plural.  Therefore, adding an apostrophe-s ('s) creates the possessive form of the plural. It's not common to see "colossi's" frequently used because the singular "colossus" is more typically employed.  The examples above demonstrate grammatically correct usage but might appear slightly contrived due to the word's infrequent appearance in the possessive plural form.
