PHRASE->
(Argon doesn't typically form common phrases in everyday language as it's a chemical element.  The phrases below demonstrate usage in technical contexts.)

argon gas = 氩气
argon atmosphere = 氩气环境
argon welding = 氩弧焊
argon laser = 氩离子激光器
liquid argon = 液态氩

注意事项:  Argon is a chemical element and its usage is primarily restricted to scientific and industrial contexts. Therefore, it does not lend itself to the same grammatical variety as common words.  Phrases are also limited to technical terminology.
