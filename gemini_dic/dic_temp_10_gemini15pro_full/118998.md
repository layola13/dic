From Middle English *methinken*, from Old English *mē þyncþ* (meaning "it seems to me"), where *mē* is the dative of *ic* ("I") and *þyncþ* is the third-person singular present indicative of *þyncan* ("to seem").  Related to German *mich dünkt*.  The word has fallen out of common usage and is now considered archaic or literary.
