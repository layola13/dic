词源:  "Chiller" comes from the verb "to chill," which means to make something cold.  The noun form refers to something that chills, like a machine or a scary story. "Chill" itself has roots in Old English *ciele, related to the Old High German kēlan and ultimately to the Proto-Germanic *kōl-, meaning "cool."
