ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *abacinatio*, from abacinare (“to blind by putting a hot metal basin near the eyes”), from abacus (“basin”). The connection is uncertain, but may refer to the blinding effect of deception.  源自拉丁语 *abacinatio*，来自 abacinare（“通过将热金属盆放在眼睛附近使人失明”），来自 abacus（“盆”）。这种联系不确定，但可能指的是欺骗的致盲效应。
