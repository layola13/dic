ETYMOLOGY->
"art house" is a compound word combining "art" and "house."  "Art" comes from the Latin "ars," meaning "skill" or "craft." "House" comes from the Old English "hūs," meaning "dwelling" or "building."  The term began to be used in the mid-20th century to describe cinemas that showed foreign, independent, or experimental films, often considered to be of higher artistic merit than mainstream Hollywood productions.
