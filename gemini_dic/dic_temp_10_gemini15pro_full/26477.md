c-section: /ˈsiːˌsekʃən/ | n. | 剖腹产 |  Short for Caesarean section, a surgical procedure in which incisions are made through a woman's abdomen and uterus to deliver one or more babies. |  She had a c-section with her first child. 她第一个孩子是剖腹产的。|  Synonym: Caesarean section, Caesarean delivery, abdominal delivery | Antonym: vaginal birth, natural childbirth | noun

Etymology:  From "Caesarean section,"  believed to be derived from the Roman family name Caesar.  One legend holds that Julius Caesar was born this way, but this is likely untrue as his mother lived after his birth, which was uncommon in Roman times with this procedure.
