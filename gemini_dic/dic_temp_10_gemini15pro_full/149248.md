oyezed:  This word doesn't seem to exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism, or a word from a specific dialect or slang.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, its intended meaning), I may be able to offer some suggestions.

However, I can still provide the requested grammatical explanations and example sentences using the word "what" as requested, since that seems to be the focus of your second part of the prompt.
