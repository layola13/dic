词源:  The term "Locofoco" comes from a meeting of radical Democrats in New York City in 1835. When the Tammany Hall Democrats turned off the gaslights in an attempt to end the meeting, the Locofocos lit candles and continued using "loco foco" matches, which were newly invented self-lighting matches. The name then became associated with the radical faction.  “Locofoco”一词来源于1835年在纽约市举行的激进民主党人会议。当坦慕尼协会的民主党人关掉煤气灯试图结束会议时，激进民主党人点燃了蜡烛，并继续使用新发明的自燃火柴“loco foco”。后来，这个名字就与激进派联系在一起了。
