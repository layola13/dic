countergage:/ˈkaʊntərɡeɪdʒ/ | n. | 对量规，止规，反向量规 | A gage used to check the accuracy of another gage.  A countergage verifies the dimensions of a working gage to ensure it remains within tolerance and continues to provide accurate measurements.  It can also refer to a gage designed to check a specific part or feature, essentially acting as a negative of that part. | Example 1: The machinist used a countergage to verify the dimensions of the newly calibrated caliper. 机械师使用对量规来验证新校准的卡尺的尺寸。

Example 2: The countergage showed that the working gage was out of tolerance and needed to be replaced. 对量规显示工作量规超出公差，需要更换。| Synonym: check gage, inspection gage | Antonym: working gage | Noun
