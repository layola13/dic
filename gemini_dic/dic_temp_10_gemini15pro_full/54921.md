Etymology:

From dispose + -er + -'s.  "Dispose" comes from Old French *disposer (Modern French disposer), from Latin dispōnere "to arrange, distribute, regulate," from dis- "apart, away" + pōnere "to put, place."  The "-er" suffix creates a noun meaning "one who disposes," and the "-'s" is the possessive marker.
