kmt:/keɪ ɛm tiː/ | abbreviation |  | KMT is an abbreviation, often used online, particularly in gaming communities. It's an initialism and doesn't have a single, universally agreed-upon meaning. It can be interpreted in various ways depending on context. Some common interpretations include "kiss my teeth," expressing annoyance or disapproval; "kill myself," expressing frustration or exasperation (though often not literally); or even "Kuomintang," referring to the Chinese Nationalist Party.  Because of its ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation, it's best used with caution, especially in formal settings. | "KMT, I can't believe I lost that match."  "He just kept interrupting, kmt." | 近义词: smh (shaking my head),  ugh | 反义词: N/A | abbreviation
