ETYMOLOGY->
From abuse + -ful.  "Abuse" comes from the Latin word "abusus," past participle of "abuti," meaning "to misuse" or "to use up."  "-ful" is a suffix meaning "full of" or "characterized by."

USAGE->
This word is generally used to describe behavior or language, not people directly.  While you might say "abusive behavior," it is less common and can sound awkward to say "an abuseful person."  Instead, "abusive person" is preferred.
