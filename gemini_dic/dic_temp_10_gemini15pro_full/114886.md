词源： The word "mampara" comes from Spanish.  It originally referred to a screen or partition, often used for privacy.  The use of "mampara" to also mean "bar counter," particularly in Latin American Spanish, likely developed from the idea of a counter acting as a partition between the bartender and the customers.
