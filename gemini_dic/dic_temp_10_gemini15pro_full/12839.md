Etymology: From association + -ism.  "association" comes from Late Latin associationem (nominative associatio) "union, combination," noun of action from past-participle stem of associare "join to, unite with," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + sociare "unite, associate," from socius "companion, ally" (see social (adj.)). The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, theory, or principle.
