PHRASE->
There are no commonly used phrases with "dipaschal" due to its specialized religious context.  However, it could be used in sentences describing the time period, such as:  "During the dipaschal period, many religious observances take place."  "The dipaschal season is a time of reflection and celebration."  Since it's not frequently used, creating common phrases feels forced and unnatural.
