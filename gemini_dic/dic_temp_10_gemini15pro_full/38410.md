Etymology:  From "concerned" + "-ness". "Concerned" comes from the late Middle English "concernen", from the Old French "concerner",  ultimately from the Latin "concernere" meaning "to sift together," from "con-" (together) + "cernere" (to separate, distinguish). The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
