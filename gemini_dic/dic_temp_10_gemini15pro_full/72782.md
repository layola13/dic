ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *foillier "to trample," from Latin *folliare, frequentative of fullo "cloth-fuller, one who shrinks and thickens cloth," ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *plē- "to fill."  The sense of "to prevent the success of" developed from the idea of trampling on something. The noun "foiler" comes from the verb "foil."  The fencing sword sense developed from its resemblance to a leaf.
