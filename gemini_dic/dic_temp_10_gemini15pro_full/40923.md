PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Coolingly" is typically not used in set phrases.  It's an adverb describing a manner of action, not a phrase element itself.


词源: From "cool" + "-ing" + "-ly."  "Cool" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages, referring to low temperature. The adverbial ending "-ly" derives from Old English "-lice," meaning "in a... manner."
