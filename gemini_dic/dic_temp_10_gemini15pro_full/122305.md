Etymology:
From Middle English *mitten, from Old English *mittan, from Proto-Germanic *mitaną (“to send, let go”), from Proto-Indo-European *meyth₂- (“to exchange, change”). Cognate with Dutch mitten (“to allow, permit”), German mitteilen (“to communicate, inform”), Gothic mittelt (“in the middle”).  The past participle form "mitted" arises from the verb "mit," an archaic variant of "emit" or "omit."  More commonly seen now is the past participle "omitted."
