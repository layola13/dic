Etymology:
From Late Latin *hallucinatio*, "wandering of the mind, error, delusion," from Latin *alucinari*, "to wander in mind, dream, talk idly," from *alucinatus*, past participle of *hallucinari*, from *ad-* "to" + *lucinari* "to mock, deceive," from *luces* "light, daylight" (perhaps because hallucinations were viewed as deceptive light).  + *-gen* "producing."
