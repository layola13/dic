nonreducibly:/ˌnɑːnriˈdjuːsəbli/ | adv. | 不可约地，不可化简地 |  In a way that cannot be reduced or simplified further. | This polynomial is nonreducibly complex.  这个多项式不可约地复杂。| 近义词: irreducibly | 反义词: reducibly | 词性: 副词

词源:  From "non-" (not) + "reducible" (capable of being reduced) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Reducible" ultimately comes from the Latin "reducere" (to lead back).
