ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *aetheo-* (meaning "unusual, strange") + *-gamos* (meaning "marriage, union").  The prefix *aetheo-* is related to *ateles* (incomplete), and ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂et-* (to go beyond). *-gamos* derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *ǵem-* (to come, go).
