ETYMOLOGY->
From French "accoutrements," plural of "accoutrement," from Old French "acoustrement" meaning "equipment," from "acoustrer" meaning "to equip," ultimately from Vulgar Latin "*accostare" meaning "to come alongside," from Latin "ad" (to) + "costa" (rib, side).  The original sense was of things placed at one's side.
