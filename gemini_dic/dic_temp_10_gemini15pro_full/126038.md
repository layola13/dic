Not applicable. "Must-ached" is not commonly used in phrases.  It's typically used predicatively following a verb like "be," "feel," or "become."


注意事项:
Although grammatically correct in all tenses, "must-ached" sounds slightly unnatural and is less common than using "sore," "achy," or "stiff."  It is more commonly used in informal spoken English.
