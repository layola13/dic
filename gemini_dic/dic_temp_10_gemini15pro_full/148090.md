词性:adjective

词源:
From over- + scrupulous.  "Over-" acts as an intensifier, meaning "excessively" or "too much." "Scrupulous" comes from the Latin "scrupulus," meaning a small sharp stone, hence a source of anxiety or uneasiness.  Therefore, "overscrupulous" describes someone excessively worried about small moral points.
