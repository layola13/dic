词源：
"Centre" comes from the Old French word "centre" and the Latin "centrum," meaning "center point." "Left" comes from the Old English "lyft," meaning "weak" (originally referring to the weaker left hand).  In political terms, "left" began to be used during the French Revolution, referring to those who sat on the left side of the presiding officer in the National Assembly, generally supporting revolutionary ideals.  "Centre-left" therefore signifies a position politically between the center and the left.
