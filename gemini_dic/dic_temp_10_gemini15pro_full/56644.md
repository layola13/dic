donnishly:/ˈdɒnɪʃli/| adv.|学究式地，迂腐地|In a manner resembling or suggesting a don, especially in being bookish, pedantic, or pompous.|He spoke donnishly about the intricacies of medieval literature. 他以一种学究式的口吻谈论中世纪文学的复杂性。|近义词：pedantically, academically, scholastically, pompously|反义词：simply, plainly, unpretentiously|词性:副词
词源: From don + -ish + -ly.  "Don" originally referred to a head, fellow, or tutor of a college or university, often associated with scholarship and sometimes with a slightly aloof or pompous manner.  The suffix "-ish" creates an adjective meaning "like a don," and "-ly" transforms it into an adverb.
