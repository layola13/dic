近义词: unwisely, imprudently, foolishly, inappropriately
反义词: wisely, prudently, judiciously, appropriately
词性: adverb

词源:
From in- (not) + expedient + -ly (adverbial suffix).  Expedient comes from Latin *expedient- (stem of expediens), present participle of expedire "to extricate, disengage, set free," from ex- "out" + ped- (root of pes "foot").  Therefore, the original sense was of "freeing the feet," hence "helpful, advantageous."
