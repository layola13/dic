一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The query returned several nulls. = 查询返回了几个空值。
The system identified all the nulls in the dataset. = 系统识别了数据集中的所有空值。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The database was handling nulls efficiently when the error occurred. = 发生错误时，数据库正在有效地处理空值。
The program was processing records with nulls when it crashed. = 程序崩溃时正在处理包含空值的记录。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The query had returned several nulls before the system crashed. = 系统崩溃前，查询已返回了几个空值。

The program had been handling nulls correctly for a long time. = 程序长期以来一直正确地处理空值。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The system will handle nulls appropriately. = 系统将适当地处理空值。
The query will return nulls for missing values. = 查询将返回空值以表示缺失的值。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be handling nulls efficiently. = 程序将高效地处理空值。
The database will be storing nulls for missing data. = 数据库将存储空值以表示缺失的数据。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By tomorrow, the system will have processed all the nulls. = 到明天，系统将处理所有空值。
By next week, the database will have updated all null fields. = 到下周，数据库将更新所有空值字段。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next year, the database will have been storing nulls for a decade. = 到明年，数据库将已经存储空值十年了。
By the end of the project, the program will have been handling nulls consistently. = 到项目结束时，程序将一直一致地处理空值。


虚拟语气:
If the field contained a null, the program would throw an error. = 如果该字段包含空值，程序将抛出错误。
I wish the database wouldn't return so many nulls. = 我希望数据库不要返回这么多空值。

被动语态:
Nulls are handled by the system automatically. = 空值由系统自动处理。
Null values are often represented by a special symbol. = 空值通常用特殊符号表示。

疑问句:
Are there any nulls in the dataset? = 数据集中有空值吗？
How many nulls were returned by the query? = 查询返回了多少个空值？

否定句:
The field does not contain a null. = 该字段不包含空值。
The query did not return any nulls. = 查询没有返回任何空值。

PHRASE->
check for nulls = 检查空值
handle nulls = 处理空值
return nulls = 返回空值
store nulls = 存储空值
null values = 空值
