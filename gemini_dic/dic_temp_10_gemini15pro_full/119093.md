PHRASE->
N/A (Since "metrics's" is a possessive form, it doesn't typically form set phrases.  It would be more common to see phrases involving "metrics" itself, such as "key metrics," "performance metrics," etc.)


注意事项:  The possessive form "metrics's" can sound awkward and is often avoided.  It's generally preferable to rephrase using "of the metrics" (e.g., "the performance of the metrics").  This is especially true in formal writing.
