PHRASE->
(Not commonly used in phrases.  This adverb usually modifies a verb directly.)

词源:  "Half-" (Old English healf) + "convincingly" (from "convince" - Latin convincere, "to overcome, conquer," figuratively "to prove wrong, refute," later "to persuade").  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "convincing" into the adverb "convincingly."
