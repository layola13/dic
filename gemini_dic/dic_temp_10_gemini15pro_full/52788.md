ETYMOLOGY->
From Italian *dilettante*, present participle of *dilettare* "to delight," from Latin *delectare* "to delight, charm, please."  Originally used in a positive sense, referring to someone who pursued the arts for pleasure, it has acquired a somewhat negative connotation over time, suggesting a lack of seriousness and depth.
