ETYMOLOGY->
From the noun "cavalier" (meaning a knight or horseman, especially a courtly gentleman), which itself comes from the French "chevalier" (meaning knight). The word acquired a negative connotation over time, referring to the perceived arrogance and disregard for others often associated with the aristocratic class.  The verb form "cavaliered" emerged later, signifying treating something or someone in a manner reflective of this negative connotation.
