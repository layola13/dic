ETYMOLOGY->

From fade + -ness.  "Fade" comes from the Old French *fader (unattested), probably from a Vulgar Latin *fatīgāre, frequentative of Latin fatīgāre "to weary," from fatīgus "weary, tired."  The suffix "-ness" is a native English suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
