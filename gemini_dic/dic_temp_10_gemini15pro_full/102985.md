词源：
The word "jeep" likely originated during World War II.  One theory suggests it's derived from the abbreviation "GP," meaning "General Purpose," used to designate this type of military vehicle.  Another theory posits it came from the cartoon character "Eugene the Jeep" in Popeye, known for its ability to go anywhere.
