词源:  From extra- + ordinary.  "Extra-" denotes "outside" or "beyond," and "ordinary" refers to what is usual or common. Thus, "extraordinary" literally means "beyond the ordinary."  The plural form "extraordinaries" specifically refers to unusual items or expenses, especially in a financial context.
