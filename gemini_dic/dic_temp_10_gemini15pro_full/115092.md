manganate:/ˈmæŋɡəneɪt/ |n.|锰酸盐|A salt or ester of manganic acid.|Potassium manganate is a green crystalline solid.|近义词: permanganate (高锰酸盐, 但化学性质不同，并非严格近义词) |反义词: 无| 词性: 名词

ETYMOLOGY->
From manganese + -ate (suffix forming nouns denoting salts or esters of acids).  Manganese itself comes from the Italian "manganese," ultimately from the Greek "magnes," meaning magnet (due to confusion with magnetic iron ore).
