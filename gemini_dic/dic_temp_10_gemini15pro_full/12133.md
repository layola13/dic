PHRASE->
Not applicable. "Arty" is rarely used in set phrases.  The word itself carries the connotation of affected behavior, making it difficult to use in common phrases without sounding redundant or overly critical.

注意事项:
"Artys" is grammatically incorrect as a singular adjective. The correct form is "arty." However, it's sometimes used informally as a humorous or emphatic form.

Since "artys" is not a common word and is often considered incorrect, examples may feel somewhat contrived.
