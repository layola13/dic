PHRASE->
(Due to the sensitive and often offensive nature of this word, common phrases using it are generally vulgar and not suitable for inclusion here.  Its figurative use as "a difficult task" is much more common in modern usage.)


what a buggery! (vulgar exclamation of frustration)
the buggery of it all (referring to the difficulty or unpleasantness of a situation)

Note:  The word "buggery" carries strong connotations and can be considered offensive.  It is important to use it with caution and sensitivity, particularly when referring to its literal meaning.  Its figurative use to describe a difficult task is becoming more common, but it still retains some of its original negative connotations.
