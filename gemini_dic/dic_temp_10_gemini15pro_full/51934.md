Most style guides recommend using "diabetes" for both singular and plural. | 近义词: (singular) diabetes | 反义词:  N/A | 词性: noun


Etymology: From Late Latin *diabētēs, from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabētēs, “siphon, compass”), from διαβαίνειν (diabainein, “to stride across, pass through”), from διά (diá, “through”) + βαίνειν (bainein, “to go, walk”). So called because of excessive urination, as if the liquid were passing right through the body. The plural form "diabeteses" is formed by adding "-es" to the singular "diabetes".
