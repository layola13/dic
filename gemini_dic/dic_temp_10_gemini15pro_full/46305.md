注意事项:

"daad" itself isn't a recognized English word. It seems like a misspelling of "data." This entire response is based on the assumption that "data" was intended.  If a different word was intended, please clarify.  Also, "data" is already plural.  The singular form is "datum," though it is rarely used.
