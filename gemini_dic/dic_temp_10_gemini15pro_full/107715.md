ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *lanterne*, from Old North French *lanterne*, from Latin *lanterna* (“lantern, lamp”), from Ancient Greek *λαμπτήρ* (*lamptḗr*, “torch, lamp”), from *λάμπω* (*lámpō*, “I shine”). The intrusive *-n-* probably arose from association with *horn* due to lanterns often having horn panes.
