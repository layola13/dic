astrophysicses: /ˌæstrəʊˈfɪzɪksɪz/ | n. | 天体物理学(复数，罕用) |  The branch of physics that deals with the physical properties and phenomena of celestial bodies, including stars, planets, galaxies, and the universe as a whole.  It applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life, and death of stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in the universe.|  Astrophysicses is rarely used as the plural form. Astrophysics is typically treated as an uncountable noun.  It would be more common to say "various branches of astrophysics" or "different areas within astrophysics" than "astrophysicses." | 近义词: astronomy (although slightly broader), cosmology (focuses on the universe as a whole) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: Noun


Etymology:
astro-  from Greek "astron" meaning "star"
physics  from Greek "physikē" meaning "knowledge of nature"
