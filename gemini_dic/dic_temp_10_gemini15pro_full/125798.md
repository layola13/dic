词源:  "murk" comes from the Old Norse *myrkr, meaning "darkness," and "-er" is a common agentive suffix, indicating someone or something that performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, "murker" literally means "something that makes dark" or, figuratively, "someone who kills," drawing a parallel between death and darkness.
