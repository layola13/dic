ETYMOLOGY->
"On the horns of a dilemma" originates from the image of being gored by either horn of a bull.  "Dilemma" itself comes from the Greek "dilemma," meaning "double proposition," from "di-" (two) and "lēmma" (proposition). This highlights the core concept of being forced to choose between two undesirable options.
