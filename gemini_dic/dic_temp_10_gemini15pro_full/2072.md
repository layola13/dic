acyclic:/ˌeɪˈsaɪklɪk/ | adj. | 非循环的，无环的 | Containing no cycles or loops.  Describing a graph or other structure that does not contain any paths that start and end at the same node without traversing any edge more than once. |  This algorithm works only on acyclic graphs.  这个算法只适用于非循环图。

The data structure is designed to be acyclic to prevent infinite loops.  该数据结构被设计成非循环的以防止无限循环。| 近义词: non-cyclic, noncircular | 反义词: cyclic, circular | 词性: 形容词

ETYMOLOGY->
From a- (not) + cyclic (circular, pertaining to a cycle).  "Cyclic" ultimately comes from the Greek "kyklos" meaning "circle, wheel, cycle".

USAGE->
The acyclic nature of the dependency graph ensures that there are no circular dependencies.  依赖图的非循环特性确保没有循环依赖。

The project plan was designed to be acyclic to avoid scheduling conflicts.  项目计划被设计成非循环的以避免进度冲突。


PHRASE->
acyclic graph = 非循环图
acyclic directed graph (DAG) = 有向无环图
ensure acyclic = 确保非循环
acyclic relationship = 非循环关系
detect acyclic structures = 检测非循环结构
