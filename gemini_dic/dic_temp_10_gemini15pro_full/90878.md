The word "hunkerousnesses" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It seems to be a non-standard or humorous formation, likely derived from "hunker down" and intended to mean something like "states of being hunkered down" or "instances of hunkering down."  Since it's not a real word, providing a formal lexical analysis is impossible. However, I can break down the likely intended meaning and potential usage based on its apparent root word.

Let's analyze "hunker down" instead:

hunker down: /ˈhʌŋkər daʊn/
hunker down:| v. | 蹲下；躲藏；坚持做某事 | To crouch or squat down, often for shelter or protection; to settle in and persevere through a difficult situation. | Example: They hunkered down in the basement during the tornado.  他们在龙卷风期间躲在地下室里。| Example: We need to hunker down and finish this project. 我们需要坚持完成这个项目。| Synonym: crouch, squat, hide, shelter, persevere, dig in | Antonym: stand up, emerge, give up | verb
