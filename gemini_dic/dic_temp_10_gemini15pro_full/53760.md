词源:
From Old French desconfit, past participle of desconfire  "to defeat, rout, undo," from des- "expressing reversal" + con- "with, together" + faire "to do, make" (from Latin facere "to make, do"). The original meaning was "to defeat utterly," but it evolved to mean "to frustrate the plans of" and then "to embarrass or make uneasy."
