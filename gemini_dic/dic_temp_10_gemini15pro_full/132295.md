PHRASE-> (Not applicable. "Nondeference" is rarely used in set phrases. It’s more of a formal descriptive word.)


词源:  From non- + deference.  "Deference" comes from the Late Latin  "deferentia," meaning "respect, compliance," from the Latin "deferre" meaning "to carry down, bring down, offer, submit." Thus, "nondeference" signifies the absence of this respectful submission.
