PHRASE->
(This word is not commonly used in phrases.  It's primarily a technical medical term.)


词源：
From inter- + orbit + -al + -ly.  "Inter-" means "between", "orbit" refers to the eye socket, "-al" forms an adjective, and "-ly" forms an adverb from the adjective.  Therefore, "interorbitally" means "in a manner relating to the space between the orbits."
