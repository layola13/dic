erythrophyll: /ɪˈrɪθrəfɪl/ /ɪˈriːθrəfɪl/
noun
叶红素; 红叶素
A red pigment found in some algae and higher plants.
例句：Erythrophyll is responsible for the red coloration of autumn leaves.  叶红素是造成秋叶红色的原因。

例句：The changing levels of erythrophyll and chlorophyll contribute to the vibrant colors of fall foliage. 叶红素和叶绿素水平的变化导致了秋季树叶鲜艳的色彩。
