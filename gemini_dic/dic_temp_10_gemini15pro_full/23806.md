词源:
From Middle English *brasen, from Old English bræsen (“of brass; made of brass”), from Proto-Germanic *brasiną (“of brass”), from *brasą (“brass”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰerH- (“brown; bright”). Cognate with Dutch brassen (“of brass”), German bressen (“of brass”), Latin ferrum (“iron”), Ancient Greek φλέγω (phlégō, “I burn”). More at brass. The figurative sense of "shameless" arose from the association of brass with prostitutes (cf. brassy).  The adverb brazenly is formed by adding the suffix -ly to the adjective brazen.
