chalazogamy:/ˌkæləˈzɒɡəmi/ | n. |合点受精|  A type of fertilization in which the pollen tube enters the ovule through the chalaza, instead of through the micropyle, which is the usual route. | Example 1: Chalazogamy is an unusual phenomenon observed in certain plant families.  合点受精是在某些植物科中观察到的一种不寻常现象。

Example 2: Researchers are studying the evolutionary significance of chalazogamy. 研究人员正在研究合点受精的进化意义。|Synonym:  (No direct synonym, but related terms include porogamy and mesogamy) | Antonym: Porogamy (specifically, micropylar porogamy) |noun
