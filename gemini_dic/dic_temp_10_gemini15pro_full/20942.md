词源:  "Bleed white" is a figurative expression derived from the literal act of bleeding.  The image evoked is that of bleeding until all the blood is gone, leaving only the pale white tissue underneath.  This visual then becomes a metaphor for complete depletion or exhaustion, especially of financial resources.
