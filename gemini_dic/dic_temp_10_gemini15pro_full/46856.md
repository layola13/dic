darcy:/ˈdɑːrsi/| n.|达西 (渗透率单位)|A unit of permeability, named after Henry Darcy, equal to the permeability of a porous medium that transmits a fluid of one centipoise viscosity at a rate of one cubic centimeter per second per square centimeter under a pressure gradient of one atmosphere per centimeter.|The permeability of the sandstone is 100 darcies.|近义词: permeability unit|反义词: (No direct antonym, as it's a unit of measurement)|词性:noun
