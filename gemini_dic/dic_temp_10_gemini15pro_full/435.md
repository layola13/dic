ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "ablate," which comes from Latin "ablatus," the past participle of "auferre" (to carry away), from "ab-" (away) + "ferre" (to carry).

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ablator protects the spacecraft during re-entry. = 烧蚀器在重返大气层时保护宇宙飞船。
Laser ablators are commonly used in medical procedures. = 激光消融器常用于医疗程序。


一般过去时:
