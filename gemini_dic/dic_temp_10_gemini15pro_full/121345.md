Etymology:
From mis- + governance, from govern + -ance.  "Mis-" is a prefix of Old English and Old French origin meaning "wrong," "bad," or "wrongly." "Govern" comes from the Old French "governer," ultimately from the Latin "gubernare" meaning "to steer, guide, direct, govern."  "-ance" is a suffix forming nouns from verbs.
