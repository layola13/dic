词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "forensic" (from Latin "forensis," meaning "of the forum, public").  "Forensic" originally referred to anything related to courts or public debate, and later became specialized to legal and criminal investigation.  Therefore, "nonforensic" simply means "not related to forensic science or legal proceedings."
