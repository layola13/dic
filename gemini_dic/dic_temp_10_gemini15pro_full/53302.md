注意事项:

"Dis's" is very informal and generally considered non-standard English. It's more common in certain dialects or spoken language.  Avoid using it in formal writing.  While grammatically representing "this is", applying it to all tenses and grammatical constructions isn't appropriate.  The examples provided above demonstrate its primary use.  It's generally advisable to use "this is" instead of "dis's" for clarity and standard English adherence.
