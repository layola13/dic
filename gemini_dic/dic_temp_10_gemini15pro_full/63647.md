eotf:/iː oʊ tiː ɛf/ | n. | 电光转换函数 (Electro-Optical Transfer Function) | A function that describes the relationship between the luminance of a display and the digital code values driving it.  It defines how digital image data is converted into light output on a display. | Example 1: The EOTF used for HDR content is different from the one used for standard dynamic range content. HDR内容使用的EOTF与标准动态范围内容使用的EOTF不同。

Example 2:  Calibrating the EOTF is crucial for accurate color reproduction on a display. 校准EOTF对于在显示器上准确地再现颜色至关重要。 | Synonym:  Gamma curve, transfer function | Antonym:  OETF (Opto-Electrical Transfer Function) | Noun
