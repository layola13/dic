ETYMOLOGY->
From "cock a bill," where "cock" means to turn upward and "bill" refers to a weapon (like a crossbow or musket) or a ship's anchor.  The original meaning referred to a ship's anchor hanging loosely from the cathead, ready to be dropped. This image of something slightly raised and ready for action evolved to describe hats worn at a jaunty angle and then more generally to anything tilted or askew.
