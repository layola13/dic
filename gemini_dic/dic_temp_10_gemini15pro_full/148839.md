词源:  The word "overwalk" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") with the verb "walk." While "walk" itself has a complex etymology tracing back to Old English "wealcan," the combination with "over-" creates a straightforward meaning of excessive walking, which extends to general overexertion.
