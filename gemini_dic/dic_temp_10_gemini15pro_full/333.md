ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *abōminābilis, from Latin abōminor (“I deprecate as ominous, I detest, abhor”), from ab- (“away from”) + ōmen, ōminis (“omen, portent”). Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ṓwyos (“bird”).  The original sense was “ill-omened,” but the word quickly took on the general sense of “detestable.”
