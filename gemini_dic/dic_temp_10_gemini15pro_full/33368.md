词源：
Chunder is British slang.  It's believed to have originated in the Royal Navy in the 19th century, potentially derived from the sound of someone vomiting.  Another theory links it to the Hindi word "chundri," meaning "a woman's garment," perhaps referring to seasickness causing someone to lose their lunch (and possibly more).
