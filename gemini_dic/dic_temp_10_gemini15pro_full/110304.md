Etymology:  From "light-fingered" (adjective) + "-ness" (suffix forming nouns expressing a state or quality).  "Light-fingered" literally describes having nimble fingers, but figuratively means adept at stealing small items. The word "light" in this context refers to the deftness and quickness of the thief's actions, not the weight of the stolen items.
