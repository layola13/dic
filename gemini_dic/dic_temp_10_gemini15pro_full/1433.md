ETYMOLOGY->
Derived from the idiom "ace up one's sleeve," which refers to a hidden playing card that can be used to win a game.  The term "ace" itself comes from the Old French word "as," meaning "one," referring to the lowest value die, which paradoxically became the highest value card in many card games. "Sleeve" refers to the part of a garment covering the arm, where a card could be concealed.
