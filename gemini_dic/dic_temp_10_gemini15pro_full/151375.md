ETYMOLOGY->

The words "parle" (verb) and "parler" (noun) both come from the French verb "parler," which itself descends from the Old French "parler," meaning "to speak."  Ultimately, these words trace back to the Latin "parabolare," meaning "to speak in parables" or "to speak beside," from "para" (beside) and "bolare" (to throw, utter).
