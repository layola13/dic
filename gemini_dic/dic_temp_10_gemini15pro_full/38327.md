词源: From Middle French *conceit* "concept, thought, opinion," borrowed from Latin *conceptus* "a conceiving, thing conceived," past participle of *concipere* "to take in, conceive," from *com-* "together" + *capere* "to take". The sense shifted from "thought, idea" to "favorable opinion of oneself" in the late 16th century.
