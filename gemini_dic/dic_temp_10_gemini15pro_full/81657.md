近义词: nauseous, queasy, pale, sickly
反义词: healthy, well, rosy
词性: adjective

词源: This idiom likely originates from the observation that a person's complexion can appear pale or greenish when they are feeling unwell, particularly seasick.  The "gills" refer to the fleshy flaps that cover the gills of a fish, which can also change color when the fish is unhealthy.  The association with fish likely strengthens the connection to nausea, as fish are often associated with vomiting or a fishy smell.
