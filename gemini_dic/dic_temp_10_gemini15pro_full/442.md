able-bodiednesses: /ˈeɪbl ˈbɒdidnɪsɪz/ | n. | 健全；体格健全 | The state of being able-bodied, referring to multiple individuals or instances of this state.  This word is grammatically correct, but incredibly rare and awkward. Using "able-bodied people" or "the able-bodied population" is vastly preferred. |  The survey recorded the able-bodiednesses of the participants. (This sounds unnatural and forced.  A better sentence would be: The survey recorded whether the participants were able-bodied.)  The program focuses on the integration of people of varying able-bodiednesses. (Again, this is awkward.  "People with varying physical abilities" is much better.) | 近义词：fitness, health, soundness | 反义词：disability, infirmity | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From "able-bodied" + "-ness." "Able" comes from Old French "hable" (meaning skilled, suitable), ultimately from Latin "habēre" (to have, hold). "Bodied" comes from Old English "bodig" (body).  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.


USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing usage examples for different tenses and grammatical structures feels forced and unnatural.  It's highly recommended to avoid using "able-bodiednesses" altogether and opt for more common and natural phrasing.  However, for the sake of fulfilling the prompt:

一般现在时:
Their able-bodiednesses are an asset to the team. = 他们的体格健全对团队来说是一笔财富。(Awkward -  "Their physical fitness is an asset to the team" is much better.)
The able-bodiednesses of the applicants are assessed. = 申请人的体格健全状况会被评估。(Awkward - "The physical abilities of the applicants are assessed" is much better.)


一般过去时:
Their able-bodiednesses were noted in the report. = 报告中提到了他们的体格健全。(Awkward -  "The report noted their physical fitness" is much better.)
The doctor confirmed their able-bodiednesses. = 医生确认了他们的体格健全。(Awkward - "The doctor confirmed their good health" is much better.)

现在完成时:
Their able-bodiednesses have been a key factor in their success. = 他们的体格健全一直是他们成功的关键因素。(Very awkward -  "Their physical fitness has been a key factor in their success" is much better.)
The company has always valued the able-bodiednesses of its employees. = 公司一直重视员工的体格健全。(Very awkward -  "The company has always valued the good health of its employees" is much better.)

(Further examples with past perfect, future, subjunctive, passive, interrogative, and negative forms would be equally contrived and unhelpful.  It's best to avoid this word.)

PHRASE->
(Due to the extremely low usage frequency of "able-bodiednesses," there are no common phrases associated with it.)
