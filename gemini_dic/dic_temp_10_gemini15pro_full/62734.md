注意事项:
Although "englishes" is grammatically incorrect, it could hypothetically be used informally to refer to different varieties or dialects of English (e.g., "American English," "British English," etc.). However, this usage is highly unconventional and not recommended.  It's important to stick to the standard usage of "English."
