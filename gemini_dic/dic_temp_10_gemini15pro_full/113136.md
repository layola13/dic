lunistice: /ˈluːnɪstɪs/ | n. |  月球静止  | A hypothetical moment when the Moon appears to stop its motion relative to the stars, analogous to a solstice or equinox for the Sun. While the term is rarely used in astronomy, it conceptually refers to the points where the Moon reaches its highest or lowest declination. |  The astronomer hypothesized about the effects of a lunistice on tides. 天文学家假设了月球静止对潮汐的影响。|  Near antonyms: lunar standstill | No direct antonyms or synonyms exist. | noun
