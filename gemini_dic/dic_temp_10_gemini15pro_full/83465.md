注意事项:

"Habius" itself is not a common English word.  The correct term is "habeas corpus," a Latin phrase meaning "you shall have the body."  It refers to a legal writ requiring a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, especially to secure the person's release unless lawful grounds are shown for their detention.  By extension, it can refer to a person's possessions or estate, particularly in legal contexts.
