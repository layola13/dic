一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The morula will continue to develop into a blastocyst. = 桑椹胚将继续发育成胚泡。
The morula will implant in the uterine wall. = 桑椹胚将植入子宫壁。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The embryo will be developing into a blastocyst soon. = 胚胎很快就会发育成胚泡。
The cells will be differentiating as the morula develops further. = 随着桑椹胚的进一步发育，细胞将进行分化。
