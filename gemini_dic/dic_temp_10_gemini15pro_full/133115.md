注意事项:
"noneruditions" is grammatically unusual.  While pluralizing "erudition" is acceptable, its negated form, "nonerudition," usually remains singular, referring to a general lack of knowledge rather than distinct instances of it. You would more commonly see phrases like "areas of nonerudition" or "examples of his nonerudition" than the plural form.
