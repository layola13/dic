ETYMOLOGY->
From bland + -ness.  Bland ultimately comes from the Latin blandus, meaning "flattering, charming, alluring."  The semantic shift towards "mild" or "insipid" likely occurred through the sense of something being "smooth" or "soothing," which can sometimes be perceived as lacking character.
