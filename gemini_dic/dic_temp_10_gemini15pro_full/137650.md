Etymology->
"Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "understandable" (adjective from "understand" + "-able" suffix meaning "capable of being").  The word is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to the word "understandable," which itself is derived from the verb "understand" and the suffix "-able."  "Understand" comes from Old English "understandan," meaning "to grasp the meaning of."
