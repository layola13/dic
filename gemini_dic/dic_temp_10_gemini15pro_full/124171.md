Let me provide information about the word "morrow" and "evening," which seem to be the components of this made-up word:

morrow: /ˈmɒroʊ/ (US) /ˈmɒrəʊ/ (UK) | noun | 明天，翌日 | An archaic word meaning "the next day."  |  Good morrow to you, fair sir. (祝你早安，先生 - archaic usage) | Synonyms: tomorrow, next day | Antonyms: yesterday, previous day | Noun

evening: /ˈiːvnɪŋ/ | noun | 晚上，傍晚 | The period of time at the end of the day, usually from about 6 p.m. to bedtime.  | We went for a walk in the evening. (我们晚上去散步了。) | Synonyms: dusk, nightfall, twilight | Antonyms: morning, dawn, daybreak | Noun


Since "morwening" is not a real word, the requested grammatical explanations and examples are not applicable.  It is likely a neologism or a misspelling.
