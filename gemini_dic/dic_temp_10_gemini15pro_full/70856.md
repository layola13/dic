词源：The origin of "fink" is uncertain, but it is likely derived from Yiddish or German slang. One theory suggests it comes from the German word "Finke" (finch), referring to a caged bird that sings, thus metaphorically a person who "sings" to the authorities. Another theory links it to Yiddish "faynk" (coward).
