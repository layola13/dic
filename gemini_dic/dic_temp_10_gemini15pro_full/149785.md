词源: "Palaver" comes from the Portuguese palavra ("word," "speech"), ultimately from Latin parabola ("comparison," "parable"). The suffix "-ments" creates a plural noun, although the word "palaver" itself can function as both singular and plural.  "Palaver" 本身可以作为单数和复数使用。"-ments" 后缀创建一个复数名词，尽管这个词很少使用，通常使用 "palaver" 本身。


由于“palaverments” 很少使用，建议使用 “palaver” 来表达相同的意思。
