词源:  "Offbeat" comes from "off" + "beat."  "Beat" in this context refers to the rhythmic pulse in music.  "Off" signifies deviation or departure.  So, "offbeat" literally means "off the beat,"  referring to unaccented notes in music. This meaning later extended to describe anything unconventional or outside the norm.
