dangest:/ˈdeɪndʒɪst/ | adj. | 最危险的，非常危险的 |  Superlative form of "dange" (dangerous), used informally, especially in some dialects of American English.  It emphasizes the extreme level of danger. | That's the dangest road I've ever driven on. 那是我开过的最危险的道路。 |  He climbed the dangest cliff just to prove he could. 他爬上了最危险的悬崖，就为了证明他能做到。 | 近义词: most dangerous, riskiest, perilous, hazardous | 反义词: safest, securest | 词性: 形容词


词源:  "Dangest" is a non-standard superlative form of "dangerous." It likely arose through dialectal variation in American English, adding the "-est" suffix to "dang," a euphemism for "damn."  While considered informal or dialectal, it effectively conveys a heightened sense of danger.
