注意事项:
"Ain't" is considered non-standard English and should be avoided in formal writing.  It is more common in some dialects and informal spoken English. While it can technically replace several different contractions (isn't, aren't, hasn't, haven't), its usage for anything other than "am not," "is not," "are not," "has not," and "have not" is even less standard and generally discouraged.
