注意事项:

"Hurty" is primarily used in informal contexts, particularly by young children.  Adults generally use more formal terms like "sore," "painful," or "aching."  It's not typically used in formal writing. While a noun form ("hurt") exists, "hurty" functions solely as an adjective.  The etymology is simply derived from "hurt" with the addition of the suffix "-y" to form an adjective.
