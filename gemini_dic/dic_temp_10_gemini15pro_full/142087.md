ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *orienter*  and Latin *oriēns* (present participle of *orīrī* “to rise”),  ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *\h₂ews-ri-* (“dawn”).  Originally referring to the rising sun in the east, the word expanded to encompass directions and then the act of determining direction.
