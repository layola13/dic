PHRASE->
Nall whatsoever = 完全没有
Nall the less = 仍然；尽管如此 (This phrase is uncommon with "nall," but possible in certain dialects.  "None the less" is much more common.)
Nall but =  几乎；差不多 (Again, "none but" is much more common.)
Nall too often = 通常; 常常 (Again, "none too often" is more typical.)
Nall the better for = 并不会因此更好 (This construction is quite rare with "nall." "None the better for" is more standard.)

注意事项:

"Nall" is considered nonstandard or dialectal. While grammatically understandable, using "no," "none," or "not any" is generally preferred in formal and most informal settings.  Its usage is declining and considered archaic in modern English.
