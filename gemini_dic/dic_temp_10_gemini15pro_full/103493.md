词源：jockey (n.) + -ish (suffix)

The word "jockey" comes from the diminutive of the name "Jock," a common Scottish pet form of "John."  The suffix "-ish" is used to form adjectives meaning "having the character of," "somewhat like," or "rather."  Therefore, "jockeyish" literally means "like a jockey."
