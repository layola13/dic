myxopod:/ˈmɪksəpɒd/ | n. | 粘液足生物，粘液足动物 | An organism (typically a protozoan) that moves by means of pseudopodia composed of a clear ectoplasm and a granular endoplasm. |  Amoebae are an example of a myxopod that uses pseudopodia for locomotion and engulfing food. 变形虫是粘液足生物的一个例子，它利用伪足进行移动和吞噬食物。

Myxopods can be found in diverse habitats, including freshwater and soil. 粘液足生物可以在各种各样的栖息地中找到，包括淡水和土壤。 | 近义词: amoeboid, rhizopod | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific mode of locomotion) | 词性: noun
