diamagnetic:/ˌdaɪəˌmæɡˈnɛtɪk/
adjective
抗磁性的
Relating to a substance that is weakly repelled by a magnetic field.  A diamagnetic substance tends to partially expel a magnetic field from its interior.
例句：Bismuth is a diamagnetic metal. 铋是一种抗磁性金属。

例句：Diamagnetic materials create an induced magnetic field in a direction opposite to an externally applied magnetic field, and are therefore repelled by the applied magnetic field. 抗磁性材料会产生与外加磁场方向相反的感应磁场，因此会被外加磁场排斥。
近义词：non-magnetic
反义词：paramagnetic, ferromagnetic
词性: adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From dia- (through, across) + -magnetic.  The prefix "dia-" in this context refers to the magnetic field passing through the material.  The term "magnetic" ultimately derives from the Greek word "magnes" (Μάγνης), referring to a region in Thessaly known for its magnetic lodestones.
