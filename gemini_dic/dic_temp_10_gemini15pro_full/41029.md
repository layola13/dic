Etymology:
From Middle English *copen*, from Old French *couper* (to strike, cut), from Vulgar Latin *colpāre* (to strike), from Latin *colaphus* (a blow, cuff).  The original sense was "to strike or cut," later evolving to "to exchange blows," and finally to the modern sense of "to contend with or overcome difficulties."
