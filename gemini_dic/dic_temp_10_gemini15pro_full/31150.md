The word "chandes" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling of "chance" or perhaps "changes."  I will provide analyses for both:

**Chance:**

/tʃæns/ | n. v. | 机会; 可能性; 偶然事件;  冒险; 碰巧; 冒…的风险 |  There's a chance of rain today. 今天有可能会下雨。| likelihood, probability, possibility | impossibility, unlikelihood | noun, verb

/tʃɑːns/ | n. v. | 机会; 可能性; 偶然事件;  冒险; 碰巧; 冒…的风险 | He chanced upon a rare book in the shop. 他在商店里偶然发现了一本珍本书。| likelihood, probability, possibility | impossibility, unlikelihood | noun, verb
