I'd rather... 我宁愿...
I'd like to... 我想...
I'd better... 我最好...
I'd love to... 我很乐意...
I'd appreciate it if... 如果...我会很感激

注意事项:

"I'm'd" is very informal and generally avoided in formal writing. Its ambiguity can sometimes lead to confusion, so using the full form is often clearer.  It is most commonly encountered in online chat or casual text messages.
