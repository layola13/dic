gynodioecious:/ˌɡaɪnodaɪˈiːʃəs/
adjective
雌雄异株的
Having female flowers on some plants and bisexual flowers on others.
Some plant species are gynodioecious, meaning some plants bear only female flowers while others bear perfect flowers (with both male and female parts).
近义词:  (No exact synonym, but related terms include) dioecious, subdioecious
反义词:  hermaphroditic, monoecious
词性: adjective

Etymology:
From Greek *gyne* (female) + *di-* (two) + *oikos* (house) + *-ous* (adjective ending).  Literally, "two houses for females," referring to the two types of plants within the species: those with only female flowers and those with bisexual (effectively male and female) flowers.
