词源：From French crétin, from Franco-Provençal crestin “Christian,” used euphemistically for “human being, poor fellow.”  The association likely arose from the prevalence of cretinism in Alpine regions, where people were devoutly Christian.  The implication was that even someone with this condition was still a human being deserving of compassion.
