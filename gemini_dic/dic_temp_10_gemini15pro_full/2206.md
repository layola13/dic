ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *adeld*, past participle of *adelen* (“to be or become foul, rot, go bad”), from Old English *ādl* (“disease, sickness, pain”), from Proto-Germanic *ailō* (“pain, misery”). Cognate with Old Saxon *adal* (“sick, ill, bad”), Old Frisian *adl* (“disease”), Old High German *adal* (“sick, ill, bad”), Old Norse *eðla* (“noblewoman”), Gothic *𐌰𐌹𐌻𐍉* (*ailō*). More at ail. The original sense was "afflicted with disease," hence "mentally ill, insane," and later "confused, muddled."
