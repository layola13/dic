PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically form set phrases.  It's an adverb describing *how* something is expressed, rather than forming a unit of meaning with other words.)

Etymology: From Late Latin *genitivus*, from Latin *genitus* "born," past participle of *gignere* "to beget."  The genitive case often indicates origin or possession.
