ETYMOLOGY->
From frontier + -s + man. "Frontier" comes from Old French "frontiere" meaning "borderland," ultimately from Late Latin "fronteria," meaning "forehead" or "front."  The suffix "-s" makes the word plural, but "frontiers" here refers to a general area of frontier. "-man" adds the meaning of a person associated with that area.
