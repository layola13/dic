anodising:/ˈænəˌdaɪzɪŋ/ (UK) /ˈænəˌdaɪzɪŋ/ (US)| n.| 阳极氧化 |The electrochemical process of forming a protective oxide layer on a metal, usually aluminum, to improve its corrosion resistance and other properties.  The process involves immersing the metal in an acid electrolyte bath and passing an electric current through it, making the metal the anode.| The anodising of the aluminum frame gave it a durable and attractive finish.| 近义词: anodization (US)| 反义词: N/A| 词性: noun

anodisation:/ˌænədaɪˈzeɪʃən/ (US)|n.|阳极氧化|The US spelling of anodising, referring to the same electrochemical process.| The anodisation of the airplane parts enhanced their resistance to wear and tear.|近义词: anodising (UK)|反义词: N/A|词性: noun

anodize:/ˈænəˌdaɪz/ (UK) /ˈænəˌdaɪz/ (US)|vt.|阳极氧化（动词）|To coat (a metal, especially aluminum) with a protective oxide layer by an electrolytic process.|  We need to anodize these aluminum components to prevent corrosion.|近义词: N/A|反义词: N/A|词性: verb


Etymology: From anode + -ise/-ize (verb suffix) + -ing (present participle/gerund suffix).  "Anode" ultimately derives from the Greek words "ana" (up) and "hodos" (way), referring to the electrode through which current flows into a polarized electrical device.
