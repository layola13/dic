ETYMOLOGY->
From anti- + realistically.  "Anti-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite of," and "realistically" is derived from "real" + "-istic" + "-ally." "Real" comes from the Latin "realis," meaning "relating to things," and "-istic" forms adjectives meaning "having the character of." Finally, "-ally" is an adverbial suffix.
