词源:
From 'earwig' (n.), from Old English ēarwicga "ear insect," literally "ear wiggler," from ēare "ear" + wicga "insect, worm, beetle."  The notion probably arose from the insect's cerci (rear appendages), which resemble pincers, and a folk belief that earwigs crawled into people's ears.  The verb sense "to eavesdrop" emerged in the 19th century, likely based on the idea of the insect entering the ear to listen. The sense "to influence by whispering" developed later.
