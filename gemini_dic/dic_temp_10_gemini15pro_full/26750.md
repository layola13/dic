caducibranchiate:/kəˌduːsɪˈbræŋkiət/
adjective
蝌蚪状的，具有外鳃的，幼态持续的
Having external gills, relating to or denoting a caducibranch.  A caducibranch is an animal that retains larval characteristics, especially external gills, in the adult stage.
The axolotl is a well-known example of a caducibranchiate animal.  墨西哥钝口螈是蝌蚪状动物的一个著名例子。

The olm is another species that exhibits caducibranchiate characteristics.  洞螈是另一种表现出幼态持续特征的物种。
synonym: neotenous, perennibranchiate
antonym: none (The opposite would imply the loss of gills, a common process in amphibian development, but there isn't a single word specifically for this.)
词性: adjective
