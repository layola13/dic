词源：
"beclap" is a relatively modern word, likely formed by combining the prefix "be-" (meaning "all around," "thoroughly," or "to affect with") with the word "clap."  While not as common as "applaud," it carries a similar meaning of showing approval through clapping.  Its less frequent usage might give it a slightly more emphatic or literary feel in certain contexts.
