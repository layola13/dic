a cozy atmosphere 舒适的氛围
a cozy corner 舒适的角落
a cozy home 舒适的家

注意事项:

"Coziness's" is grammatically unusual. While possessives of nouns ending in -s can be formed with -'s, it often sounds awkward and is generally avoided.  It's better to rephrase to avoid it, e.g., "the coziness of the room" rather than "the room's coziness's."
