ETYMOLOGY->
From Old Norse *kranga (“something crooked”), from Proto-Germanic *krankjaną (“to bend, twist”), from Proto-Indo-European *(s)ker- (“to turn, bend”). Cognate with Danish krange (“crane”), Swedish kran (“crane”), Dutch krang (“crane”), German Kran (“crane”). The connection is likely due to the image of a crane's crooked neck or the bending motion of its lifting mechanism.
