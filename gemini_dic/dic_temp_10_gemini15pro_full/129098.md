注意事项:

* "Nitsa" is a less common variant of "nit", especially in American English. "Nit" is the more widely used term.

*While the requested examples have been provided, sentences about repeatedly checking for nitsa might sound unnatural in everyday conversation. It's more common to say "check for lice/nits" rather than specifying "nitsa" repeatedly.
