hematoxylin:/ˌhiːməˈtɒksɪlɪn/ (US) /ˌhiːməˈtɒksɪlɪn/ (UK)| n.|苏木精|A dark purple dye extracted from the heartwood of the logwood tree, used especially in microscopy to stain cell nuclei.  It is a basic dye and stains acidic components of the cell (such as DNA) blue-violet.|The pathologist used hematoxylin and eosin stain to examine the tissue sample.|Synonyms:  logwood extract, natural dye|Antonyms: eosin (often used in counterstaining)|noun
