kiloton:/ˈkɪlətʌn/ | n. | 千吨 | A unit of explosive power equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT. | The bomb had a yield of several kilotons.  这枚炸弹的当量为几千吨。| synonyms: megaton | antonyms: (No direct antonym for a unit of measurement) | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From kilo- + ton.  Kilo- is a combining form representing "thousand," from Greek khilioi "thousand." Ton comes from Old English tunne "a large cask," later denoting a unit of weight.
