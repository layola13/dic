词源:
Originating in the American South in the 19th century, "ornery" is likely a variant of "ordinary" influenced by "onery" (meaning "inferior" or "worthless").  The shift in meaning from "ordinary" to "bad-tempered" is thought to have occurred through a process of semantic pejoration, where a word takes on a more negative connotation over time.
