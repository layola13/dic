ETYMOLOGY->
From average + -able.  "Average" comes from Old French "avarie," meaning "damage to ship or cargo," which in turn comes from Italian "avaria."  The meaning shifted from "damage" to "financial loss shared by multiple parties," and eventually to the mathematical sense of a mean value. "-able" is a suffix indicating capability or worthiness.
