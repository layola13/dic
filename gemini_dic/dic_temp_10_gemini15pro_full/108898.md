ETYMOLOGY->
"Led-out" comes from the verb "to lead out," which in this context likely evolved from the sense of leading someone or something to exhaustion. Imagine leading a horse or other animal to the point where it is completely spent. This physical sense of exhaustion then broadened to include general fatigue and, in some informal contexts, the idea of something being worn out or outdated, like a fashion trend that has run its course.
