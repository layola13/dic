bipinnaria:/ˌbaɪpɪˈnɛəriə/| n. |双羽幼虫|The larval form of certain starfish, characterized by bilateral symmetry and two ciliated bands used for swimming and feeding.  It is a free-swimming planktonic stage.|The bipinnaria larva is a crucial stage in the starfish life cycle. 双羽幼虫是海星生命周期中的一个关键阶段。

The bipinnaria swims freely in the ocean currents. 双羽幼虫在洋流中自由游动。|近义词:larva 幼虫|反义词:adult 成体|词性:noun 名词

Etymology: From bi- (two) + pinnate (feather-like) + -aria (a suffix forming nouns).  The name refers to the two ciliated bands that resemble feathers. 源于bi-（两个）+ pinnate（羽毛状的）+ -aria（构成名词的后缀）。这个名称指的是类似羽毛的两条纤毛带。
