baculometry: /ˌbækjuˈlɒmətri/ | n. |杆状病毒测定法|The estimation of the concentration of a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) preparation, usually expressed as the number of polyhedra per unit volume.  It is a method used to quantify baculoviruses, which are rod-shaped viruses often used as biopesticides or in gene expression systems. | Baculometry is essential for accurate dosing in pest control. 杆状病毒测定法对于虫害控制中的精确剂量至关重要。| Synonym:  bioassay (for broader context), virus quantification | Antonym: N/A | noun
