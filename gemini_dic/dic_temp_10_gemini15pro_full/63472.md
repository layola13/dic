entropies:/ˈɛntrəpiz/| n. |熵（复数）|A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.  The plural form of "entropy".|The entropies of the systems are increasing.  这些系统的熵正在增加。|近义词：randomness, disorder, chaos|反义词：order, organization|词性:名词

词源: From Ancient Greek ἐντροπία (entropía, “a turning towards, transformation”), from ἐν (en, “in”) + τροπή (tropḗ, “a turning, change”). Coined in 1862 by Rudolf Clausius.
