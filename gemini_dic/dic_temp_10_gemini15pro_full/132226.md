词源：
non- (prefix): not
deceit (noun): the action or practice of deceiving someone by concealing or misrepresenting the truth.

The word "nondeceit" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" meaning "not" with the noun "deceit."  Therefore, it literally means "not deceit."  It's a relatively uncommon word, with "honesty" and "truthfulness" being more frequently used synonyms.
