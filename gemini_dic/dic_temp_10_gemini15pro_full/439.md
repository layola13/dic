ETYMOLOGY->
From 'able' + '-s' (plural suffix).  'Able' originates from Old French 'hable,' ultimately from Latin 'habilis' meaning "easily handled, apt."

USAGE->
This word is not commonly used in modern English and doesn't fit neatly into standard grammatical constructions.  It's more likely to be found in older texts or dialectal speech.  Therefore, providing examples for various tenses and grammatical structures feels forced and unnatural.  Using "abilities" or a similar synonym is generally preferred.

PHRASE->
Due to its infrequent usage, "able's" doesn't have common set phrases associated with it.  It's more likely to be found in informal expressions like "showing one's able's," similar to "showing one's skills."
