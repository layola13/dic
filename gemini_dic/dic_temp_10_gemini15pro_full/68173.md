词源:
From faint-hearted + -ness.  "Faint-hearted" itself comes from "faint" (weak, lacking strength) + "hearted" (having a heart of a certain kind).  The word "faint" ultimately traces back to the Old French "feint," past participle of "feindre" meaning "to feign" or "pretend," suggesting an initial connection to feigning weakness.  Over time, the meaning shifted to genuine weakness, especially of the heart and thus of spirit.
