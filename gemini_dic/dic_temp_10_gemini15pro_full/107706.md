lantanuric:/ˌlæntəˈnjʊərɪk/
adjective
镧尿的
Relating to or containing lanthanum in the urine.  Specifically, referring to the presence of lanthanum in the urine, typically after administration of lanthanum carbonate for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels in the blood).
Lanthanum carbonate is prescribed to reduce phosphate absorption in the gut, and some lanthanum is subsequently excreted in the urine.  However, the term "lantanuric" isn't commonly used in medical literature.  More precise terms like "urinary lanthanum excretion" are preferred.
No common example sentences found due to infrequent usage.  An example sentence using related terminology could be:  "Urinary lanthanum excretion was measured after administration of lanthanum carbonate." 尿液中镧的排泄量在服用碳酸镧后被测量。
