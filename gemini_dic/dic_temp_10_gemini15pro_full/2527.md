ETYMOLOGY->
From admirable + -ness.  Admirable comes from Late Middle English: from late Latin admirabilis, from admirari ‘to wonder at’.

USAGE->
The noun "admirableness" is not commonly used in modern English.  While grammatically correct, it sounds formal and somewhat archaic.  More natural and common ways to express the same idea would be using adjectives like "admirable," "praiseworthy," or "commendable," or nouns like "admiration," "excellence," or "merit."  Therefore, providing usage examples in various tenses isn't as helpful as illustrating how to express the concept in more contemporary language.

Contemporary Alternatives:

Expressing the quality of being admirable:

His dedication to his work is admirable. = 他对工作的奉献精神令人钦佩。
Her courage in the face of adversity was truly commendable. = 她面对逆境的勇气确实值得称赞。
The project demonstrated the team's excellence. = 这个项目展示了团队的卓越能力。

Expressing the feeling of admiration:

I have great admiration for her achievements. = 我非常钦佩她的成就。
His bravery inspired admiration in everyone. = 他的勇敢鼓舞了所有人钦佩他。

PHRASE->
Due to the infrequent use of "admirableness," it doesn't typically appear in set phrases.  Instead, consider phrases related to the more common synonyms:

of great merit = 非常有价值
a person of admirable qualities = 具有令人钦佩品质的人
worthy of admiration = 值得钦佩
deserving of praise = 值得称赞
a display of excellence = 卓越的表现


注意事项:

While "admirableness" is a valid word, using more common synonyms will generally result in clearer and more natural-sounding English.
