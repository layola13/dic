Etymology:
From *impractical* + *-ity*. *Impractical* is from *in-* (not) + *practical*. *Practical* ultimately comes from the Late Latin *prācticālis*, from Latin *prācticē* (in practice), from Greek *πρακτικός* (*praktikos*, “fit for action”), from *πράσσω* (*prassō*, “I do, I achieve”).  The suffix *-ity* is used to form nouns denoting a state or quality.
