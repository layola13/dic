endoblastic:/ˌɛndəˈblæstɪk/| adj.|内胚层的，由内胚层形成的|Relating to or derived from the endoblast, the inner layer of cells in an early embryo that gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract and other internal organs.|The endoblastic layer forms the gut. 内胚层形成肠道。|The lungs develop from an endoblastic outgrowth. 肺由内胚层突出物发育而来。|近义词：entoblastic, hypoblastic|反义词: ectoblastic, mesoblastic|词性:adjective


词源: From endo- + -blastic.  "Endo-" comes from Greek "endon" meaning "within," and "-blastic" comes from Greek "blastos"  meaning "germ" or "bud."
