multisets:/ˈmʌltiˌsɛts/| n. |多重集|A multiset (sometimes called a bag) is a generalization of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows multiple instances of the multiset's elements. The multiplicity of an element is the number of instances of the element in a specific multiset.|The multiset {a, a, b} contains two instances of a and one instance of b. |Synonyms: bag|Antonyms: set|Noun
