nonclassicalities:/ˌnɑːnklæsɪˈkælɪtiz/ | n. | 非经典性 |  Behaviors or properties of a system that deviate from the predictions of classical physics, often related to quantum mechanics.  These deviations typically involve phenomena like entanglement, superposition, and quantum interference. | The experiment revealed several nonclassicalities, such as strong correlations between the photons.  实验揭示了几种非经典性，例如光子之间的强相关性。

The researchers are exploring the nonclassicalities of light in quantum optical systems. 研究人员正在探索量子光学系统中光的非经典性。 | synonyms: quantum phenomena, quantum effects, quantum behaviors | antonyms: classical phenomena, classical behaviors | noun
