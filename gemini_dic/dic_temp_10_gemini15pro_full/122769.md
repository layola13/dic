注意事项:
MuJoCo is typically pronounced with the stress on the second syllable: /ˈmoʊdʒoʊkoʊ/.
While "mojo" itself can have a more figurative meaning related to magic or charisma, in the context of "MuJoCo," it refers specifically to the physics engine. The origin of the name is not widely documented but is believed to be connected to its creator, Emo Todorov.
