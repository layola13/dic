The word "deipa" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term within a specific field, or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis for it.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.  For example, is it a name, an acronym, or part of a larger phrase?

However, as per your request, I can demonstrate the format you've provided with a common English word: **axiom**.

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理; 定理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. |  Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应与恐怖分子谈判，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。 | Example:  One of the key axioms of the theory is that all matter is made up of tiny particles.  该理论的一个关键公理是所有物质都是由微小粒子组成的。 | Synonym:  principle, theorem, law, postulate | Antonym:  paradox, absurdity | Noun
