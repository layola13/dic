aerofoils:/ˈɛərəfɔɪlz/ | n. | 机翼，翼型 | A shaped surface, such as a wing, propeller blade, or rudder, designed to obtain reaction upon the air through which it moves. | The aerofoils of the plane were iced up. 这架飞机的机翼结冰了。| synonyms: wing, airfoil section, hydrofoil, aileron, blade | antonyms: N/A | noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From aero- + -foil.  "Aero-" comes from Greek "aēr" meaning "air". "-foil" ultimately comes from Latin "folium" meaning "leaf".

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The aerofoil generates lift as air flows over it. = 机翼在气流流过时产生升力。
The shape of the aerofoil is crucial for its performance. = 翼型的形状对其性能至关重要。

一般过去时:
The engineers designed the aerofoil to minimize drag. = 工程师们设计了这个翼型以最大程度地减少阻力。
The pilot adjusted the aerofoils to control the aircraft's descent. = 飞行员调整机翼来控制飞机的下降。

现在完成时:
Researchers have developed new aerofoil designs for improved efficiency. = 研究人员开发了新的翼型设计以提高效率。
The aircraft manufacturer has tested the aerofoils extensively in wind tunnels. = 飞机制造商在风洞中对机翼进行了广泛的测试。

过去完成时:
The Wright brothers had experimented with different aerofoil shapes before their first successful flight. = 莱特兄弟在第一次成功飞行之前就尝试了不同的翼型形状。
Scientists had studied bird wings to understand the principles of aerofoil design. = 科学家们研究了鸟类的翅膀以了解翼型设计的原理。

将来时:
Future aircraft will likely incorporate advanced aerofoil technologies. = 未来的飞机可能会采用先进的翼型技术。
Engineers will continue to refine aerofoil designs to optimize performance. = 工程师将继续改进翼型设计以优化性能。


被动语态:
The aerofoils were carefully inspected for damage. = 机翼经过仔细检查，以防损坏。
New aerofoils are being developed for use in wind turbines. = 新的翼型正在开发中，用于风力涡轮机。

疑问句:
What type of aerofoil is used on this aircraft? = 这架飞机使用的是哪种翼型？
How do the aerofoils generate lift? = 机翼是如何产生升力的？

否定句:
The aerofoils were not damaged during the flight. = 飞行过程中机翼没有损坏。
The aircraft does not have conventional aerofoils. = 这架飞机没有传统的机翼。

PHRASE->
aerofoil section = 翼型剖面
aerofoil design = 翼型设计
aerofoil shape = 翼型形状
aerofoil theory = 翼型理论
aircraft aerofoils = 飞机机翼
