ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *machen, borrowed from Old French macher (“to crush, chew, bruise”),  from Late Latin *masticare, from Latin masticāre (“to chew”), from Ancient Greek μαστιχάω (mastikháō, “to gnash the teeth”) and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mendʰ- (“to chew, bite”).  The sense of "to be equal or similar to" developed from the idea of two things fitting together like the jaws in chewing.
