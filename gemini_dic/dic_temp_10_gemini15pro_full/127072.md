词源: From Latin *natatorius (“swimming, of or pertaining to a swimmer”), from natator (“swimmer”), from nato (“I swim”).  While seemingly related to swimming, the word has evolved to its current meaning, likely through a misunderstanding or misapplication over time. The original meaning is now obsolete.
