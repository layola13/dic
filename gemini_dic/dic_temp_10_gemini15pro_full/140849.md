ETYMOLOGY->
"Dole" originally meant a portion or share of something distributed.  It comes from Old English *dāl (meaning "portion"), which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *dailiz (meaning "part, share").  The specific meaning of "unemployment benefit" emerged in the 20th century, likely influenced by the practice of distributing charitable doles of food or money.
