词源：
From Old French *brandiss-, present participle stem of brandir "to brandish," from Frankish *brand "sword," from Proto-Germanic *brando- "something burning, a torch, a sword," from PIE root *gwhrendh- "to rub, grind."  The original sense was "to move a sword rapidly," hence "to wave menacingly." The meaning "to display ostentatiously" dates from the 1560s.
