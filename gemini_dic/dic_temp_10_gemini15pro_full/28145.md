Etymology: From Late Latin *capitulatus, past participle of capitulare “to draw up in chapters, arrange conditions, surrender on terms,” from Latin capitulum “little head,” diminutive of caput “head.”  The sense development likely arose from the idea of drawing up articles of agreement, like chapters in a book, when surrendering.
