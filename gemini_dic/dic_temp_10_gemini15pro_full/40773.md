词源:
From convincible + -ities.  Convincible itself comes from the Late Latin *convincibilis, from convincere "to convince," from com- "together" + vincere "to conquer."

用法说明:
Convincibilities is a plural noun referring to the various aspects or instances of being convincible. It's a less common word than "convincibility" (the singular form).  It can be used to discuss the general persuadability of a person or group, or the persuasiveness of specific arguments or pieces of evidence.
