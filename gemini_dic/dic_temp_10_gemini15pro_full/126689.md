注意事项:

"Name's" is very informal and generally only used in spoken English.  It's less common in written English, except perhaps in very informal dialogue.  While grammatically correct in most tenses, it often sounds more natural to use the full "name is" in many of the examples above, especially in formal contexts.  Using "name's" in complex tenses like the perfect continuous tenses is generally avoided.
