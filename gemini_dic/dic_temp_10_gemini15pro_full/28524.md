注意事项:

"Cardier" isn't a standard English word. It seems to be a comparative form derived from "cardi" which also isn't a recognized English word. While the structure resembles valid comparative adjectives (e.g., "easier," "happier"), without a base word "cardi,"  "cardier" lacks proper etymological grounding.  This analysis assumes the intended meaning is "more important" or "more crucial" and provides information based on this interpretation.  If a different meaning was intended, please clarify.
