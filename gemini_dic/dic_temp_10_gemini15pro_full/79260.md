注意事项:

The term "Sandemanian" is often used interchangeably with "Glassite," particularly in later periods after Robert Sandeman became a prominent leader. However, while closely related, there are some subtle theological differences between the two groups.  "Sandemanian"一词经常与"Glassite"互换使用，尤其是在罗伯特·桑德曼成为杰出领袖之后的后期。然而，虽然密切相关，但两组之间存在一些微妙的神学差异。
