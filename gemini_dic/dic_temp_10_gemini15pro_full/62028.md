enatation:  This word does not appear to be a valid English word. It is likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

Did you perhaps mean "annotation" or "natation" (swimming)?  I can provide analyses for those words if you would like.
