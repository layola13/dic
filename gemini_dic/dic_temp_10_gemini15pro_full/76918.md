Etymology:
From Middle High German *ganz, from Old High German ganz "whole, healthy, complete," from Proto-Germanic *gailnaz "whole," from Proto-Indo-European *gʰóih₁los "whole, healthy, sound."  Cognate with English *yall (obsolete), Old Norse heill "healthy," Gothic hails "sound, whole."  The meaning shifted from "healthy, sound" to "whole, complete" and then to "quite, very" as an intensifier.
