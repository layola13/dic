bit-streams:/ˈbɪtˌstriːmz/| n.|比特流|A continuous sequence of bits, typically representing data or instructions in digital form. It is the raw format of digital information as it's transmitted or stored.  Imagine a stream of 0s and 1s flowing through a wire or stored on a hard drive - that's a bit-stream.|The file was corrupted, resulting in a garbled bit-stream.|Synonyms: binary stream, bit flow|Antonyms: analog signal|noun
