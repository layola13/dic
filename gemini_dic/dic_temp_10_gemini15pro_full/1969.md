ETYMOLOGY->
From the verb "activate," which comes from Late Latin "activatus," the past participle of "activare," meaning "to make active."  This is derived from Latin "actus," meaning "act" or "deed," ultimately from the verb "agere," meaning "to do" or "to drive." The "-or" suffix denotes an agent or something that performs the action.

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Activators play a crucial role in many biological processes. = 激活剂在许多生物过程中起着至关重要的作用。
These activators increase the rate of reaction. = 这些激活剂提高了反应速率。


一般过去时:
The scientists discovered that certain chemicals acted as activators. = 科学家们发现某些化学物质充当了活化剂。
The added activators initiated the fermentation process. = 添加的活化剂启动了发酵过程。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several new activators for this enzyme. = 研究人员已经确定了这种酶的几种新的激活剂。
The company has developed powerful activators for their cleaning products. = 该公司已经为其清洁产品开发了强大的活化剂。


过去完成时:
The reaction had already begun before the activators were added. = 在添加激活剂之前，反应已经开始了。
Scientists had studied these activators for years before understanding their mechanism. = 科学家们研究这些活化剂多年后才了解它们的机制。


将来时:
New activators will be essential for developing more efficient catalysts. = 新的活化剂对于开发更高效的催化剂至关重要。

被动语态:
The enzyme is activated by specific molecules. = 这种酶被特定分子激活。
The activators were added to the solution carefully. = 活化剂被小心地添加到溶液中。


疑问句:
What are the most effective activators for this particular reaction? = 对于这个特定的反应，哪些是最有效的活化剂？
How do these activators work at the molecular level? = 这些活化剂如何在分子水平上起作用？


否定句:
These chemicals are not activators, but rather inhibitors. = 这些化学物质不是激活剂，而是抑制剂。
The reaction did not proceed because the necessary activators were absent. = 反应没有进行，因为缺少必要的活化剂。
