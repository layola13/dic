eddington:/ˈedɪŋtən/ | n. | 爱丁顿 |  Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882-1944) was a British astronomer and physicist known for his work on the theory of relativity and the structure of stars.  He is also known for leading an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 1919 which provided experimental confirmation of Einstein's theory of general relativity. |  Eddington's work revolutionized our understanding of the universe. 爱丁顿的研究彻底改变了我们对宇宙的理解。| synonyms: none (as it's a proper noun) | antonyms: none (as it's a proper noun) | proper noun
