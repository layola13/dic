词源:  From the verb "besot," meaning to make someone infatuated or foolishly in love, from "be-" (making) and "sot" (a habitual drunkard).  The "-ed" creates the past participle used as an adjective (besotted), then "-ness" forms the noun (besottedness). Finally, the "-'s" is the possessive form of the noun, indicating belonging or origin.
