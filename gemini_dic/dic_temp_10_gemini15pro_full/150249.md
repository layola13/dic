Etymology: From the verb "pander" + "-ous." "Pander" comes from the character Pandarus in Chaucer's *Troilus and Criseyde* and Shakespeare's *Troilus and Cressida*, who acts as a go-between for the lovers. The character's name ultimately derives from Pandaros, a character in Greek mythology.  The original meaning of "pander" was "to act as a go-between in a love affair," which later broadened to "cater to the base desires of others."  The adjective "panderous" then developed to describe language or style that is excessively elaborate or ornamented, often in a way that seems insincere or designed to manipulate.
