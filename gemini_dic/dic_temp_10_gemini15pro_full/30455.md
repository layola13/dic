From Old French *centre*, from Latin centrum “center,” from Greek kentron “sharp point, stationary point of a pair of compasses, center of a circle,” originally neuter of kentrōsis “act of pricking.”  The spelling with -re was restored in the 19th century in Britain to conform to the French spelling.
