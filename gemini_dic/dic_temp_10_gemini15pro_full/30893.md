ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ċeaf (attested only in compounds like *ċeaf-hēap "heap of chaff"), from Proto-Germanic *kafō (source also of Old High German cheva, German Kaff), from Proto-Indo-European *gōbh- "to comb, scratch".  The verb sense of "to tease" developed later, likely from the light and airy nature of chaff.
