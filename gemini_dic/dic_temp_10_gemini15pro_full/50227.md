hang from:  悬挂于...
be suspended from:  悬挂于...
rely on:  依赖于...
depend on:  依赖于...

注意事项:

"depend from" is archaic and should be avoided in modern English.  Use "hang from," "be suspended from," or "depend on/rely on" instead.  Its literal meaning relates to physically hanging from something, while its figurative meaning (relying on) is better expressed with "depend on" or "rely on."
