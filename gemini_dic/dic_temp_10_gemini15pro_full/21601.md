词源:  "Blunderful" is a blend of "blunder" and "-ful." "Blunder" comes from the Old Norse "blundra" meaning "to shut one's eyes."  "Blunderful" is not a standard English word and is considered informal or humorous.  它是由“blunder”（错误）和后缀“-ful”组合而成的。“blunder”源于古诺尔斯语“blundra”，意为“闭上眼睛”。 “Blunderful”不是标准英语词汇，被认为是非正式或幽默的用法。
