词源:  "Cokiest" is the superlative form of "coky," which means arrogant or conceited.  While the original meaning relates to arrogance, "coky" and especially "cokiest" have evolved in some dialects to describe someone who is exceptionally funny or tells the best jokes. This shift likely arises from the confidence and boldness often associated with humor.  "Coky" itself likely originates from "cock" (as in a rooster), referencing the bird's strutting and self-assured demeanor.
