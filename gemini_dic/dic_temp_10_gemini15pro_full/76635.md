ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *gealla (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *gallō, from Proto-Indo-European *gelh₂- (“yellow, green, gall”). Cognate with Old Norse gall (“gall, bile”), Old High German galla (“gall”), Latin fel (“gall, bile”).  The sense of "bitterness" developed from the bitter taste of bile, and the sense of "impudence" likely arose from the association of bile with anger and irascibility.
