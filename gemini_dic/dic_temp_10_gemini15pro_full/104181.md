ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *joncate*, from Old French *joncade*, from Late Latin *iuncata* "cream cheese, rush basket," from Latin *iuncus* "rush," referring to the rush mats on which cheese was originally drained. The sense of "pleasure trip" arose in the 19th century, perhaps from the association of such trips with feasting and luxury.
