desublimating: /ˌdiːsəˈblɪmeɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 升华，凝华 |  The process of a substance changing from a gas directly to a solid without passing through the liquid state.  This is the opposite of sublimation. | The desublimating vapors formed ice crystals on the cold surface.  凝华蒸气在冷表面形成了冰晶。|  condensing, depositing | sublimating | verb

Etymology: de- (prefix meaning "reverse" or "remove") + sublimate (from Latin sublimatus, past participle of sublimare "to raise, elevate," from sub "up to" + limen "threshold").  The "de-" prefix reverses the process of sublimation.
