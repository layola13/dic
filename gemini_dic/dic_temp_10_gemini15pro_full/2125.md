ETYMOLOGY->
From adaptedness + -'s (possessive suffix).
Adaptedness comes from adapt + -ed (suffix forming adjectives) + -ness (suffix forming nouns).
Adapt comes from Latin adaptare "to fit, adjust," from ad- "to" + aptare "to fit."

USAGE->
The possessive form "adaptedness's" is generally considered awkward and less common than using "of" to express possession.  It's more typical to see phrases like "the adaptedness of the camel" rather than "the camel's adaptedness's."  However, it is grammatically correct, especially when referring to a specific quality of adaptedness.

Here are some examples demonstrating its potential usage in different contexts:
