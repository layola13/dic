methylic:/mɪˈθɪlɪk/ | adj. | 甲基的，甲醇的 | Relating to or derived from methyl alcohol (methanol). | Methyl salicylate is a common ingredient in liniments. 水杨酸甲酯是搽剂中的常见成分。|  The methylic reaction produced the desired compound. 甲基化反应产生了所需的化合物。 | 近义词: methyl | 反义词: N/A | 词性: adjective

词源: From methyl + -ic.  "Methyl" comes from Greek "methy" (wine) + "hyle" (wood), as methanol was originally produced by the destructive distillation of wood. The suffix "-ic" forms adjectives meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."
