nonvariance:/ˌnɒnˈveəriəns/ | n. |不变性，非方差|The principle of nonvariance states that certain properties of a system remain unchanged under certain transformations.|  In some programming languages, nonvariance ensures type safety by preventing substitutions of subtypes where invariance is expected. |近义词：invariance, constancy, stability|反义词：variance, variability, fluctuation|词性:名词

Etymology:
From non- + variance.  "Variance" comes from the Late Latin "variantia," meaning "difference" or "change."  "Non-" is a prefix indicating negation or absence.
