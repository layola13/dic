词源:  "Evolatical" appears to be a relatively recent coinage, likely derived from "evolution" and the suffix "-ical," which means "relating to" or "characterized by." While not yet a widely established dictionary word, its formation is understandable, suggesting a connection to processes of change and development, particularly those that are rapid or unpredictable.
