注意事项:
The word "it'll" is informal and generally used in spoken language or casual writing.  In formal writing, it's better to use "it will."


词源： "it'll" is a contraction of "it will" or "it shall."  "Will" comes from Old English *willan, meaning "to wish, desire, want."  "Shall" comes from Old English sceal, meaning "owe, ought to, must."  Over time, "shall" has become less common, and "will" is now the more common auxiliary verb used to form the future tense, even with the pronoun "I" and "we."
