ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *besechen*, from Old English *besēcan* (“to seek, beseech, implore, beg, ask, require, demand”), from Proto-Germanic *bisōkjōną* (“to seek out, visit, beseech”).  Cognate with Dutch *bezoeken* (“to visit”), German *besuchen* (“to visit”), Swedish *besöka* (“to visit”).  The original sense of "visit" was lost in English, but is retained in the other Germanic languages.
