注意事项:

"Forewish" is not a common word.  While grammatically correct, native speakers are much more likely to use synonyms like "predict," "anticipate," or "foresee."  The examples using continuous tenses with "forewish" sound particularly unnatural.  In most cases, a different word choice would be more appropriate.
