词源:  "High-def" is a shortened form of "high definition," which itself describes an image or video system with significantly more detail and clarity than standard definition. "Definition" in this context refers to the clarity and sharpness of an image, deriving from the Latin "definire" (to define, limit, or determine). The prefix "high-" simply denotes a greater level of this definition.
