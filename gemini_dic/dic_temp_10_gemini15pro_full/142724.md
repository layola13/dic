otoconite:/ˈoʊtəˌkoʊnaɪt/ | n. | 耳石 | A small crystalline particle of calcium carbonate found in the inner ear, specifically in the utricle and saccule of the vestibular system. These crystals are essential for balance and spatial orientation. | The otoconites shift with gravity and acceleration, stimulating hair cells that send signals to the brain about the body's position and movement. | 近义词: otolith | 反义词:  (No direct antonym) | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From Greek *ōto- 'ear' + *konia 'dust' + *-ite 'mineral'.
