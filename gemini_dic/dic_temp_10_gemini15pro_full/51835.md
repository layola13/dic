"dewret" is not a recognized English word.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a technical term specific to a very niche field, a newly coined word, or simply not a word at all.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis for it.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, if it's a misspelling, knowing the intended meaning would help me suggest the correct word.
