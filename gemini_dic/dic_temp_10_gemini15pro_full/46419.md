注意事项:  Since "dage" is mostly used in informal online settings, particularly within the Scandinavian gaming community, its usage within formal English contexts is highly uncommon.  It's crucial to understand its informal and niche nature to use it appropriately.  Attempting to use it in formal writing or with individuals unfamiliar with gaming slang might lead to confusion or misinterpretation.
