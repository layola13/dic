词源:  Borrowed from Japanese はさし (hasashi, “scissors”), from  挟 (hasa(mu), “to pinch, to hold between”) + -し (-shi, nominalizing suffix). Originally referred to scissors or tongs used for handling hot objects. The semantic shift likely occurred due to the association of dryness and roughness with heat and the tools used to handle it.
