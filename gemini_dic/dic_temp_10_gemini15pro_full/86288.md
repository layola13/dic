ETYMOLOGY->
From "heavy hand" (literal meaning: a hand that is weighty), figuratively extended to describe actions or behavior lacking delicacy and subtlety. "Heavy" emphasizes the excessive or forceful nature, while "hand" represents the action or influence itself.  The "-ed" suffix transforms it into an adjective, and the "-ness" suffix creates the noun form referring to the quality or state. The plural form "heavy-handednesses" refers to multiple instances of this behavior.
