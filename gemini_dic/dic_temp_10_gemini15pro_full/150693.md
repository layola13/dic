Etymology: para- + sailing.  "Para-" is a combining form meaning "alongside" or "resembling."  It's ultimately derived from the Greek preposition "para," meaning "beside," "along," "beyond."  "Sailing" refers to the act of traveling in a boat propelled by sails or the wind.  Together, they describe the activity of being pulled along by a boat while suspended from a parachute-like canopy.
