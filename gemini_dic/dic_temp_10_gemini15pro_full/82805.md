注意事项:
Since "guis" is a plural noun, it doesn't have verb forms or adjectival uses.  It's specifically related to computer interfaces, so the examples and explanations focus on that context.  There are no true antonyms for a plural noun like "guis," but command-line interfaces represent a contrasting approach to user interaction.
