词源:
"Non-" is a prefix meaning "not". "Gassier" is the comparative form of "gaseous", meaning "having the form or nature of gas".  Therefore, "nongassier" means "not producing or generating gas". "Gaseous" ultimately derives from "gas", which has uncertain origins, possibly coined by the Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont, inspired by the Greek word "chaos".
