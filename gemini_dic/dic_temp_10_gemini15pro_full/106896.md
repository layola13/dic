The land above the laccolith is slowly uplifting. 岩盖上方的土地正在缓慢抬升。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect):
The laccolith has caused significant deformation of the surrounding rocks.  岩盖已经引起了周围岩石的显著变形。
Erosion has exposed the laccolith. 侵蚀作用暴露出了岩盖。


现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
Magma has been intruding and forming this laccolith for thousands of years.  岩浆侵入并形成了这个岩盖已经数千年了。
Scientists have been studying this laccolith to understand its formation. 科学家们一直在研究这个岩盖以了解它的形成过程。


一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The laccolith formed millions of years ago. 岩盖形成于数百万年前。
The intrusion of the magma created the laccolith. 岩浆的侵入形成了岩盖。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The ground was uplifting as the laccolith formed. 岩盖形成时，地面正在抬升。
Magma was intruding between the rock layers. 岩浆正在侵入岩层之间。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before erosion occurred, the laccolith had been completely buried. 在侵蚀发生之前，岩盖已经被完全掩埋。
The magma had already solidified before the uplift began. 在抬升开始之前，岩浆已经凝固了。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
Magma had been intruding for a long time before the laccolith became visible. 岩浆侵入很长时间后，岩盖才变得可见。
The earth's crust had been under pressure before the laccolith formed. 在岩盖形成之前，地壳一直处于压力之下。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
Erosion will eventually expose more of the laccolith. 侵蚀最终会暴露更多的岩盖。
Geologists will study the laccolith to learn more about its composition. 地质学家将研究岩盖以了解更多关于其成分的信息。


将来进行时 (Future Continuous):

The area around the laccolith will be monitored for changes. 岩盖周围的区域将被监测以发现变化。


将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the century, erosion will have exposed the entire laccolith. 到本世纪末，侵蚀将暴露整个岩盖。
Scientists will have gathered more data on the laccolith's formation. 科学家将收集更多关于岩盖形成的数据。


将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next year, geologists will have been studying this laccolith for five years. 到明年，地质学家将已经研究这个岩盖五年了。
