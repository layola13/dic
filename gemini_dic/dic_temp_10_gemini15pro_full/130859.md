PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Nonarbitrarily" is typically used on its own and does not form common phrases.


词源:
From "non-" (not) + "arbitrary" (based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system). "Arbitrary" comes from the Latin "arbitrarius," meaning "depending on the will of an arbiter."
