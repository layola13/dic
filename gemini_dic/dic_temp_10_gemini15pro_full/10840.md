ETYMOLOGY->
From arabber + -'s (possessive suffix).  "Arabber" itself likely originated in the US in the 19th century, possibly influenced by the word "Arab" due to the perceived exoticism of street vending, though there is no direct etymological connection to the Arab world.  It primarily referred to street vendors, often African American, selling produce from horse-drawn carts in urban areas, particularly Baltimore.
