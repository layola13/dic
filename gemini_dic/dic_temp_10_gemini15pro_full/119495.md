microperthite:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈpɜːrθaɪt/
n.
微斜长石
A feldspar mineral consisting of two intergrown components, albite (sodium feldspar) and orthoclase (potassium feldspar), where the albite forms microscopic lamellae within the orthoclase.
Microperthite is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks. 微斜长石是许多火成岩和变质岩的常见成分。
Microperthite is often found in granites. 微斜长石经常在花岗岩中发现。
Synonym: perthite, alkali feldspar
Antonym: (No direct antonym, but could contrast with plagioclase feldspar which is calcium-sodium feldspar)
