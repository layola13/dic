ETYMOLOGY->
From French *adroitement*, from *adroit* (meaning "skillful") + *-ment* (adverbial suffix). *Adroit* itself comes from Old French *adroit*, meaning "right, proper," from *à droit* "according to right," ultimately from Latin *directus* "straight, direct."  The semantic shift from "right, proper" to "skillful" likely occurred because doing something "right" implies a certain level of skill.
