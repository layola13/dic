PHRASE-> (Not applicable as "et" is archaic and not used in modern phrases)


注意事项:  The word "et" is archaic and rarely, if ever, used in modern English.  It is essentially synonymous with "and" but its use would be considered extremely unusual and out of place.  Therefore, all example sentences using "et" in modern grammatical constructions are marked as archaic.  It's important to learn and use "and" instead.
