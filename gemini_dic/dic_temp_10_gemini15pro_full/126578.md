ETYMOLOGY->
From *naff* (British slang, "lacking taste or style") + *-ness* (suffix forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition).  The origin of *naff* is uncertain, but it may be related to Polari (a form of slang used in Britain by some actors, circus and fairground showmen, professional wrestlers, merchant navy sailors, criminals, prostitutes, and the gay subculture). Or it may derive from the acronym "Normal as Fuck".
