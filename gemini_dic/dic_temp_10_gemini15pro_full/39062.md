conformer:/kənˈfɔːrmər/| n. |构象异构体；顺应者|A conformer is one of a set of stereoisomers characterized by a conformation that corresponds to a distinct potential energy minimum.  It is one of multiple spatial arrangements of atoms that can be interconverted by rotations about formally single bonds. A conformer is also someone who conforms to accepted behavior or established practices. |The different conformers of butane have different energies.  丁烷的不同构象异构体具有不同的能量。| The social conformer followed all the rules. 这位社会顺应者遵守了所有的规则。 |synonyms: isomer, rotamer, conformist| antonyms: nonconformist, rebel| noun


conformer:/kənˈfɔːrmər/| n. |构象异构体；顺应者|A conformer is a specific three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule that results from rotation around single bonds.  It also refers to a person who conforms to accepted behavior or established practices.|Cyclohexane exists in chair and boat conformers. 环己烷以椅式和船式构象异构体存在。|He was a conformer, always following the crowd. 他是一个顺应者，总是随波逐流。|synonyms: isomer, rotamer, conformist| antonyms: nonconformist, individualist| noun
