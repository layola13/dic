注意事项:

Since "myselven" is archaic, providing examples in modern English tenses is not possible.  The word is found in older texts like Chaucer.  A contrived example might be:  "I shalle avaunce myselven to the kyng." (I shall advance myself to the king.)  But this is not natural modern English.  It would be understood as a deliberately archaic usage.
