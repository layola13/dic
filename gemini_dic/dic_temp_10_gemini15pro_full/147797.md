词源: From "overprotective" + "-ness."  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "too much." "Protective" comes from the Latin "protectus," the past participle of "protegere," meaning "to cover in front," from "pro-" (before) + "tegere" (to cover).  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.
