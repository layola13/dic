Etymology:
From Latin *discerpere, from dis- "apart" + carpere "to pluck, harvest".  This reconstructed Latin verb *discerpere is the hypothetical source of the English adjective "discerptive".  While "discerptive" isn't directly attested in classical Latin, its meaning and formation are clearly derived from common Latin prefixes and roots.  The related and more common English word "discerpt," meaning "extract" or "excerpt," shares the same Latin root.
