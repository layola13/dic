注意事项:

*nonne* is primarily used in Latin and is less common in modern English.  While grammatically correct in English, it may sound archaic or overly formal.  It's more common to use the standard English question forms (e.g., "Isn't it?", "Doesn't he?").  Its primary use in English is in academic or highly formal settings, or when deliberately trying to evoke a classical tone.
