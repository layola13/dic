注意事项:

*  "detail's" with an apostrophe is grammatically incorrect. The correct plural form is "details."  This entire explanation uses the corrected form.  The provided examples are all based on the correct plural form "details".
* The word "detail" can also function as a verb, meaning "to describe item by item; to give the details of." However, the prompt specifically requested an analysis of "detail's" suggesting the noun form (though incorrectly punctuated).
