ETYMOLOGY->

From Old French *gai* "joyful, merry," ultimately of Germanic origin.  The meaning shifted to "bright, showy" and then to "dissolute" in the 17th century.  The association with homosexuality emerged in the early 20th century, initially as slang, and became the dominant meaning by the late 20th century.
