词源:  "Keyed-in" is derived from the verb "key in," which originally referred to the act of entering data using a keyboard, particularly on older keypunch machines or early computer terminals.  The "-ed" suffix transforms it into a past participle, which can function as an adjective. The sense of "well-informed" likely developed metaphorically, suggesting that someone who is "keyed-in" has all the necessary information "inputted" into their understanding.
