词源：
"Flash mob" is a compound word, combining "flash," meaning a sudden, brief burst of something, and "mob," referring to a large crowd of people. The term was coined in 2003 by blogger Bill Wasik, although the phenomenon itself predates the name. The "mobbing" suffix simply turns the noun "flash mob" into a gerund, indicating the act of participating in such an event.
