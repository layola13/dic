carboxide: /kɑːrˈbɒksaɪd/
n.
一氧化碳; 碳氧化物
A binary compound of carbon with oxygen.  Specifically carbon monoxide (CO).
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and highly toxic gas formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur from breathing in too much of the gas.

Synonyms: carbon monoxide, CO
Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms for a chemical compound.  One might consider oxygen or fresh air as opposing concepts in the context of safety.)
