词源: From Late Latin contentus, past participle of continēre "to hold together, contain, restrain," from com- "together" (see com-) + tenēre "to hold" (from PIE root *ten- "to stretch").  The sense evolution is from "contained" to "mentally restrained, having one's desires limited," hence "satisfied."
