ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin incumbentem (nominative incumbens), present participle of incumbere “to lie or lean upon, press upon, apply oneself to,” from in- “on, upon” + -cumbere “to lie down” (related to cubare “to lie”). The original sense of “resting or lying on” developed into the figurative sense of “being responsible for” or “holding a position.”
