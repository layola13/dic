narland:/ˈnɑːrlənd/ | n. | 纳兰 |  "Narland" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It might be a surname, a place name (perhaps fictional), or a neologism. Without further context, it's difficult to provide a definitive meaning.  It could potentially be a misspelling of "Narnia" from C.S. Lewis's chronicles.  | Example:  (Assuming it's a place name) They traveled to Narland seeking adventure. 他们前往纳兰寻求冒险。 | Synonym:  (Dependent on actual meaning - potentially "land," "country," "realm" if it refers to a place) | Antonym: (Dependent on actual meaning) | noun
