panidiomorphic:/ˌpænɪdiəˈmɔːfɪk/ | adj. | 全自形 |  A textural term for igneous rocks in which all the constituent minerals are euhedral, i.e., entirely bounded by their own crystal faces. | The rock sample displayed a panidiomorphic texture, with each mineral grain perfectly formed.  岩石样本呈现全自形结构，每个矿物颗粒都完美成形。 | Example: The granite displayed a panidiomorphic texture, indicating slow cooling and crystallization.  例如：花岗岩呈现全自形结构，表明缓慢冷却和结晶。 | Near Synonyms: euhedral, idiomorphic | Antonyms: anhedral, subhedral | adjective
