The word "bawrel" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a dialectal variant.  Did you perhaps mean "barrel"?

If you meant "barrel," here's the analysis:

barrel:/ˈbærəl/ | n. | 桶；枪管；一桶的量 | A cylindrical container bulging in the middle, traditionally made of wooden staves bound by hoops and having flat ends.|  The wine was aged in oak barrels.  葡萄酒在橡木桶中陈酿。| synonyms: cask, keg, drum | antonyms:  (No direct antonym for a physical object; perhaps "containerless") | noun
