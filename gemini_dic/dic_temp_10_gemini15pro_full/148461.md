ETYMOLOGY->
"over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *uberi, meaning "above, beyond, over") + "straight" (Old English streht, from Proto-Germanic *straxtiz, meaning "straight, direct") + "-ness" (Old English -nes(s), a suffix forming nouns from adjectives, denoting state, quality, or condition).  Therefore, "overstraightnesses" signifies the state or quality of being excessively straight or rigid.
