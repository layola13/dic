interrepulsion:/ˌɪntərɪˈpʌlʃən/ | n. |相互排斥，互相排斥|The interrepulsion between the electrons keeps them apart. 电子之间的相互排斥使它们彼此分离。|例句：The interrepulsion between the two magnets was strong.  两个磁铁之间的相互排斥力很强。

The interrepulsion of the oil and water molecules prevented them from mixing. 油和水分子的相互排斥阻止了它们混合。|近义词：repulsion, mutual repulsion, |反义词:attraction, mutual attraction |词性:名词

词源:  From inter- + repulsion.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among," and "repulsion" comes from the Latin "repulsio," meaning "a driving back."
