noncomputations:/ˌnɒnkɒmpjuˈteɪʃənz/ | n. | 非计算，非计算过程 |  Processes or operations that do not involve mathematical calculation or algorithmic processing.  This term is often used in contrast to "computations" to describe tasks that are more qualitative, interpretive, or based on human judgment. |  Many aspects of artistic creation are noncomputations, relying on intuition and aesthetic sensibility rather than formulaic procedures. 许多艺术创作的方面都是非计算的，依赖于直觉和审美感受，而不是公式化的程序。

Noncomputations, like understanding emotions, are crucial for human interaction.  像理解情绪这样的非计算过程对人类互动至关重要。 | 近义词: non-calculations, non-algorithmic processes | 反义词: computations, calculations, algorithmic processes | 词性: 名词
