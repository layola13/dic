注意事项:

*  "Belike" is very informal and primarily used in spoken English, especially among younger speakers.  It's generally not suitable for formal writing.

*  While its literal meaning is "to be like," it's primarily used to report speech or describe actions, not to compare similarity.  For comparison, "resemble" or "be similar to" are more appropriate.
