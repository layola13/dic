"Beleper" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a technical term, a regionalism, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you could provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some suggestions.  For example, is it a name, a place, a product, or something you heard in a song or movie?

However, since you requested information on how to analyze a word, I can provide a template using a real word, "happen,"  and you can adapt it to any word you find:

happen:/ˈhæpən/ |v. |发生，出现|To occur, to take place, to come to pass. |例句：The accident happened yesterday. 事故发生在昨天。|例句：What happened next surprised everyone.  接下来发生的事情让每个人都感到惊讶。|近义词：occur, transpire, befall|反义词: cease, stop |词性:动词
