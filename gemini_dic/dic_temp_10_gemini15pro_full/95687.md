ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *inconcoctionem, accusative of inconcoctio, "imperfect digestion, indigestion," from in- "not" + concoctionem, accusative of concoctio "a mixing together, digesting," from concoquere "to boil together, digest," from com- "together" + coquere "to cook." The figurative sense of "something made up" arose from the notion of something not fully or properly formed.
