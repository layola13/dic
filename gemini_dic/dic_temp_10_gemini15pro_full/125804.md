Etymology: From murky + -ness + -es.  "Murky" comes from the Middle English *mirke*, akin to Old English *mierce* "dark," of Germanic origin; related to Old Norse *myrkr* "darkness."  The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. The suffix "-es" creates the plural form.
