注意事项:  Denny's is a proper noun, so it doesn't have a true etymology in the same way a common noun does.  It's named after Harold Butler and Richard Jezak, who originally founded it as Danny's Donuts in 1953. The name changed to Denny's later.  It primarily functions as a noun and specifically as a proper noun.
