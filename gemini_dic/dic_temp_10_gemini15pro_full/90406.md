PHRASE->

(Howso is not commonly used in set phrases.  It functions more as a standalone adverb.  Therefore, instead of phrases, here are some sentences demonstrating its usage in different contexts.)

1. "I solved the puzzle." "Howso?" = “我解开了谜题。”“怎么解开的？”
2.  He claims to have seen a ghost. Howso? = 他声称看到鬼了。怎么回事？
3.  You think it's a good idea? Howso? = 你觉得这是个好主意？为什么？

注意事项:
Howso is somewhat archaic and less common in modern English.  "How" or "Why" are generally preferred.  It can sound slightly formal or even pretentious in some contexts.  It's more common in British English than American English.
