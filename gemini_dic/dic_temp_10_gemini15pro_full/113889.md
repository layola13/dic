The word "madreperl" doesn't exist in standard English or Spanish dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  The closest word is "mother-of-pearl," which refers to the iridescent inner layer of certain mollusk shells.  I will provide an analysis for "mother-of-pearl."
