ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *drān, from Proto-Germanic *dranō (“drone bee”), from Proto-Indo-European *dhren- (“to drone, buzz, roar”). Cognate with Dutch dreunen (“to drone”), German dröhnen (“to drone, roar”). The noun sense "male bee" is from late Middle English. The sense "pilotless aircraft" is from 1946, by analogy with the male bee's lazy flight.
