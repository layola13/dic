biliverdin:/ˈbɪlɪˌvɜːrdɪn/| n.|胆绿素|A green bile pigment formed by the oxidation of bilirubin. It is a precursor of bilirubin in the normal catabolic pathway of heme.|The bruise turned a shade of biliverdin as it healed.|近义词:heme breakdown product|反义词:None|词性:noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From French *biliverdine, from bili- + verd, from Latin viridis "green".

USAGE->

一般现在时 (Simple Present):

The enzyme has converted biliverdin to bilirubin. = 这种酶已将胆绿素转化为胆红素。
The bruise has turned yellow because the biliverdin has been further metabolized. = 由于胆绿素被进一步代谢，瘀伤变成了黄色。

现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The body has been producing biliverdin as part of the heme breakdown process. = 身体一直在产生胆绿素，这是血红素分解过程的一部分。
Scientists have been studying biliverdin for its potential antioxidant properties. = 科学家们一直在研究胆绿素的潜在抗氧化特性。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The bruise initially appeared green because of biliverdin. = 由于胆绿素，瘀伤最初呈绿色。
Researchers discovered the role of biliverdin in heme catabolism. = 研究人员发现了胆绿素在血红素分解代谢中的作用。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The body was breaking down heme and producing biliverdin. = 身体正在分解血红素并产生胆绿素。
The bruise was changing color as the biliverdin was being converted to bilirubin. = 随着胆绿素转化为胆红素，瘀伤的颜色正在发生变化。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The body had already produced biliverdin before the bruise turned yellow. = 在瘀伤变黄之前，身体已经产生了胆绿素。
Scientists had studied biliverdin before they discovered its antioxidant properties. = 在科学家们发现胆绿素的抗氧化特性之前，他们已经研究过胆绿素。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The body had been producing biliverdin for some time before the bruise became visible. = 在瘀伤变得可见之前，身体已经产生胆绿素一段时间了。
Researchers had been studying biliverdin for years before they understood its full function. = 研究人员在完全了解胆绿素的功能之前已经研究了多年。

一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The bruise will turn yellow as the biliverdin is converted to bilirubin. = 随着胆绿素转化为胆红素，瘀伤会变黄。
Further research will reveal more about the functions of biliverdin. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于胆绿素的功能。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The body will be breaking down heme and producing biliverdin as part of the normal physiological process. = 作为正常生理过程的一部分，身体将分解血红素并产生胆绿素。
Scientists will be studying the potential therapeutic applications of biliverdin. = 科学家们将研究胆绿素的潜在治疗应用。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By next week, the bruise will have turned yellow, indicating the biliverdin has been converted. = 到下周，瘀伤会变黄，表明胆绿素已经转化了。
By the end of the study, researchers will have identified the key functions of biliverdin. = 到研究结束时，研究人员将确定胆绿素的关键功能。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next month, the body will have been processing biliverdin as part of its natural functions. = 到下个月，身体将一直处理胆绿素，作为其自然功能的一部分。
By the time the research is complete, scientists will have been studying biliverdin for several years. = 到研究完成时，科学家们将已经研究胆绿素好几年了。


PHRASE->
