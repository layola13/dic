finlands:/ˈfɪnləndz/ | n. | 芬兰（复数形式，不常用）| Finland is the singular form, referring to the country.  "Finlands" is grammatically incorrect and not typically used. It might appear in very rare poetic or literary contexts to create a specific effect, perhaps suggesting multiple facets of Finnish culture or identity.  However, standard usage is always "Finland."|  (Due to its unusual nature, standard example sentences are difficult to provide.  A contrived example would be: "The poet spoke of many Finlands, each representing a different era of its history." This usage is highly stylistic and not recommended.) | Synonym: (Singular) Finland | Antonym: N/A | Noun
