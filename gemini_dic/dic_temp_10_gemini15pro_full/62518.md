ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *ende (attested only in compounds like æfterende "after-end"), from Proto-Germanic *andiz (source also of Old Saxon endi, Old Frisian ende, Old Norse endi, Dutch eind, German Ende), from Proto-Indo-European *h₂énti- "forehead, front, before." The sense shifted from "front" to "limit, extremity" in Germanic.
