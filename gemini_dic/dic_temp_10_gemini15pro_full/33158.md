chromatographies: /ˌkroʊməˈtɒɡrəfiz/ | n. | 色谱法 |  A laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate. | Several different chromatographies were employed to identify the components of the sample.  几种不同的色谱法被用来鉴定样品的成分。 | synonyms: chromatography, separation methods | antonyms: mixture, combination | noun
