词源: From Old English *lēofdigecocc, composed of lēofdige "lady" (in Old English especially referring to the Virgin Mary) + cocc "beetle, insect".  The connection to Mary is thought to come from the seven spots of the common seven-spotted ladybird, which were associated with the seven joys or seven sorrows of Mary.  The word "bug" replaced "cocc" later, and "ladybug" is the predominant form in North America.
