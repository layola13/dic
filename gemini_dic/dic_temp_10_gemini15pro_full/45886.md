ETYMOLOGY->
From cute + -sy (a suffix forming adjectives meaning 'having the quality of', 'full of', 'like', 'somewhat', 'given to').  "Cute" itself is likely a shortening of "acute," originally meaning sharp or clever, but later evolving to mean attractive in a dainty way.  The addition of "-sy" emphasizes and sometimes exaggerates this cuteness, often implying artificiality or affectation.
