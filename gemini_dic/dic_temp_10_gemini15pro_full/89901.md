ETYMOLOGY->
From horrified + -ly.  Horrified comes from the verb horrify, which in turn comes from the Latin word horrificāre, meaning "to make terrible or frightful."  The Latin word is derived from horrificus, meaning "causing terror," and ultimately from horrēre, "to bristle," "to shudder," or "to be terrified."
