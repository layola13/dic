词源:
"Electromagnetically" comes from "electromagnetic" + "-ly."  "Electromagnetic" is a combination of "electro-" (from "electric") and "magnetic."  "Electric" ultimately derives from the Greek word "elektron" for amber, as static electricity was first observed by rubbing amber. "Magnetic" comes from the Greek "Magnēs lithos," meaning "Magnesian stone," referring to lodestone, a naturally magnetic iron ore found in Magnesia, a region of ancient Greece.  The suffix "-ly" transforms adjectives into adverbs.
