Etymology:
From Latin *lātifolius*, from *lātus* (broad, wide) + *folium* (leaf). However, "laterifolious" refers to the *timing* of leaf production, not the *size* of the leaves, so the association with "lātus" (broad) is misleading.  It's likely formed by analogy with words like "latifolious" (broad-leaved), but with "lateri-" meaning "late."
