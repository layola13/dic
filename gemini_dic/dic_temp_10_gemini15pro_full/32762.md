词源:  chocaholic is a blend of "chocolate" and "alcoholic."  "Alcoholic" itself is derived from "alcohol" + "-ic."  "Alcohol" ultimately comes from Arabic "al-kuḥl," referring to a fine powder used as eye makeup. The meaning later shifted to refer to the essence of something, and then to distilled spirits.  "-ic" is a suffix forming adjectives, often from nouns. Thus, "chocaholic" mimics the structure and implies an addiction similar to alcoholism, but for chocolate.
