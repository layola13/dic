hyperstatic:/ˌhaɪpərˈstætɪk/| adj.|超静定的，静不定次数大于零的|A structure is hyperstatic if it has more supports or restraints than are strictly necessary for stability, making it statically indeterminate.|The bridge design was hyperstatic, incorporating redundant supports for increased safety.|近义词：statically indeterminate, redundant, over-constrained|反义词：statically determinate, isostatic|词性:形容词
词源: From Greek *hyper* ("over, beyond") + *statikos* ("causing to stand").
