isostatic:/ˌaɪsəˈstætɪk/ | adj. | 等静压的，地壳均衡的 |  Relating to or characterized by isostasy, a state of gravitational equilibrium between Earth's lithosphere and asthenosphere such that the tectonic plates "float" at an elevation that depends on their thickness and density. | The Earth's crust is believed to be in isostatic equilibrium.  地球的地壳被认为处于地壳均衡状态。| The isostatic rebound following the last ice age is still shaping the landscape of Scandinavia.  末次冰期后的均衡回弹仍在塑造斯堪的纳维亚半岛的地貌。 |  balanced, equilibrated | unstable | adjective
