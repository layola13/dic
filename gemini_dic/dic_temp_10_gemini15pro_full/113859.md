词源:  "Made-up" is a compound adjective formed from the past participle "made" and the adverb/preposition "up."  "Made" comes from Old English "makian,"  and "up" from Old English "up" or "upp."  The combined meaning evolved to signify something created or constructed, and later extended to include the sense of fabricated or invented, and also to the application of cosmetics.
