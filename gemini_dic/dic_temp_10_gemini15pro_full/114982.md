"Mancona" isn't a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a newly coined word, a proper noun (like a place name), or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, if it's a misspelling, I can suggest possible correct spellings.


However, I can still demonstrate the requested format using the word "question" as an example:

question: /ˈkwɛstʃən/ | n. vt. | 问题；疑问；询问 |  A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information. |  例句：She asked a difficult question. 她问了一个难题。 | 例句：He questioned the witness. 他询问了证人。 | 近义词：inquiry, query | 反义词: answer, reply | 词性: noun, verb
