注意事项:
This word "express's" is not very common. It's much more natural to refer to the company by name, e.g., "FedEx's delivery truck" or to use a more general term like "the delivery company's truck."  While grammatically correct, "express's" feels somewhat awkward and forced in most contexts.  Using the company's name or a more general term is recommended.
