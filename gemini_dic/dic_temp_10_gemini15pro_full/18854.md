ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *beseken*, from Old English *besēcan* (“to seek, beseech, implore, ask, beg”), from *be-* (intensifying prefix) + *sēcan* (“to seek”). Cognate with Dutch *bezoeken* (“to visit”), German *besuchen* (“to visit”), Swedish *besöka* (“to visit”). The original sense of "seeking out" narrowed to "seeking help or favor."
