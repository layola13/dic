词源:  The origin of "chivvy" is uncertain. One theory suggests it's related to the Romany word *chiv*, meaning "knife" or "sharp object," implying a sense of prodding or urging. Another possibility connects it to the French word *cheval*, meaning "horse," suggesting the idea of driving or urging forward.
