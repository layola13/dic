PHRASE->
(Jenite doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases.  It's a specialized term primarily used in geological and mineralogical contexts. Therefore, providing general phrases like "what if" wouldn't be relevant. Instead, I offer examples of phrases used in a geological context that *could* involve jenite.)

crystals of jenite  钙铁榴石晶体
a sample of jenite  钙铁榴石样本
jenite deposits 钙铁榴石矿床
jenite formation 钙铁榴石的形成
jenite identification 钙铁榴石鉴定
