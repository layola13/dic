PHRASE->
(Since "chevaux" is a plural French noun, it doesn't typically appear in English phrases.  These phrases use the English equivalent, "horses.")
wild horses = 野马
hold your horses = 别急；稍等
horse around = 胡闹；嬉戏
dark horse = 黑马（指实力难以预测的竞争者）
from the horse's mouth = 来自权威人士；来自可靠消息

注意事项:
As noted, "chevaux" is already plural; there's no singular or further pluralization in standard usage. It is less common in everyday English and more likely found in literary or formal contexts.  Using "horses" is generally preferred.
