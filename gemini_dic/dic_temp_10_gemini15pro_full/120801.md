Etymology:
mis- (prefix):  Old English *mis-, from Proto-Germanic *missa- "wrongly, astray," from PIE root *mei- (1) "to change, go, move."
assemble: from Old French assembler "to join together," from Vulgar Latin *assimulare, frequentative of Latin assimulare "to make like," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + simulare "to copy, represent, feign," from similis "like" (see similar).
