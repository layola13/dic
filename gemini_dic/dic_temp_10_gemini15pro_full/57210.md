PHRASE->

(Downcastly is typically used on its own and doesn't form common phrases.  It describes the manner in which something is done.  Therefore, providing phrases is difficult and likely unnatural.)


注意事项:  As noted, "downcastly" is less common than its adjective form "downcast". It's more natural in many instances to use "downcast" with a verb like "he walked downcast to his room" or "she spoke in a downcast manner."
