adverb
无机地
not involving or coming from living things; not organic
例句：

近义词：non-organically, abiotically
反义词：organically, biotically
词性：adverb

词源：
in- (not) + organic + -ally (adverbial suffix)
From "in-" (Latin, "not") + "organic" (from Late Latin "organicus," meaning "serving as instruments, of or pertaining to an organ," from Greek "organikos," from "organon" meaning "instrument, tool, organ") + "-ally" (adverbial suffix).
