associativenesses:/əˌsoʊʃiətɪvnɪsɪz/| n. |结合性；结合律|The property of an operation whereby the order in which operations are performed does not change the result (e.g., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)).  In mathematics, particularly in abstract algebra, associativity is a property of some binary operations. |The associativenesses of addition and multiplication are fundamental properties of arithmetic. 加法和乘法的结合性是算术的基本性质。| The proof relies on the associativenesses of the group operation.  这个证明依赖于群运算的结合性。| synonym: associativity | antonym: non-associativity | noun
