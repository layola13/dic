nonsubstituted:/ˌnɒnsʌbˈstɪtjuːtɪd/ | adj. | 未取代的，未被取代的 | Not having had a substituent added or replaced.  A nonsubstituted compound is one in which all the hydrogen atoms are still present, and no other atoms or groups have replaced them. | This reaction requires a nonsubstituted benzene ring. 这个反应需要一个未取代的苯环。| The nonsubstituted alkane reacted slowly.  未取代的烷烃反应缓慢。| 近义词: unsubstituted, original | 反义词: substituted, derivatized | 词性: 形容词 | 词源:  non- (not) + substituted (from substitute, ultimately from Latin *substitutus, past participle of substituere, "to put in place of")
