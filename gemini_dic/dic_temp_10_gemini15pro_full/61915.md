ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *empyreumatizāre, from empyreuma (“burnt substance; the empyrean”) + -izāre (suffix forming verbs). Empyreuma is from Ancient Greek ἐμπύρευμα (empýreuma, “burnt substance, thing burnt by fire”), from ἐμπυρεύω (empyreúō, “to kindle, set on fire”), from ἐν (en, “in”) + πῦρ (pûr, “fire”).  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *péh₂wr̥ (“fire”).
