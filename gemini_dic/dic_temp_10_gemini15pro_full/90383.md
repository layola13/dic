PHRASE->
There is no common phrase using "howdying". This word is typically used on its own to describe a state of decline or near death.


词源： "howdying" is a Scottish and Northern English dialect word, likely derived from "howdie," meaning midwife.  The connection may stem from the midwife's presence at both birth and death, or the weakened state of someone near death.
