ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *abhorren*, from Old French *abhorrer*, from Latin *abhorrēre* (“to shrink back from, shudder at, be horrified at, detest”), from *ab* (“away from”) + *horrēre* (“to bristle, shudder, tremble”). The word *horrēre* is related to *horridus* (“rough, bristly, shaggy; horrible”), from *horrēre* (“to stand on end, bristle”) and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰers-* (“to bristle”).
