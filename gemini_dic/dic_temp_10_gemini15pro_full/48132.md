decohered:/ˌdiːkoʊˈhɪərd/ | v. | 退相干 |  Lost coherence, especially as a result of interaction with the environment.  This term is primarily used in physics, particularly in quantum mechanics. | The quantum system decohered rapidly due to its interaction with the surrounding environment.  量子系统由于与周围环境的相互作用而迅速退相干。

The qubit decohered before the computation could be completed.  量子位在计算完成之前就退相干了。 | 近义词: deteriorated, disintegrated (in a quantum context) | 反义词: cohered, entangled (in a quantum context) | 词性: 动词 (past participle)

词源:  "De-" (prefix indicating reversal or removal) + "cohere" (from Latin "cohaerere" - to stick together) + "-ed" (past participle suffix)
