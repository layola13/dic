PHRASE->

(Due to the archaic nature of "aski," it doesn't readily form common phrases.  It would be more natural to use "who" in modern English.  The following are examples of how "who" might be used in similar contexts):

Who's there?  谁在那儿？
Who are you? 你是谁？
Who cares?  谁在乎？
Who knows? 谁知道？
Who's with me? 谁和我一起？

注意事项:

"Aski" is very rarely used in modern English. "Who" is the standard and preferred interrogative pronoun.  While grammatically correct in the examples above, using "aski" would sound extremely old-fashioned or dialectal.
