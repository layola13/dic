Etymology:
From contestable + -ness.  "Contestable" comes from the Old French "contester" (to dispute, contend), which in turn derives from the Latin "contestari" (to call to witness, to invoke), from "con-" (together) + "testari" (to bear witness).  The suffix "-ness" is used to form nouns expressing a state or quality.
