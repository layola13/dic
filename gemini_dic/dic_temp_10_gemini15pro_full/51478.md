Etymology:
From detoxification + -s (plural suffix).  Detoxification comes from de- (prefix meaning "remove" or "reverse") + toxic + -fication (suffix forming nouns from verbs). Toxic ultimately derives from the Greek word *toxikon (pharmakon)* meaning "(poison) (for arrows)," with *pharmakon* meaning "drug, poison, or spell."
