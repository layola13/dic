ethylenic:/ˌeθɪˈliːnɪk/ | adj. |乙烯的，含乙烯基的| Relating to or containing ethylene, a gaseous hydrocarbon with the formula C2H4. | Ethylene is an ethylenic hydrocarbon. 乙烯是一种乙烯烃。|  Ethylene oxide is an important ethylenic compound. 环氧乙烷是一种重要的乙烯化合物。 | 近义词: unsaturated, olefinic | 反义词: saturated | 词性: adjective

词源:  From ethylene + -ic. Ethylene itself comes from ethyl + -ene, with ethyl ultimately from ether + -yl, reflecting its early preparation from diethyl ether.
