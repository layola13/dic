词源: From Latin ferruminari "to solder, cement," figuratively "to join together," from ferrumen "cement, rust," from ferrum "iron."  The sense of "chew the cud" arose from the notion of repeatedly bringing up and working over the same material.  Figurative use for "ponder, meditate" developed from this sense.
