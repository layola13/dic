ETYMOLOGY->
From adventure + -ful.  "Adventure" comes from Old French "aventure" meaning "chance," "fortune," "happening," ultimately from Latin "adventura" "a thing about to happen." "-ful" is a suffix meaning "full of," "characterized by."


USAGE->
This word isn't standard English. While grammatically correct in its formation, it's rarely used. "Adventurous" is the preferred and more common term.  Therefore, providing usage examples in different tenses is not applicable as native speakers would avoid using this word.  It's best to replace "adventureful" with "adventurous."


PHRASE->
