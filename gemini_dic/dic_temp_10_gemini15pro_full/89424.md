homozygotic:/ˌhoʊmoʊzaɪˈɡɒtɪk/ /ˌhɒməʊzaɪˈɡɒtɪk/ | adj. | 纯合的 | Having two identical alleles of a particular gene or genes. |  Example 1: The plant is homozygotic for the dominant allele.  这种植物对显性等位基因是纯合的。

Example 2: Homozygotic individuals are more likely to express recessive traits. 纯合个体更有可能表达隐性性状。 | 近义词: purebred, homozygous | 反义词: heterozygotic, hybrid | 词性: 形容词

homozygote:/ˌhoʊmoʊˈzaɪɡoʊt/ /ˌhɒməʊˈzaɪɡəʊt/ | n. | 纯合子 | An individual having two identical alleles of a particular gene or genes. | Example 1: The homozygote showed no signs of the disease.  这个纯合子没有表现出疾病的迹象。

Example 2:  Homozygotes for the recessive allele will exhibit the recessive trait. 隐性等位基因的纯合子将表现出隐性性状。| 近义词: purebred | 反义词: heterozygote | 词性: 名词


homozygosity:/ˌhoʊmoʊzaɪˈɡɒsɪti/ /ˌhɒməʊzaɪˈɡɒsɪti/ | n. | 纯合性 | The state of being homozygous. | Example 1:  High homozygosity can lead to reduced fitness in a population.  高纯合性会导致种群适应性下降。

Example 2: The researchers studied the effects of homozygosity on disease resistance. 研究人员研究了纯合性对疾病抵抗力的影响。| 近义词:  purebredness| 反义词: heterozygosity | 词性: 名词

虚拟语气:
Example 1: If the individual were homozygotic for the recessive allele, they would express the trait. 如果该个体是隐性等位基因的纯合子，他们就会表达该性状。
Example 2:  If both parents were homozygotic for the dominant allele, all offspring would also be homozygotic. 如果父母双方都是显性等位基因的纯合子，那么所有后代也将是纯合子。


被动语态:
