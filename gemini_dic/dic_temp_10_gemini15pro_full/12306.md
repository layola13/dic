ascospore:/ˈæskəˌspɔːr/
n.
子囊孢子
A spore formed within an ascus.  A sexual spore formed in an ascus (saclike structure) typical of ascomycetes.
Example: The ascospores are released from the ascus when it matures. 子囊孢子在子囊成熟时从子囊中释放出来。

Example: The researchers studied the morphology of the ascospores under a microscope. 研究人员在显微镜下研究了子囊孢子的形态。

Near Synonyms: spore, meiospore
Antonyms: (No direct antonym, but perhaps vegetative cell, as it represents asexual reproduction)
Etymology:  From ascus + -spore.  Ascus comes from the Greek "askos" meaning "bag" or "wine-skin".
Word Type: Noun
