词源:  "jeck" is likely a misspelling of "jack," which in the context of clothing refers to a short coat and in nautical terms refers to a sailor.  "Jack" as a term for a sailor comes from the Middle Ages, possibly from the name "Jack" being common, or from its use in phrases like "Jack-of-all-trades." The use of "jack" for a type of coat also has uncertain origins, but it likely developed from the use of the name "jack" to represent a common man or thing.
