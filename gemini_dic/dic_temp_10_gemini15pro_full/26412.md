注意事项:
"Byee" is very informal and generally used in spoken language or casual online communication. It's less common in formal writing.  "Byee" sometimes implies a longer separation than a simple "bye". While the extra "e" doesn't inherently change the meaning, it can add a sense of finality or playfulness.
