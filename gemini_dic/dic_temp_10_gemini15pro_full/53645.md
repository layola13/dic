PHRASE->

(While "discession" isn't commonly used in phrases, here are some related phrases using the more common "dissection":)

dissection of the issue = 对问题的剖析
a detailed dissection of the evidence = 对证据的详细剖析
the dissection of the body = 尸体的解剖
a careful dissection of the argument = 对论点的仔细剖析
the dissection of the data = 对数据的分析


注意事项:

"Discession" while a valid word, is significantly less common than "dissection."  In most contexts, "dissection" is the preferred term.  "Discession" carries a slightly older and more formal tone.  It can also sometimes be confused with "dissension" (disagreement).
