ETYMOLOGY->
From "care" + "take." "Care" comes from Old English "caru" meaning "anxiety, sorrow, grief," later evolving to mean "attention, heed, charge." "Take" comes from Old English "tacan" meaning "to grasp, seize, lay hold of." The combined form "caretake" originally emerged as a noun in the 16th century, referring to a person who takes care of something.  The verb form, "caretook," developed later.
