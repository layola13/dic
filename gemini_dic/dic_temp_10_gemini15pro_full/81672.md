**词源:**

"Greenage's" is a neologism (a newly coined word or expression) combining "green" (referring to environmentalism) and "age" (referring to a period of time). The possessive form ('s) indicates a period characterized by these qualities, similar to how we use terms like "Stone Age" or "Information Age".  While not a standard dictionary entry yet, its construction allows for intuitive understanding.
