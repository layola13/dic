PHRASE-> (While "borcan" is a Romanian word, constructing English phrases with it requires contextual understanding within a Romanian-speaking environment.  Direct English phrases are less common. Here are some examples based on usage):

Un borcan de... (A jar of...)  Un borcan de murături (A jar of pickles)
Am nevoie de un borcan. (I need a jar.)
Borcanul este plin. (The jar is full.)
Borcanul este gol. (The jar is empty.)
Pune-l în borcan. (Put it in the jar.)


注意事项:
Since "borcan" is a Romanian word, it doesn't have a direct English equivalent, and its usage in English contexts is limited. It would primarily be used when referring specifically to this type of container in a Romanian context.  It is not a common English word.
