hash's:/hæʃɪz/| n.|哈希值，散列值|A hash is a function that converts one value to another.  Hash's refers to the possessive form, indicating something belongs to or is associated with a hash.  It's most commonly used in the context of "hash's value" or something similar, though often expressed simply as "the hash value".|This algorithm calculates the hash's value for secure storage.|近义词：hash value, checksum, fingerprint|反义词:|n.
