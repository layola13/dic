PHRASE->
(This word doesn't readily form common phrases.  It's best to avoid using it in phrases and opt for clearer alternatives.)
Instead of focusing on the "materialnesses" of objects, consider their "material properties."  与其关注物体的“物质性”，不如考虑它们的“物质属性”。


注意事项:
As previously stated, "materialnesses" is not a commonly used or natural-sounding word.  While grammatically correct, it's strongly recommended to use alternatives like "material nature," "material qualities," "material properties," or "physicality" for clearer and more natural expression.
