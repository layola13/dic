magnetomotor:/ˌmæɡˌniːtəˈmoʊtər/ |adj.| 磁动势的|Relating to or producing magnetomotive force, which is the force that produces magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit.  It's analogous to electromotive force (voltage) in an electric circuit.|The magnetomotor force is the product of the number of turns in a coil and the current flowing through it.|近义词:magnetic|反义词:non-magnetic|词性:adjective


magnetomotor:/ˌmæɡˌniːtəˈmoʊtər/|n.| 磁动势|Magnetomotive force, often abbreviated as MMF, is the force that produces magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit.  It's measured in ampere-turns (At).|The magnetomotor force generated by the coil created a strong magnetic field.|近义词:magnetic potential|反义词: (No direct antonym exists as it's a specific force)|词性:noun


Etymology:

From "magneto-" (relating to magnetism) + "motor" (producing motion), reflecting its role in generating magnetic flux.
