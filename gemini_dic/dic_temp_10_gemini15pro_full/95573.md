incombine:/ɪnkəmˈbaɪn/ | adj. | 不能结合的，不相容的 | Not able to be combined; incompatible. | This chemical is incombine with water.  这种化学物质与水不相容。| The two theories are incombine. 这两种理论不相容。 | 近义词: incompatible, conflicting, discordant, irreconcilable | 反义词: compatible, harmonious, consistent | 词性: 形容词


词源:  "in-" (not) + "combine" (to join or mix together).  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "combine," creating the meaning of "not able to be combined."
