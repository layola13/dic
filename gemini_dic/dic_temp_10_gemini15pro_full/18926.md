词源:
"bespawl" comes from "be-" (a prefix meaning "to make" or "to cause to be") + "spawl" (meaning "saliva").  Therefore, the original meaning was "to cover with saliva."  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any sticky or unpleasant substance. "bespawl" 源自"be-"（一个表示“使”或“使成为”的前缀）+ "spawl"（意思是“唾液”）。因此，原来的意思是“用唾液覆盖”。随着时间的推移，其含义扩大到包括任何粘稠或令人不快的物质。
