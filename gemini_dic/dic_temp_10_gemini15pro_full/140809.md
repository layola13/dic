词源:  "On the fly" originated in the early 20th century, likely from baseball, where a "fly ball" is caught while in the air. The phrase expanded to mean "while in motion or progress."


注意事项:  "On-the-fly" is primarily used as an adverbial phrase. While a hyphenated form "on-the-fly" is common, "on the fly" (two words) is also acceptable.  Avoid using "on-fly" without "the."
