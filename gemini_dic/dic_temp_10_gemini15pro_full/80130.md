PHRASE->
(Gobsmacked is typically used on its own and doesn't have common set phrases.)


词源:  "Gob" is an informal term for "mouth," and "smacked" refers to the act of hitting.  So, "gobsmacked" literally means having one's mouth hit (presumably in surprise, causing it to close).  It's primarily British slang.
