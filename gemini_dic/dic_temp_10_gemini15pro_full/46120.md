cylindrometric:/ˌsɪlɪndrəˈmɛtrɪk/
adjective
圆柱测量的，圆柱测定法的
Relating to or used in cylindrometry, the measurement of the volume of gases.
Cylindrometric measurements are crucial for understanding engine performance.  圆柱测量对于理解发动机性能至关重要。
The cylindrometric apparatus was carefully calibrated before the experiment. 圆柱测量装置在实验前经过仔细校准。
近义词: volumetric (though not exactly the same, it relates to volume measurement)
反义词:  None (There isn't a direct antonym for a measurement method)
词性: adjective

Etymology:
From "cylindro-" (combining form relating to cylinders) + "-metric" (suffix relating to measurement).  "Cylindro-" ultimately derives from the Greek "kulindros" meaning "roller," "cylinder." "-metric" comes from the Greek "metron" meaning "measure."
