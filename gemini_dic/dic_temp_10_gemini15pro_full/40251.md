ETYMOLOGY->
"continental" comes from Late Middle English: from Old French, or from late Latin continentalis, from continens, continent- ‘holding together’, from the verb continere (from con- ‘together’ + tenere ‘to hold’).
"shield" comes from Old English scield, of West Germanic origin; related to Dutch schild and German Schild.
