Etymology:
From bareheaded + -ness.  Bareheaded itself comes from bare + head + -ed. "Bare" meaning uncovered or naked, and "head" referring to the top part of the body.  The suffix "-ed" creates the adjective form, and the suffix "-ness" turns the adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.
