methionine:/məˈθaɪəniːn/| n. |蛋氨酸;甲硫氨酸|An essential amino acid, meaning it cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained through diet. It contains sulfur and is important for various bodily functions, including protein synthesis and the growth of new tissues.|例句：Methionine is crucial for the growth of new tissues. 蛋氨酸对新组织的生长至关重要。

例句：Foods rich in methionine include meat, fish, and eggs. 富含蛋氨酸的食物包括肉、鱼和蛋。|近义词： (As an essential amino acid, it doesn't have direct synonyms, but other sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine and taurine play related roles.)|反义词: (None)|词性:noun
