词源:  "nonoppressively" is derived from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") added to "oppressive" (meaning "unjustly inflicting hardship and constraint, especially on a minority or other subordinate group"), combined with the suffix "-ly" to form an adverb.  "Oppressive" ultimately comes from the Latin word "opprimere," meaning "to press against" or "to suppress."
