词源: From Middle English *nete, from Old English *nēat (“cattle, beast”), ultimately from Proto-Germanic *nautą (“cattle”), from Proto-Indo-European *newət- (“useful, usable”).  The original meaning was "cattle," which evolved to "domesticated animal," then to "clean and well-groomed (as livestock ready for market)," and finally to the modern sense of "orderly and tidy."
