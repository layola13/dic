non-potential:/ˌnɒn pəˈtɛnʃəl/ | adj. | 非势的，非位的 | Not derivable from a potential; specifically (Mech.) not having or involving potential energy.  Relating to forces that are not conservative forces (forces that do work that depends on the path taken). | The frictional force is a non-potential force because the work done by friction depends on the path taken. 摩擦力是一种非势力，因为摩擦力所做的功取决于所走的路径。 |  The magnetic force on a moving charge is a non-potential force.  运动电荷受到的磁力是非势力。 |  non-conservative, dissipative | conservative, potential | adjective
