cementation:/ˌsɛmɛnˈteɪʃən/ | n. |胶结，胶结作用|The process in which loose sediments are bound together by the precipitation of mineral matter in their pore spaces.  The hardening and welding of clastic sediments (such as sand, gravel, or other rock debris) by the precipitation of mineral matter within the pore spaces.|Example 1: The cementation of the sand grains created a solid sandstone. 沙粒的胶结作用形成了坚固的砂岩。

Example 2:  The strength of the concrete depends on the proper cementation of the aggregate. 混凝土的强度取决于骨料的适当胶结。|Synonyms: consolidation, lithification, induration |Antonyms: erosion, weathering|noun
