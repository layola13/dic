chemiotaxis: /ˌkɛmi.oʊˈtæk.sɪs/ /ˌkiːmiːəʊˈtæksɪs/
noun
趋化性
The movement of an organism or cell in response to a chemical stimulus.
例句：

近义词：chemoattraction
反义词：chemorepulsion
词性：n.

Etymology:
From chemo- + taxis.  "Chemo-" comes from Greek *khēmeia* "alchemy," and "taxis" comes from Greek *taxis* "arrangement, order."
