nondegeneratenesses:/nɒndɪˈdʒɛnərətnəsɪz/| n. |非简并性；非退化性|The state or quality of being nondegenerate.  This typically refers to mathematical or scientific contexts where a system, structure, or solution avoids certain simplifying or limiting conditions.  In linear algebra, a nondegenerate matrix has a non-zero determinant.  In physics, a nondegenerate energy level corresponds to multiple distinct quantum states.| The nondegeneratenesses of the energy levels allowed for greater complexity in the system.|近义词:distinctiveness, multiplicity (in some contexts)|反义词:degeneracy, simplification|Noun
