mercator-projection: /mərˈkeɪtər prəˈdʒekʃən/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | A cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for navigation because of its unique property of representing any course of constant bearing as a straight segment.  It distorts sizes and shapes of landmasses, especially at high latitudes. | Example: The Mercator projection makes Greenland look much larger than it actually is relative to Africa. 墨卡托投影使格陵兰岛看起来比实际相对于非洲大得多。

Example: Navigators rely on the Mercator projection for plotting courses. 航海家依靠墨卡托投影来绘制航线。 | Synonym: cylindrical projection 圆柱投影 | Antonym:  (No direct antonym, but other projections like the Gall-Peters or Robinson are often contrasted with it)  没有直接的反义词，但其他投影，如高尔-彼得斯或罗宾逊投影，经常与之对比 | Noun
