词源：From item + -ize.  "Item" comes from the Latin "item" meaning "likewise, also."  "-ize" is a suffix used to form verbs meaning "to make or render; to subject to (a specified action)."  Therefore, "itemize" means to make into separate items.  "Itemizer" is simply the agent noun form of the verb "itemize."
