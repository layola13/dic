axons:/ˈæksɒnz/ (UK), /ˈæksɑːnz/ (US)| n. |轴突|A long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell body.|The axons of certain neurons can be quite long, sometimes even over a meter.|近义词:nerve fibers|反义词:(No direct antonym, but dendrites receive signals, while axons transmit them)|词性:Noun
