nullipore:/ˈnʌlɪˌpɔːr/ | n. | 无孔珊瑚；石珊瑚 | A type of calcareous alga or coral that lacks visible pores.  A now outdated term, as these organisms are not truly corals but are algae. |  The geologist mistakenly identified the nullipore as a true coral. 地质学家误将这种无孔珊瑚认定为真珊瑚。| synonym: coralline algae | antonym: (No direct antonym, perhaps "porous coral" as a contrasting concept, but not a true antonym) | noun

nullipore:/ˈnʌlɪˌpɔːr/ | adj. | 无孔的 | Lacking pores. (Rare usage) | The nullipore surface appeared smooth and unbroken. 无孔的表面看起来光滑且完整无缺。| synonym: nonporous, imperforate | antonym: porous, perforated | adjective
