PHRASE->
(Phrases in German are more complex and don't directly translate with "hatte" in the same way as English phrasal verbs.  It's more about the context of "haben" and its various uses.)


注意事项:
"Hatte" is the first and third person singular past tense conjugation of the verb "haben."  There are other forms for different persons and plural. It's crucial to understand that "hatte" is specifically a past tense form.  While English uses "had" as an auxiliary in other tenses, "hatte" in German is solely for the simple past.
