词源:  "havenage" is likely a combination of "haven" (a safe place) and the suffix "-age," which can denote a place or collection of something (as in "village" or "hermitage").  However, it's not a standard or widely recognized English word. "Haven" comes from Old English "hæfen" and Old Norse "höfn," both meaning "harbor."
