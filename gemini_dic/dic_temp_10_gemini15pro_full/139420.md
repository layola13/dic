Etymology:
From obsess + -ingly.  "Obsess" comes from the Latin *obsessus*, past participle of *obsidere* "to besiege, blockade, occupy," from *ob* "against, toward" + *sedere* "to sit."  The original sense was of a demon or evil spirit besieging a person. The suffix "-ingly" transforms adjectives into adverbs.
