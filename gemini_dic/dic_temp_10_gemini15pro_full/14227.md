autocoherer:/ˌɔːtəʊkoʊˈhɪərər/ |n.|自动相干器|A device used in early radio receivers to detect radio waves. It consisted of a tube containing loose metal filings that would clump together (cohere) when a radio wave passed through them, thus reducing the electrical resistance and allowing a current to flow. This current could then be used to activate a relay or other device to indicate the presence of the radio wave.|The autocoherer was a key component in Marconi's early wireless telegraphy experiments.|Synonym: coherer|Antonym: N/A|noun
