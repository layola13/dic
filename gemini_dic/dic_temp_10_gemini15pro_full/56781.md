词源：
From Dutch *dopen "to dip, immerse," related to doppen "to dip, dunk," of uncertain origin.  Originally referred to dipping or immersing something in a liquid.  Later came to refer to the addition of impurities to a substance, and in the 20th century acquired the meaning of administering performance-enhancing drugs.
