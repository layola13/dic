The word "dispansion" is not a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  It might be intended as a variant of "dispensation," "expansion," or perhaps even "dispersion."  Therefore, I'll analyze "dispensation" as it's the closest recognized word.

dispensation:/ˌdɪspənˈseɪʃən/ | n. | 分配; 免除; 特许; (尤指宗教方面的) 特殊许可 |  The act of distributing or dealing out something. An exemption from a rule or usual requirement. | The priest asked the Pope for a special dispensation to marry them.  神父请求教皇给予他们结婚的特许。 |  distribution, allocation, exemption, immunity | restriction, obligation | noun
