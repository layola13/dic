ETYMOLOGY->
From be- + grudge + -er.  "Be-" is a prefix meaning "thoroughly," and "grudge" comes from Old French "groucier" meaning "to murmur, grumble, complain." The suffix "-er" forms agent nouns.  Therefore, a begrudger is someone who thoroughly grumbles or complains about the good fortune of others.
