词源:  "be" + "mad".  "mad" comes from Old English *gemæded "made mad, insane," past participle of *gemædan "to make mad," from Proto-Germanic *ga-maidjanan "to change, alter" (source also of Old Norse meida "to hurt, injure," Gothic gamaidjan "to change"). The original sense was "crippled, disabled."  "Be" is from Old English beon "to be, exist, happen, become."
