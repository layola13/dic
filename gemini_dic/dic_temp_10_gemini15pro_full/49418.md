词源:

Dellie is likely a shortened, informal version of "delicious," implying an attractive and desirable woman. It may also be influenced by "Delilah," a biblical figure known for her beauty and seductive power.  Its usage as a term for "prostitute" likely stems from the association of attractiveness with the sex trade.
