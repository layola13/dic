climate:/ˈklaɪmət/ | n. | 气候，氛围，风气，思潮 |  From Old French climat or directly from Latin clīma "region, slope, zone of the earth," from Greek klíma "inclination, slope, zone," literally "sloping surface of the earth," from klinein "to slope, to lean."  The Greek word originally referred to the supposed slope of the earth from the equator toward the poles and hence to a region of the earth between two given parallels of latitude. The sense evolution from "zone" to "prevailing weather conditions in a zone" is evident from the 14c. |例句：The climate in the mountains is very cold. 山区的气候很冷。| The social climate of the country is changing rapidly.  这个国家的社会风气正在迅速变化。 | 近义词：atmosphere, weather, environment | 反义词:  N/A | 名词
