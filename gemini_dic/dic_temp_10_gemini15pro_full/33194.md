chromoplastid:/ˈkroʊməˌplæstɪd/ | n. | 色素体；杂色体 | A plastid containing pigments other than chlorophyll, typically yellow or orange carotenoids.  These pigments may be synthesized de novo or be derived from chloroplasts during senescence or fruit ripening. |  The bright colors of many flowers and fruits are due to pigments in chromoplasts. 许多花朵和水果鲜艳的颜色是由于色素体中的色素造成的。|Synonyms: plastid, chromatophore | Antonyms: chloroplast, leucoplast | noun
