He has been struggling with a non-defined error message all day. = 他一整天都在与未定义的错误消息作斗争。



一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program crashed because a variable was non-defined. = 程序崩溃是因为一个变量未定义。
The error message indicated a non-defined function call. = 错误消息指示未定义的函数调用。


过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
I was trying to compile the code when I encountered the non-defined variable error. = 我试图编译代码时遇到了未定义的变量错误。
He was debugging the program when he discovered the non-defined function. = 他在调试程序时发现了未定义的函数。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
Before the bug was fixed, the function had been non-defined. = 在修复错误之前，该函数一直未定义。
The program had crashed several times due to non-defined variables before the issue was resolved. = 在问题解决之前，程序由于未定义的变量崩溃了好几次。


过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The developers had been trying to identify the non-defined function for days before they found the root cause. = 开发人员在找到根本原因之前，一直在尝试识别未定义的函数好几天。
We had been dealing with non-defined errors for weeks before we finally solved the problem. = 在我们最终解决问题之前，我们已经处理了数周的未定义错误。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
If you don't initialize the variable, it will be non-defined. = 如果不初始化变量，它将未定义。
The program will crash if the function remains non-defined. = 如果函数保持未定义，程序将崩溃。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
Tomorrow, the team will be investigating the cause of the non-defined behavior. = 明天，团队将调查未定义行为的原因。
They will be working on fixing the non-defined variable issue next week. = 下周他们将致力于修复未定义的变量问题。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of the week, we will have resolved the non-defined error. = 到本周末，我们将解决未定义的错误。
By next month, the developers will have implemented a solution for the non-defined function. = 到下个月，开发人员将实现未定义函数的解决方案。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
By next year, we will have been using this non-defined function without issue. = 到明年，我们将一直使用这个未定义的函数而不会出现问题。（注意：这句例句语义略奇怪，因为通常不会长期使用未定义的函数）
By the time the project is finished, they will have been working on resolving this non-defined behavior for months. = 到项目完成时，他们将已经为解决这种未定义的行为工作了几个月。
