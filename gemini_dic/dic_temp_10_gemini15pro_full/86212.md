词源:
From Middle English *hethenly*, from Old English *hæðenlīċe*, equivalent to *hæðen* (“heathen”) + *-līċe* (adverbial suffix). Cognate with Dutch *hedenlijk*, German *heidnisch*.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun "heathen" (meaning a person who does not belong to a widely held religion) into an adjective or adverb describing something related to or characteristic of heathens.
