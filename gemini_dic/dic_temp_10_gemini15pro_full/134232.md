noninertial:/ˌnɒnɪˈnɜːʃəl/ | adj. | 非惯性的 |  Not inertial; experiencing or exhibiting acceleration.  A noninertial frame of reference is one that is accelerating with respect to an inertial frame. |  The Coriolis force is an apparent force that arises in a rotating, noninertial frame of reference. 科里奥利力是一种在旋转的非惯性参照系中出现的视力。

The motion of objects within a noninertial frame, like a car accelerating around a curve, cannot be explained by Newton's laws of motion without invoking fictitious forces. 在非惯性系（例如绕曲线加速的汽车）中，物体的运动无法用牛顿运动定律来解释，除非引入虚拟力。 | Near synonyms: accelerated, non-uniform | Antonym: inertial | word type: adjective
