注意事项:

"Avail yourselves of" is a rather formal and somewhat archaic expression.  While grammatically correct, it sounds stilted in modern English. Using simpler alternatives like "use," "take advantage of," or "benefit from" is generally recommended.  The reflexive pronoun "yourselves" indicates a plural subject.  The singular form is "avail yourself of."
