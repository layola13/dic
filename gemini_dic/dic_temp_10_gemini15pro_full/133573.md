PHRASE->
(Since "nonflagrantly" is an adverb describing the manner of an action, it doesn't readily form set phrases.  It modifies verbs.  Therefore, instead of phrases, I'll provide examples of how it can be used with different verbs.)

1.  act nonflagrantly  行事不张扬
2.  protest nonflagrantly  不公然抗议
3.  disagree nonflagrantly  不显著地反对
4.  violate nonflagrantly  不公然违反
5.  express nonflagrantly  不显著地表达


词源:  "Non-" (Latin prefix meaning "not") + "flagrant" (from Latin "flagrans," present participle of "flagrare" - to burn, blaze) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  Therefore, it literally means "not blazingly" or "not obviously."
