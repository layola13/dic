antisymmetries:/ˌæntiˈsɪmətriz/| n. | 反对称性，反对称 |  The plural of antisymmetry, referring to the properties or instances of something being antisymmetric.  Antisymmetry is a property of a relation where if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in the relation, then a = b.  This is often seen in mathematics and physics. | The mathematical model exhibited several antisymmetries, which helped simplify the calculations.  These antisymmetries are crucial for understanding the behavior of the system. | 近义词:asymmetries (in some contexts) | 反义词:symmetries | 词性:名词
