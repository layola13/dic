词源:  From Old French *flagrance, from Latin fragrantia (“sweet smell, fragrance”), from fragrans, present participle of fragrare (“to emit a sweet smell”), from fragum (“strawberry”) + -are (frequentative suffix).  The semantic shift from "sweet smell" to "bad smell" and then to "notorious badness" is unusual.
