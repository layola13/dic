词源: From French *brume*, from Old French *bruma*, from Late Latin *bruma* "winter solstice, shortest day of the year, winter; mist, fog".  The original sense of "winter" is preserved in the related word *brumal*.  The sense shift to "mist, fog" likely arose from the association of winter with misty, foggy weather.
