ETYMOLOGY->
From advice + -ful.  "Advice" comes from Old French "avis". "-ful" is a suffix meaning "full of" or "characterized by".

USAGE->
This word is considered archaic or obsolete and rarely used in modern English.  It's more common to use phrases like "full of advice," "eager to give advice," or "prone to offering advice."

However, if used, it would follow standard adjective usage.
