词源：
"Boobs" likely originated as a euphemism or childish term for breasts, possibly influenced by their rounded shape. Its etymology is somewhat unclear, but it's considered a relatively recent slang term.  "Boob" meaning "fool" comes from the earlier "booby," referring to a type of seabird known for its clumsiness on land. This sense of "booby" was then extended metaphorically to foolish or naive people.


注意事项：
"Boobs" is considered informal and potentially offensive. Use with caution, especially in formal settings.  It's generally more appropriate among close friends or in casual conversations.
