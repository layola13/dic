词源:
"over-" (prefix) + "affectionate" (adjective)

"over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, beyond, across."  It indicates an excess or surpassing of a limit.

"affectionate" comes from the Latin "affectus" (past participle of "afficere," meaning "to do something to, to influence"), which in turn comes from "ad-" (to) + "facere" (to do, to make).
