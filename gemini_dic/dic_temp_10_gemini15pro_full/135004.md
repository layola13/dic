nonnegations:/ˌnɒnɪˈɡeɪʃənz/ | n. |非否定; 非否定式|The set of nonnegations includes all positive numbers and zero.  非否定集包括所有正数和零。| This theorem deals with nonnegations of real numbers.  这个定理处理的是实数的非否定式。 | 近义词: nonnegative values, positive values (sometimes)| 反义词: negations | 词性: 名词 (plural)


nonnegation:/ˌnɒnɪˈɡeɪʃən/ | n. |非否定; 非否定式|The nonnegation of a number is its absolute value. 一个数的非否定是它的绝对值。|  Ensuring the nonnegation of the variables is crucial in this optimization problem. 确保变量的非否定性在这个优化问题中至关重要。| 近义词: nonnegative value, positive value (sometimes)| 反义词: negation | 词性: 名词


词源:  "Nonnegation" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "negation" (the act of denying or contradicting). "Negation" itself comes from the Latin word "negatio," meaning "denial."
