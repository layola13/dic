注意事项:
Though etymologically linked to Russia and Russians, the word "brusso" is not commonly used in modern English to refer to Russia or Russians. Its primary meaning remains related to rudeness or a rough manner. Using it to refer to a Russian person is often considered outdated and potentially offensive.
