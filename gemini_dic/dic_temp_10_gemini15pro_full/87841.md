ETYMOLOGY->
"hide-and-go-seek" is a compound word. "Hide" comes from Old English "hȳdan," meaning "to conceal." "Seek" comes from Old English "sēcan," meaning "to search for."  The "and-go" element likely evolved from similar games and emphasizes the action of seeking.  The term became common in the 18th century.
