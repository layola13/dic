词性: 名词 (Noun)

词源:  "Overliking's" is derived from the verb "overlike" + possessive suffix 's. "Overlike" itself is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and the verb "like" (meaning "to find agreeable or enjoyable").  The suffix -'s indicates possession, in this case, likely referring to the consequences or manifestations of overliking.
