The iodine vapor desublimates on the cool surface of the flask. 碘蒸气在烧瓶的冷却表面凝华。
近义词: deposits, condenses, crystallizes
反义词: sublimates, evaporates
词性: v.


ETYMOLOGY->
From de- (prefix meaning "reverse" or "remove") + sublimate (verb meaning "to change from a solid to a gas without becoming liquid").  The "sub-" in "sublimate" comes from Latin "sub" (meaning "under" or "up from below") + "limen" (meaning "threshold").  Thus, "desublimate" literally means to reverse the process of going from a solid state directly to a gas state.
