词源:  "Clapcake" is likely a colloquial or regional term, and its exact origin is unclear.  "Clap" might refer to the simple, quick way the ingredients are combined, or perhaps to the flat, hand-sized shape of the cakes. "Cake" denotes the baked good itself. It doesn't appear in major dictionaries, suggesting it's not a standardized term.
