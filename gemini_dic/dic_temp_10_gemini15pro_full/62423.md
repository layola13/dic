endomorphy:/ˈɛndəˌmɔːrfi/| n. |内胚层体型，肥胖体型|A body type characterized by a predominance of soft roundness throughout the regions of the body, including a rounded abdomen, relatively short limbs, and soft, smooth skin.  It is associated with a tendency to gain weight easily. |Example 1:  Studies suggest a correlation between endomorphy and an increased risk of certain health issues. 研究表明内胚层体型与某些健康问题的风险增加之间存在相关性。

Example 2:  His endomorphy made it difficult for him to excel in sports that required agility and speed. 他的肥胖体型使他难以在需要敏捷和速度的运动中脱颖而出。|Synonym:  mesomorphy (partially, as it relates to body type), obesity (relates to excess weight), stockiness|Antonym: ectomorphy, leanness|noun
