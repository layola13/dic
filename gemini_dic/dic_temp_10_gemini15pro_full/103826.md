PHRASE->
(Joyed is not typically used in set phrases.  It’s more commonly used on its own as a descriptive adjective.)


注意事项:

"-ed" endings can sometimes be pronounced as /ɪd/ after /t/ or /d/ sounds. However, in "joyed", the pronunciation is /dʒɔɪd/ because the preceding sound is /dʒ/.


The continuous tenses with "joyed" (being joyed) are less common and can sound slightly awkward.  It's more natural to use the simple tenses in most cases.
