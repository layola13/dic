词源:  "Overvault" is a relatively new word formed by combining "over," meaning "excessive" or "beyond," with "vault," referencing a secure storage space.  The usage related to exaggeration likely stems from the idea of placing something in a vault more secure than necessary, implying an inflated sense of importance.
