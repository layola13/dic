overmagnetic:/ˌoʊvərˌmægˈnɛtɪk/| adj.|过磁化的，磁性过强的|Having excessive magnetic properties; excessively magnetized.|The overmagnetic field interfered with the delicate sensors. 过强的磁场干扰了精密传感器。|近义词：hypermagnetic|反义词：undermagnetic|词性:形容词

Etymology:
"over-" (Old English *ofer, from Proto-Germanic *ubir "over, above") + "magnetic" (from Late Latin magneticus, from Greek magnētikos "magnetic," from Magnēsía, a district in Thessaly, Greece, where magnetite was found).
