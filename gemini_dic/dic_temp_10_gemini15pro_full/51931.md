词源:  From Latin *diabētēs, from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabḗtēs, “siphon”), from διαβαίνειν (diabaínein, “to stride across, pass through”), from διά (diá, “through”) + βαίνειν (baínein, “to go”). + insipidus from Latin in- (“not”) + sapidus (“tasty, savory”).  So literally, "passing through without flavor," referring to the dilute and tasteless urine characteristic of the condition.
