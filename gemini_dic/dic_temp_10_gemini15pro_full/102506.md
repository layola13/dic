注意事项:
Since "Jacobs" is primarily used as a proper noun (surname or brand name), many grammatical constructions are less common than if it were a common noun.  For example, pluralizing "Jacobs" to "Jacobses" is rare and would likely only occur in a context like "The Jacobses are a large family."  Similarly, using "Jacobs" as the object of a verb (e.g., "I saw Jacobs") is less common than using it as the subject (e.g., "Jacobs saw me").
