词源:  From Old French enemis (plural), nominative plural of enemi "enemy, foe, adversary," from Latin inimicus "private foe, personal enemy" (as opposed to hostis "public enemy"), from in- "not" (see in- (1)) + amicus "friend, loved, dear" (see Amy).


注意事项:  While "emies" is grammatically incorrect, it can sometimes be encountered in informal writing or due to typos.  The correct plural of "enemy" is "enemies."
