endosporous:/ɛnˈdɒspərəs/ | adj. | 内生孢子的，产生内生孢子的 | Producing or containing endospores, which are resistant, dormant structures formed by some bacteria. |  Bacillus and Clostridium are examples of endosporous bacteria.  芽孢杆菌和梭状芽孢杆菌是内生孢子细菌的例子。 |  近义词: spore-forming, sporogenous | 反义词: asporogenous | 词性: adjective

Etymology:  From endo- (within) + -sporous (spore-bearing).  源自 endo- (内部) + -sporous (孢子承载的).
