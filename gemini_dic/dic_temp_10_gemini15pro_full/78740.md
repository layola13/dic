gigo:/ˈɡɪɡoʊ/| n.|垃圾进，垃圾出(Garbage In, Garbage Out)|A computing term that means that inaccurate or poor quality input will produce inaccurate or poor quality output.  If the data going into a computer system is flawed, the output will also be flawed. |例句：The gigo principle applies to all kinds of information processing, not just computer systems. 垃圾进，垃圾出原则适用于所有类型的信息处理，而不仅仅是计算机系统。

例句：The financial projections were completely wrong because of gigo – the initial assumptions were flawed.  由于垃圾进，垃圾出，财务预测完全错误——最初的假设就有缺陷。|近义词：rubbish in, rubbish out; bad data in, bad data out|反义词: quality in, quality out|词性:noun
