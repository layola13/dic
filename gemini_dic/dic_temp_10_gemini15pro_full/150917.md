parallelization:/ˌpærəˌləlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 并行化，平行化 | The process of designing or structuring something (e.g., a computer program or a task) so that it can be divided into multiple parts that can be executed simultaneously, thus increasing efficiency and speed. |  Modern computers rely heavily on parallelization to perform complex calculations quickly. 现代计算机严重依赖并行化来快速执行复杂的计算。

The parallelization of the software significantly reduced processing time.  该软件的并行化显著减少了处理时间。 | 近义词: concurrency, parallelism | 反义词: serialization, sequentialization | 词性: noun

Etymology: From parallel + -ization.  "Parallel" comes from the Greek "parallelos" meaning "beside one another." "-ization" is a suffix used to form nouns denoting an action or process.
