cyclobranchiate: /ˌsaɪkləʊˈbræŋkiət/ | adj. | 环鳃的 | Having gills arranged in a circle.  |  Example: Cyclobranchiate gastropods are often found in tidal pools. 环鳃腹足动物经常在潮汐池中被发现。 | Example: The cyclobranchiate anatomy of the limpet allows it to cling tightly to rocks. 帽贝的环鳃结构使其能够紧紧地附着在岩石上。 | Synonym: circumbranchiate | Antonym: (No direct antonym, as it's a specific anatomical description) | adjective

Etymology:
From cyclo- + branchiate.  "Cyclo-" comes from the Greek "kuklos" meaning "circle" or "wheel". "Branchiate" comes from the Latin "branchiae" meaning "gills".
