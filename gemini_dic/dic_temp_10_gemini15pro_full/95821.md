noun
公司法人资格（复数）
The state of being incorporated, especially multiple instances of incorporation. This word refers to the legal status of businesses that have been formed as corporations. It's rarely used due to its awkwardness.  It emphasizes the multiple instances of incorporation, perhaps referring to different subsidiaries or companies within a larger conglomerate.
Due to the awkwardness and rarity of this word, constructing natural-sounding examples is difficult.  Here's a contrived example to illustrate the potential meaning: "The lawyer specialized in understanding the complexities of incorporatednesses within multinational conglomerates."
