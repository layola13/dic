endorsingly:/ɪnˈdɔːrsɪŋli/
adverb
赞同地，认可地
in a manner that expresses approval or support.
He smiled endorsingly at her suggestion. 他赞许地对她提出的建议笑了笑。
近义词: approvingly, supportively, favorably
反义词: disapprovingly, critically, negatively
词性: adverb

词源:  Derived from the verb "endorse," which comes from Old French "endoser" (to write on the back of), from "en-" (on) + "dos" (back), from Latin "dorsum."  The "-ing" suffix creates the present participle, and the "-ly" suffix transforms it into an adverb.
