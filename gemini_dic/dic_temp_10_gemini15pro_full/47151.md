davyum:/ˈdeɪviəm/ | n. | 钅达 |A hypothetical chemical element proposed by Henry Moseley but never discovered.  It was predicted to have an atomic number of 43. This element is now known as technetium. |  Moseley predicted the existence of davyum, which would fill a gap in the periodic table.  莫斯利预言了钅达的存在，它将填补元素周期表中的一个空白。| Near synonyms:  eka-manganese (an older name for the predicted element) | Antonyms: N/A | noun
