gossan:/ˈɡɒsən/ | n. | 铁帽， Gossan |  A usually reddish, oxidized, weathered zone or cap of a sulfide ore deposit. It is formed by the oxidation of sulfides to oxides, hydroxides, and sulfates, often accompanied by the leaching of the more soluble components, leaving a porous mass enriched in iron oxides. | The presence of gossan can be a good indicator of underlying sulfide ore deposits. | synonyms: iron hat, caprock, | antonyms: ore | noun
