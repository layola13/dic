aurae's:/ˈɔːreɪz/
noun
灵气的，光环的 (复数属格)
The possessive form of "aurae," meaning belonging to or associated with auras. Aurae refers to the emanations or subtle atmosphere surrounding a person, place, or thing.  Aurae's itself is not commonly used.  The singular possessive, "aura's," is far more frequent.
The aurae's brilliance captivated the onlookers. (This usage is grammatically correct, but sounds unnatural.  "The brilliance of the aurae captivated the onlookers" or "The auras' brilliance..." would be better.)
近义词: emanations', atmospheres'
反义词: (No direct antonym for a possessive form)
