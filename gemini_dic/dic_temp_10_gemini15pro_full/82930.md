词源:
Likely from the now dialectal or obsolete *gump*, meaning "a clumsy or stupid person," perhaps of imitative origin. The sense evolution from "clumsy person" to "sulky mood" is not entirely clear, but may be related to the perceived sullenness or withdrawal of someone feeling awkward or foolish.  It is primarily found in Scottish and Northern English dialects.
