词源：available + -ness

"Availableness" is grammatically correct, but "availability" is much more commonly used and preferred.  While "availablenesses" is grammatically possible as the plural of "availableness," it is very awkward and rarely used.  Using the plural of "availability" - "availabilities" - is much more natural and recommended when referring to multiple instances of availability.
