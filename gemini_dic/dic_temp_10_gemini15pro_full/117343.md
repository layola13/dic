词源： "Mediacies" is derived from "media" (plural of "medium"), with the suffix "-acies" added to indicate a state or condition.  "Media" itself comes from the Latin "medium," meaning "middle" or "means."  The suffix "-acies" is related to "-acy," which forms nouns denoting a state, condition, or quality.
