contrafissure:/ˌkɒntrəˈfɪʃə(r)/ /ˌkɑːntrəˈfɪʃər/ | n. | 对侧裂, 反裂 | A fissure or crack in a rock, opposite to the side on which a blow was struck; a fracture produced by "counter-stroke," or indirect violence.  It is a fracture or crack in a bone on the side opposite to where the blow was received. | The doctor identified a contrafissure on the skull, indicating the point of impact was on the opposite side. 医生在头骨上发现了一个对侧裂，表明撞击点在另一侧。

The contrafissure in the rock face suggested the pressure came from the opposite direction. 岩壁上的反裂表明压力来自相反的方向。 | synonyms: counter-fissure, indirect fracture | antonyms: direct fracture | noun
