ETYMOLOGY->
"off" (adv., prep.) Old English "of," from Proto-Germanic "*af" (source also of Old Norse "af," Old Frisian "of," Dutch "af," German "ab"), from PIE root "*apo" (source also of Sanskrit "apa," Greek "apo," Latin "ab," Old Church Slavonic "otŭ," Lithuanian "nuo").  The meaning shifted from "away from" to also include "not on" or "detached from."

"ground" (n.) Old English "grund," from Proto-Germanic "*grunduz" (source also of Old Saxon, Old Norse, Old Frisian "grund," Dutch "grond," German "Grund"), from PIE root "*ghrē-" (2) "to grow, green" (source also of Old English "grōwan" "to grow").  The meaning in "off the ground" refers to the literal ground or surface, implying something has been lifted or started.
