PHRASE->
Not applicable.  "Noninstrumentally" is rarely used in set phrases.  It's a more formal and less common word.


词源:  "Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "instrumental" (adjective meaning "serving as an instrument or means") + "-ly" (adverb suffix).  Ultimately from Latin "instrumentum" (tool, implement).
