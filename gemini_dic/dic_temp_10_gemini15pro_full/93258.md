PHRASE->
(Since "ilad" is archaic, phrases are difficult to construct naturally.  Here are some using "glad" instead, which carries the same meaning)

Glad to meet you. = 很高兴认识你。
Glad to hear it. = 很高兴听到这个消息。
Glad to be of service. = 乐意效劳。
Glad you could make it. = 很高兴你能来。

注意事项:

"ilad" is an archaic word and is rarely used in modern English.  Using "glad" is preferred.
