词源: From Old French jeu parti "a divided game, game with even chances," from jeu "game" (from Latin jocus "joke, game") + parti "divided," past participle of partir "to divide" (from Latin partire). The original meaning was "to put (something) at stake in a game of chance."  来自古法语 jeu parti “一个平分的游戏，机会均等的游戏”，由 jeu “游戏”（来自拉丁语 jocus “笑话，游戏”）+ parti “分开的”，partir 的过去分词“分开”（来自拉丁语 partire）。最初的意思是“在机会游戏中将（某物）置于危险之中”。
