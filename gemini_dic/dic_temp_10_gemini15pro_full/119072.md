注意事项:
Since "metosa" is a loanword from Finnish, there isn't a direct English equivalent with the same cultural connotations.  The closest translations are "cabin," "cottage," or "hut."  However, "metosa" specifically refers to a Finnish summer cottage.  This nuance is important for accurate usage and understanding.
