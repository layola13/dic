词源:
This idiom originated in the late 19th century in the United States.  At that time, a dime (10 cents) could buy a dozen of common items like eggs or apples.  Therefore, something "a dime a dozen" was considered plentiful and inexpensive.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the commonness and lack of value, regardless of the actual price.
