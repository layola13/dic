词源: "Conny" is a shortened, informal, and somewhat dated term for "rabbit," derived from "cony," which itself comes from the Old French "conin" or "connil," ultimately tracing back to the Latin "cuniculus." While "cony" is still occasionally used (though often in literary contexts), "conny" is now much less common.
