词源：From *ouster*, from *oust* (verb).  *Oust* comes from Old French *oster*, meaning "to remove, take away".  Ultimately from Latin *obstare* "to stand before, oppose, obstruct," from *ob* "against" + *stare* "to stand." The sense evolution likely involved the idea of removing someone by standing in their way or opposing them.
