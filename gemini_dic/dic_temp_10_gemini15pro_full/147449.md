ETYMOLOGY->

From over- + obsequiousness.  "Obsequious" comes from the Latin obsequiosus "compliant, obedient," from obsequi "to comply with, yield to," from ob- "toward" + sequi "to follow."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "obsequious" into the noun "obsequiousness."  "Over-" simply intensifies the meaning to indicate an excess.
