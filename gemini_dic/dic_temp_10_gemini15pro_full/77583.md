gedd:/ɡɛd/ | n. |鲫鱼| A small freshwater fish, typically bottom-dwelling, of the carp family. |  He caught a gedd while fishing in the lake. 他在湖里钓鱼时钓到了一条鲫鱼。|  近义词: roach, dace | 反义词:  (No direct antonym for a specific fish) | 词性: 名词

词源: From Middle English *gedde, from Old Norse gedda (“pike”), from Proto-Germanic *gaddǭ (“pike”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰadʰ- (“to seize, sting”).  Originally referred to pike, but meaning shifted in some dialects to refer to other similar fish like roach and dace, eventually settling on its current meaning of a specific type of small carp.
