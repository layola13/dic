PHRASE->
(Since "hammed" is a less common word and primarily a past participle,  common phrases are not readily available.  Instead, I'll provide phrases using "hammer" which are more relevant.)

hammer out a deal 达成协议
hammer home a point  强调一个观点
hammer away at something 坚持不懈地做某事
hammer into someone's head  反复灌输
go at it hammer and tongs 全力以赴


注意事项:  As noted, "hammed" is less frequently used than "hammered."  While grammatically correct in all tenses, its usage might sound somewhat unusual in certain contexts.  "Hammered" is generally preferred.
