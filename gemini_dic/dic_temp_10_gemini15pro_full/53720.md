词源：  "disclout" is a relatively recent coinage formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "lack of") to the noun "clout" (meaning "influence" or "power").  While "clout" has a long history, dating back to Middle English, "disclout" is less common and doesn't appear in most dictionaries. However, it is a readily understandable formation based on standard English morphology.
