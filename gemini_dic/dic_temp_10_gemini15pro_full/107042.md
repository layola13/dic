lactonic:/lækˈtɒnɪk/
adjective
内酯的；含内酯的
Relating to or containing a lactone.
Lactones are cyclic esters formed from the intramolecular reaction of a carboxylic acid group with a hydroxyl group in the same molecule.  Lactonic compounds often contribute to the aroma of fruits and other natural products.
The lactonic ring is a key structural feature of many natural products.  内酯环是许多天然产物的关键结构特征。
The compound exhibited a distinct lactonic aroma.  该化合物展现出独特的内酯香气。
近义词:lactone-containing, cyclic ester (related concepts)
反义词: (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific chemical structure)
词性: adjective

词源: lactone (内酯) + -ic (形容词后缀)
The word "lactone" comes from lactic acid, which can form a lactone.  "Lactic" ultimately derives from the Latin "lac," meaning "milk."
