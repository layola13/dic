dislade:/dɪˈsleɪd/ | v. | 使脱离；使错位；使脱臼| To put out of its proper place; to dislocate. |The blow disladed his jaw. 那一击打脱了他的下巴。|近义词：dislocate, displace, luxate |反义词: locate, place, set |词性: 动词

词源: From dis- + lade "to load," from Old English *lād "way, course, journey" (related to lead (v.)). The original sense was "to put out of a regular course or customary place," hence "to unload." Later, by influence of dislocate, the current sense of "put a bone out of joint" emerged.
