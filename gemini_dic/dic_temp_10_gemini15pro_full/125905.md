From Late Latin *musculositas*, from Latin musculosus (“muscular”) + -itas (suffix forming abstract nouns of quality).  Musculosus is derived from musculus (“muscle”) (ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mūs (“mouse”) + -culus (diminutive suffix)) + -osus (adjective-forming suffix meaning “full of; abounding in”).
