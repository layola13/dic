词源: From Old English *dysig "foolish, silly," from Proto-Germanic *dusigaz (source also of Old Saxon disig, Old Frisian disich "foolish, out of one's wits," Middle Dutch dusech, Dutch duizig "dizzy, giddy," Old High German tusig "out of one's wits, insane," German dösig "dozy, drowsy"), from PIE root *dhwes- "to be confused, dazed." The meaning shifted from "foolish" to "dizzy" probably via a sense of "bewildered, confused."  The -ing suffix turns the adjective "dizzy" into the present participle form used as an adjective "dizzying."
