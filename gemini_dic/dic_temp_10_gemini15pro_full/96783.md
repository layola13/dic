词性: adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + equi- (equal) + valve + -ular (relating to).  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "equi-", indicating inequality. "Valve" refers to a flap or other structure that controls the flow of a fluid.  "-ular" creates an adjective relating to valves.  Therefore, "inequivalvular" describes something with unequal valves.
