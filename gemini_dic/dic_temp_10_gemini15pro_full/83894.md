注意事项:

*  `half-arsed` is considered vulgar slang and should be avoided in formal settings.  `half-assed` is the more common spelling in American English.

词源：half + arse(d) / ass(ed).  "Arse" is British English for "buttocks," and "ass" is the American English equivalent.  The term implies something is done only halfway, or with the buttocks, suggesting a lack of effort or care.
