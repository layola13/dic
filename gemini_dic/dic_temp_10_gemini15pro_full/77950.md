genotypicity:/ˌdʒiːnoʊtaɪˈpɪsɪti/ | n. |基因型性，基因型纯度|The genotypicity of the strain was confirmed by sequencing. |  The study examined the genotypicity of the samples to ensure they were representative of the population. | 近义词: genotype purity, genetic homogeneity | 反义词: genetic heterogeneity, genotypic variation | 词性: noun

词源:  From "genotype" + "-icity" (a suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  "Genotype" itself comes from "geno-" (from Greek *genos* meaning "race, kind") + "-type" (from Greek *typos* meaning "impression, mark, type").
