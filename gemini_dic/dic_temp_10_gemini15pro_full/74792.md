注意事项:

词源： From Spanish *frejol*, diminutive of *fréjol* (“bean”), from Old Spanish *frisol*, *fesol*, *fajol*, from Vulgar Latin *phaseolus*, from Latin *phaseolus* (“kidney bean”).


Since *frejol* is primarily used in spoken Latin American Spanish, it doesn't have a strict set of antonyms.  The opposite concept would depend on the context. For example, if talking about a staple food, the opposite could be "luxury food" or a specific food item not commonly eaten in the region.
