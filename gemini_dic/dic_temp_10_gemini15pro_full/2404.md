ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *adjectionalis, from Latin adjectus (past participle of adicere "to add to"), from ad- "to" + jacere "to throw".  Ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ye- "to throw, impel".

USAGE->
This word is not commonly used in modern English.  It's more common to use "attributive" or simply "adjective" when referring to the function of an adjective.  Therefore, providing usage examples for different tenses and grammatical structures would be misleading and inaccurate.  Instead, I will provide examples demonstrating how to describe the *use* of adjectives, which is more practical.

Describing the use of adjectives:

The author uses vivid adjectival language to paint a picture of the scene. = 作者用生动的形容词语言描绘了场景。

His speech was filled with powerful adjectives that stirred the audience. = 他的演讲充满了震撼人心的有力形容词。

PHRASE->
"Adjectional phrase" is the most common phrase associated with this word.  Other phrases are not commonly used.
adjectional phrase = 形容词短语
adjectional modification =  形容词修饰

注意事项:
While "adjectional" is a valid word, it's less common than "adjectival".  Consider using "adjectival" instead in most cases.
