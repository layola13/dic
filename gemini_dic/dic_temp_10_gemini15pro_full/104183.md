词源:
From Middle French *jonquette "rush basket," from Old French jonc "rush," from Latin juncus. Originally referred to a basket made of rushes used for carrying cheese, later to the cheese itself (a type of curd cheese), and finally to a feast or banquet, perhaps originally featuring such cheese. The sense of a pleasure trip, especially one taken at public expense, developed in the 19th century.
