heteroscedastic:/ˌhɛtərəʊskəˈdæstɪk/ | adj. | 异方差的 |  Exhibiting heteroscedasticity; having different variability.  It describes a situation in statistics where the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it. | The researchers found that the data was heteroscedastic, violating the assumptions of linear regression. 研究人员发现数据是异方差的，违反了线性回归的假设。

The model's predictions were less accurate due to the heteroscedastic nature of the errors. 由于误差的异方差性，模型的预测不太准确。| Near Synonyms: nonconstant variance, unequal variance | Antonyms: homoscedastic, constant variance| adjective
