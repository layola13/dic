diseasednesses:/dɪˈziːzdnɪsɪz/ | n. | 病态，疾病状态（罕用）|  A state of being diseased; the condition of having multiple diseases or a high degree of illness.  This word is considered non-standard and rarely used.  It's formed by adding multiple suffixes to "disease" which is grammatically unconventional. |  While grammatically possible, "diseasednesses" is not a standard English word and you'd be unlikely to find it used in formal writing or common speech. Constructing a natural-sounding example is difficult due to its awkwardness. A contrived example could be: "The diseasednesses of the plants were evident in their wilting leaves." 植物的病态表现在它们的叶子枯萎上. |Near Synonyms: illnesses, sicknesses, morbidities | Antonyms: health, wellness | Noun
