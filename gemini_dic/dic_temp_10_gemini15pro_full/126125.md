mutexes:/ˈmjuːtɛksiːz/| n.|互斥体|A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to protect shared resources from simultaneous access by multiple threads or processes.  It acts like a lock, allowing only one thread to hold it at a time.|The program uses mutexes to prevent data corruption when multiple threads access the shared memory. 该程序使用互斥体来防止多线程访问共享内存时的数据损坏。|近义词：locks, semaphores|反义词:N/A|名词
