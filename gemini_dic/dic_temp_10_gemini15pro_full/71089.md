ETYMOLOGY->
fish (n.) from Old English "fisc," from Proto-Germanic *fiskaz.
farm (v.) from Old English "feormian" meaning "to supply with food, provision," from "feorm" meaning "provisions, food, sustenance."  Originally, a farm was land rented in exchange for provisions.  The sense shifted to the land itself being the primary focus, with the provision of food being a result of working the land.
-ed (suffix) indicates that the fish has undergone the process of being farmed.
