  "definition": "Cesiums is the plural form of 'cesium', a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with the chemical symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is widely used in scientific applications, such as atomic clocks and various forms of spectroscopy. (Note: In most contexts, the element is referred to in the singular as 'cesium', but 'cesiums' may be used when referring to different samples, compounds, or isotopes.)",
  "example": "The cesiums in the laboratory sample were analyzed to determine their isotopic composition.",
