  "definition": "The term \"benen\" is not widely recognized in standard English and appears rarely in literature. In some contexts, it is used colloquially or dialectally—possibly influenced by other languages such as Dutch, where 'benen' means 'legs'. As a noun, it may refer to legs or limbs; as a verb, it is sometimes encountered in creative or poetic expressions suggesting to energize or reinforce one’s stance. Overall, the usage is very limited and nonstandard.",
