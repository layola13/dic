  "definition": "The term \"casting's\" can be interpreted in two main ways. In one sense, it is a contraction of \"casting is,\" used informally to indicate that the process of casting (in the context of selecting actors for a production or even a process such as metal casting) is currently in a certain state or condition. In another sense, it is the possessive form of the noun \"casting,\" referring to something belonging to or characteristic of the casting—for example, the quality or style associated with the selection of actors.",
  "example": "Casting's shaping up to be one of the best ensembles this season. \n(这里既可理解为 ‘casting is shaping up...’ 表示选角过程正在形成，也可理解为‘the casting's quality’, 即选角的品质。)",
