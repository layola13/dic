  "translation": "鲍文石",
  "definition": "Bowenite is a metamorphic rock belonging to the serpentine group. It is typically formed by the alteration of ultramafic rocks such as peridotite or dunite, displaying a light green, fibrous to massive texture. This mineral is often studied in geology for insights into metamorphic processes and is sometimes used as an ornamental stone.",
  "example": "The geologist examined a bowenite sample to investigate the metamorphic history of the region.",
