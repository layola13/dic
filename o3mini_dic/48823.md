  "definition": "The term 'defoedation' is not found in major English dictionaries. It may be a misspelling of 'defoliation', which refers to the process of removing leaves from trees or plants—whether due to natural causes (such as seasonal change or disease) or anthropogenic factors (such as deforestation practices). In some contexts, it might also be used as a neologism with a meaning related to dramatic change or depletion, but such usage is not yet standardized.",
