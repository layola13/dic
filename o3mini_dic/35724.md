  "definition": "A coccolith is a microscopic calcite plate produced by single-celled algae called coccolithophores. These plates form part of the algae’s outer covering and play a crucial role in light reflection, protection, and the formation of marine sediments that, over geological time, can contribute to chalk deposits.",
  "example": "The ancient ocean floor was covered with layers of coccoliths that eventually formed extensive chalk deposits.",
