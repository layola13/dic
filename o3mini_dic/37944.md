  "definition": "A complexant is a substance that forms a complex with another compound or ion, often used in chemical processes to sequester or modify the reactivity of metal ions. In many applications, particularly in coordination chemistry, complexants (often referred to as chelators or complexing agents) help stabilize metal ions in solution.",
  "example": "The complexant was added to the solution to bind the free metal ions and prevent precipitation.",
