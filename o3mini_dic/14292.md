  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "自运动的；自动运动的",
  "definition": "Pertaining to the phenomenon where a stationary point of light appears to move on its own, typically under dark or featureless conditions. This effect is known as the autokinetic effect, and the term is used to describe observations or objects that exhibit such self-initiated motion.",
  "example": "In a dark room, a small point of light can seem autokinetic, drifting slowly across the wall even though no physical movement occurs.",
