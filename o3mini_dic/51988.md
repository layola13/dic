  "definition": "Diageotropism is a phenomenon in plant physiology where certain plant organs grow in an oblique direction relative to the gravitational pull. This atypical growth response, differing from typical positive or negative geotropism, results from a combination of gravitational and other environmental stimuli.",
  "example": "The diageotropism observed in the climbing vine helps it twist around nearby structures for support.",
