  "definition": "In chemistry, backbond refers to a bonding interaction in which electrons are donated from a metal center (or another electron-rich atom) into an antibonding orbital of a ligand, thereby strengthening the overall bond. This phenomenon is commonly observed in coordination compounds, particularly those involving carbonyl or phosphine ligands.",
  "example": "The metal complex exhibits significant backbond properties, which enhances its stability.",
