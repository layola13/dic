  "definition": "Alcyonaria refers to a group of marine cnidarians commonly known as soft corals. These organisms, which are part of the subclass Octocorallia, typically exhibit eightfold symmetry and lack a rigid stony skeleton, unlike their hard coral counterparts. They play an important role in coral reef ecosystems by providing habitat complexity and contributing to marine biodiversity.",
