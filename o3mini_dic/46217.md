  "definition": "A cysticercus is the fluid-filled larval stage of certain tapeworms, typically found in the tissues of intermediate hosts such as pigs and, accidentally, humans. This developmental stage plays a key role in the lifecycle of the parasite and can lead to cysticercosis if it invades human tissues.",
  "example": "The doctor explained that the cysticercus discovered in the patient's brain was responsible for his neurological symptoms.",
