  "definition": "Cerulein is a decapeptide that acts similarly to cholecystokinin. It is commonly used in biomedical research to study pancreatic secretion and gastrointestinal motility. High doses of cerulein can induce hyperstimulation of the pancreas, which makes it a valuable agent in experimental models of acute pancreatitis.",
