  "translation": "通气组织",
  "definition": "Aerenchym (more commonly known as aerenchyma) refers to a specialized spongy tissue characterized by large intercellular air spaces. It is typically found in the roots, stems, and leaves of aquatic or waterlogged plants, facilitating the exchange and diffusion of gases, particularly oxygen, in environments with low oxygen availability.",
  "example": "The mangrove expanded its aerenchym within its roots to cope with anoxic soil conditions.",
