  "definition": "In digital signal processing and computer graphics, aliasing refers to the distortion or artifact that occurs when a signal or image is sampled at a rate that is insufficient to capture its changes accurately. In computer science, aliasing can also describe a situation where two different expressions refer to the same memory location.",
  "example": "The digital photograph suffered from aliasing, resulting in jagged edges along the curves. In programming, improper aliasing of pointers can lead to unexpected behaviors.",
