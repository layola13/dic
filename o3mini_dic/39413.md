  "definition": "In software design, connascence refers to a measure of the interdependence among various components. It indicates that two or more elements are so intrinsically linked that a change in one usually necessitates a corresponding change in the other. This concept is used to evaluate coupling within a system and often guides developers toward designs with low connascence to improve maintainability and modularity.",
  "example": "The legacy system suffered from high connascence, meaning that even minor modifications in one module required cascading changes elsewhere.",
