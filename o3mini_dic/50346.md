  "definition": "Depolarization refers to the process by which the normally polarized cell membrane (with a difference in charge across the membrane) loses its polarization, typically due to an influx of positive ions such as sodium. This process is crucial in initiating an action potential in nerve and muscle cells.",
  "example": "During an action potential, depolarization occurs as sodium ions rush into the neuron.",
