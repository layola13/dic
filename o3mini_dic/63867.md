  "definition": "In vertebrate anatomy, an epihyal is a component of the hyoid arch—commonly found in fishes and some amphibians—that supports the jaw and assists in feeding mechanics. As a structural element, it may be cartilaginous or ossified and plays a role in the evolution and functioning of the cranial skeleton.",
  "example": "Recent studies on teleost fishes have revealed that the epihyal varies considerably between species, offering insights into feeding adaptations.",
