  "definition": "1. (noun) A brancher refers to an entity—often a structure, device, or part of a system—that divides or extends into branches. It may describe a physical component (such as a part of a tree or an electronic device) that splits into multiple pathways. 2. (verb, rare) To brancher means to form branches or to diverge into several parts.",
  "example": "The engineering team installed a brancher to split the cable signal into several outputs.",
