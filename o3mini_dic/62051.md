  "definition": "Encapsulation is the process of enclosing or bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit. In computing, it restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. More generally, it refers to the act of enclosing something in a capsule or container.",
