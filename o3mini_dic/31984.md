  "definition": "Chemosmosis is the process by which ions and other molecules move across a semipermeable membrane, down a chemical concentration gradient. In biological systems, it typically refers to the movement of protons across membranes, such as in the mitochondria or chloroplasts, which drives the synthesis of ATP.",
  "example": "The inner mitochondrial membrane uses chemosmosis to generate ATP during cellular respiration.",
