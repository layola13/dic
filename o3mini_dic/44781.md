  "translation": "crunch 的；crunch 是（的缩写）",
  "definition": "This form of the word 'crunch' can function in two ways. It may serve as a contraction for 'crunch is' (or sometimes 'crunch has') in informal speech, or indicate the possessive form of the noun 'crunch'. As a noun, 'crunch' can refer to a noisy, crisp sound (often used to describe the sound of biting into something crunchy) or an exercise (commonly performed to strengthen abdominal muscles). When written as 'crunch's', the context determines whether it is a contracted verb phrase or a possessive marker indicating a characteristic or part of something related to 'crunch'.",
  "example": "Crunch's become a buzzword in the gym community, often referring both to the exercise and that satisfying sound when you bite into a crisp snack.",
