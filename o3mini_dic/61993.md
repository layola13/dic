  "definition": "A proposed clade of ancient, often marine-adapted reptiles that exhibited lizard-like features. Enaliosauria is used in paleontological contexts to refer to groups of reptiles whose fossil remains provide insight into the evolution of aquatic adaptations during the Mesozoic era. Although its taxonomic status has been debated, the term helps highlight evolutionary experiments in marine lifestyles among reptiles.",
