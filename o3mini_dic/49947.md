  "definition": "A dendrolite is a fossil or mineral formation that exhibits a branching, tree-like structure. It is typically formed through the mineralization of organic material, most often wood, during fossilization processes. Dendrolites provide valuable information about ancient environments and can sometimes resemble petrified wood.",
  "example": "The museum displayed a unique dendrolite that offered insights into prehistoric forest landscapes.",
