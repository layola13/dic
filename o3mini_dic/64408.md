  "definition": "In linguistics, ergatives refer to a class of verbs or grammatical constructions where the single argument of an intransitive verb corresponds syntactically to the object of a transitive verb. This alternation means that a verb can appear in a form where no explicit agent is mentioned (e.g., 'The door opened') or with an agent when used transitively (e.g., 'John opened the door').",
