  "translation": "无反应的；在某些罕见的上下文中可能涉及类似于应答或回应的事物",
  "definition": "The term 'desponsory' is extremely rare and not widely recognized in standard English dictionaries. It is presumed to function as an adjective describing something that does not respond or reply, or as a noun in a niche or technical context referring to a non-reactive state or element. In some liturgical or historical references, it might appear as a variant or mistaken form of 'responsory'—a chant spoken in response to a reading. However, in modern usage, its appearance is almost nonexistent, and its meaning is largely inferred from its components and context.",
  "example": "The engineers were puzzled by the desponsory behavior of the circuit, which failed to react as expected.",
