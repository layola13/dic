  "definition": "1. In theoretical physics, a counterterm is an additional term added to the Lagrangian (or other fundamental equations) to cancel out divergences arising in perturbative expansions, thereby rendering the calculated quantities finite. 2. More generally, it can refer to a term or phrase introduced to oppose, neutralize, or provide an adjustment to another term or idea.",
