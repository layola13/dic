  "definition": "The process of turning a non-compact space or structure into a compact one. In mathematics, this often involves adding 'points at infinity' or re-defining the topology so that the space becomes compact, which can simplify analysis and proofs. In physics, compactification refers to techniques such as reducing extra spatial dimensions to a finite size in theoretical models.",
