  "definition": "In group theory and abstract algebra, conjugacy refers to the relationship between two elements of a group. Two elements a and b are said to be conjugate if there exists an element x in the group such that b = x⁻¹ax. This concept is fundamental in understanding the structure and symmetry within groups.",
  "example": "In the symmetric group S3, all 3-cycles belong to the same conjugacy class.",
