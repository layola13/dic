  "definition": "A cryophorus is a simple scientific apparatus used to demonstrate the condensation of water vapor. Typically, it consists of two interconnected glass tubes or vessels, one of which is chilled (often by a cold liquid), thereby cooling the adjacent air and causing moisture to condense on the surface. It is commonly used in physics and chemistry experiments to illustrate principles of temperature, humidity, and phase change.",
  "example": "The professor set up a cryophorus to show how warm air loses moisture when cooled.",
