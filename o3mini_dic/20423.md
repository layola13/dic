  "definition": "A bitmap is a method for storing digital images as an array of bits. It represents an image as a rectangular grid of pixels, where each pixel is assigned a specific value that represents color, brightness, or transparency. Bitmaps are widely used in computer graphics and imaging for representing complex images.",
  "example": "The graphic designer exported the logo as a bitmap to maintain pixel-level detail.",
