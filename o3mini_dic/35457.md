  "translation": "聚胶作用",
  "definition": "A process of liquid–liquid phase separation in which a homogeneous solution of colloidal particles separates into two liquid phases: a dense, polymer-rich phase known as a coacervate, and a dilute, polymer-poor phase. This phenomenon is often employed in encapsulation techniques and has been studied in the context of the origin of life.",
  "example": "The researchers employed coacervation to encapsulate sensitive bioactive compounds in microcapsules.",
