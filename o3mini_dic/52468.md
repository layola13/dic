  "definition": "In music theory, a diesis is a very small interval—typically much smaller than a semitone—that appears in certain tuning systems and microtonal music. It can refer either to a minute pitch discrepancy used to adjust intonation or, in some contexts, to the sharp sign (♯) which raises a note by a semitone.",
