  "definition": "An archaic or rarely used term, 'ducture' appears to derive from the Latin root 'ducere' (to lead) and is thought to refer either to the act or result of leading and channeling or to a system of ducts (channels) for conveying substances such as air or fluids. In modern usage, the term is nearly obsolete and is chiefly encountered in historical or technical texts with specialized meanings.",
