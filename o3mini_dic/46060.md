  "definition": "Cycloganoidei is a scientific taxonomic group, typically used as a suborder designation in zoology. The term is derived from Greek roots where 'cyclo-' refers to circular or round features and '-ganoidei' suggests similarity to a particular form or structure. It is used to classify a group of organisms that share unique morphological or genetic characteristics distinguishing them from related groups.",
